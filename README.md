# GameStudies-TopicCurves
Here I investigate if there is a possibility to draw keyword development curves of imperative action verbs in video games using game transcripts from [Game Scripts Wiki](https://game-scripts-wiki.blogspot.com/).

## TODO:
- [x] crawl and clean transcripts
- [x] use word-level n-grams of variable sizes
- [x] calculate keyword importance for every n-gram using term frequency
- [x] plot relative importance for every keyword for all games and by genre
- [ ] expant analysis to all verbs instead of chosen verbs to avoid bias
- [ ] change preprocessing to only include verbs used in imperative fashion in tf value calculation
- [ ] cluster verbs to treat synonyms as the same verb (using cosine similarity on spaCy vectors?)
- [ ] calculate ANOVA or other tests to check for significant differences between genres
## Current challenge
Find time to continue...
