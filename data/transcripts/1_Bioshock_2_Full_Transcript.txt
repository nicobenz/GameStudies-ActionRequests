1958
Beneath the Atlantic Ocean

(Big Daddy slowly walks towards the ventilation shaft. He knocks on the shaft with his fist and Little Sister with a plush Big Daddy comes out of it.)

Eleanor: Look Daddy - it's you! Let's go out to play, Daddy!

(Eleanor pulls her Big Daddy by the hand. Daddy obediently follows her. Eleanor finds the corpse of some poor fellow, pierces it with a syringe, after which she eagerly drinks ADAM.)

Eleanor: Mmmm! (giggle) More angels, Daddy! This way!

(Eleanor runs into the door that opens before her. Big Daddy goes after her and gets to a party of high society. After a while, we hear Eleanor scream. Daddy runs to help.)

Eleanor: Daddy!

Tough Splicer: Get the ADAM!

Female Splicer: Come with us, little girl!

(Daddy jumps off the balcony, crushing one of the splicers.)

Tough Splicer: You want some, big guy?!

Masked Splicer: Bigger they are, harder they fall!

Tough Splicer: Get out of here, freak!

(Daddy brutalizes the splicers using his drill. The last of the splicers throws into him a plasmid that controls Big Daddy's and he’s turns off for a while. In the green fog, he sees Eleanor looking with frightened eyes at him. A woman approaches her.)

Lamb: There we are. He's perfectly safe now. This is not your daughter, do you understand? Her name is Eleanor. And she is mine. Now. Kneel, please.

(Big Daddy obeys.)

Lamb: Remove your helmet.

(Big Daddy obeys.)

Lamb: Now… take the pistol. Place it against your head.

(Big Daddy obeys.)

Lamb: Fire.

(Big Daddy shoots himself in the head. The screen fades and we hear Eleanor scream.)

Eleanor: Daddy!

 ADONIS LUXURY RESORT 
Ten Years Later

(The image slowly appears on the screen, and we hear radio interference.)

Tenenbaum: (into and out of static) Hello? Hello can you hear me? Your-your signal, it is very faint… (back into static)

(Big Daddy wakes up. He rises to his feet and goes to explore the surroundings. He goes to Adonis Baths.)

(Diary: Attention: Workers!)
"Big Kate" O'Malley: Lesson one, mop jockeys: You are under the ocean now. If you feel the soft patter of rain on your hat, you're already fired. Lesson two: you can jumpstart a dead generator with a direct spark, but clear the guests out of the pool first! Scares these rich pricks to watch a workin' stiff hurlin' thunderbolts, ya follow me?

(Big Daddy finds a sauna, closed to a combination lock. After unlocking he picks up a diary.)

(Diary: Fitness)
Rachelle Jacques: My husband is such a perfect idiot. Throws away all his spending money on Gene Tonics to affect a look of physical fitness… so he'll have an excuse to sit on his rear all day listening to radio serials! "Stephen," I tell him, "if you want to be fit, come swim laps with me, the old-fashioned way. It's your mind that's atrophying." Maybe I'll start sneaking some Brain Boost into his daily regimen…

(Having reached the Plasmid therapy, the memory of the Big Daddy is clarified for a brief moment and he hears the voice of Eleanor.)

Eleanor: Father…

(Big Daddy sees in front of him one of the Gatherer’s Gardens, around which everything is covered with messages from Eleanor. At the machine there is a gift - an electrical plasmid. Daddy takes the plasmid, groans and loses consciousness for a while. He wakes up and sees a Little Sister that looked just like Eleanor.)

Little Sister: Daddy was sleeping… for such a long time… and Eleanor has missed you… Find her and you'll be all better.

(Suddenly Little Sister is taken away by some creature, resembling the Big Daddies, but much quicker and dexterous. Big Daddy opens the door with his new plasmid and starts the generator. After that, Tennenbaum contacts him over the radio.)

Tenenbaum: Ahh at last… a signal! You, who are bringing this dead city to life, listen. My name, it is Tenenbaum. I know who you are… and I am in much need Of your help. Please find me in the Atlantic Express train station.

(Big Daddy goes to the toilet and picks up a diary there.)

(Diary: To My Daughter)
Sofia Lamb: To my daughter, Eleanor. Soon, you will be born, and Rapture will be your home. You shall be raised as I was, to advance the common good through social psychiatry. This city's potential is immeasurable, Eleanor... yet our beliefs are unwelcome here. Life will be difficult, but the price of revolution is always dear. If we are patient with her... Rapture will come to us.

(Going up to the second floor, Big Daddy hears the voice of Sofia Lamb from the loudspeakers.)

Sofia Lamb: This is Dr. Sofia Lamb with the message for the people. Remember, you’re not alone. Think of me not as leader, but as mother to the Rapture family.

(On the bench, Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: Return)
Brigid Tenenbaum: I am back in Rapture, after so many years. The Little Ones I rescued are grown up, and think of me no more. After what I once did to them, it was a joy to be forgotten. But now, all around the world -- children vanish by the sea. Kidnapped. And so, I return... in fear of what I already know: Someone is making new Little Ones... continuing my work, my sins. Even if I am to die for it -- I must stop them.

(Big Daddy goes to the Bathysphere Docking and finds a diary there.)

(Diary: They Called it Rapture)
Mark Meltzer: Barely made it down alive, but here it is -- and it's real. Rapture. This is where that thing took my... my poor baby girl. From what I saw in the sub, most of the city's in ruins. But there were lights here and there. And shapes, moving... I'm rambling. Scared, I guess. But maybe -- if I find this "Doctor Lamb" I keep hearing over the PA... I'll find Cindy too.

(Daddy walks into the Grand Foyer and sees a Little Sister, who takes ADAM out of the corpse. She waves to him happily, but then a heart-rending cry is heard and the very creature that stole the Little Sister appears and attacks the Daddy. After a short fight the creature escapes. We hear the voice of Sophia Lamb from the loudspeakers.)

Sofia Lamb: This is Dr. Sofia Lamb with the message for the people. Remember, The Big Sister is always watching. To steal ADAM is to steal from Rapture family. Your family.

(On the counter of the Cocktail Lounge Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: Generation)
Andrew Ryan: (sigh) Diane insisted that we spend a weekend at the Adonis, and already I find myself seeking a respite from my vacation. When she deems it necessary to chide me for working, the words dissolve into an endless, animal bleat. I founded Rapture to be free of law and god... to live among those for whom work is our wage! Yet, when Diane speaks of bearing my child... I am given pause. Until now, I had never considered my legacy. Perhaps... perhaps after the New Year.

(Daddy continues to chase the Big Sister. When he reaches the Demeter’s Banquet Hall, he encounters her again. The Big Sister pierces a huge glass and the stream of water blows our Daddy out into the ocean, but thanks to the waterproofing suit he survives and begins to explore the seabed. A few minutes later he hears Tenenbaum over the radio.)

Tenenbaum: In that suit, even the ocean cannot harm you. This is good. But Rapture is the death of many great men. Alone, you will not last long. You can still reach the train station. Find me there.

(In the destroyed and sunken bathysphere the Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: Escape from Rapture)
Sammy: All right, Diary -- last entry! ...Lizzy and I... we found a 'sphere and we're going home! Ain't that right, baby? Next stop, topside!
Lizzy: Oh, I love you. It was you who saved us, Sammy. It was you, button. I -- what was that? What's that sound?
Sammy: She's seen us! It's Lamb! Torpedo!!! ... I'll try to -- (scream)

(Daddy goes further. After passing through a small cave, he is getting away from the resort area and enters the city of Rapture. Going a little forward, he finds an entrance to the Atlantic Express, enters the transition chamber and drains the water.)

THE ATLANTIC EXPRESS
(After the water is drained, Tenenbaum contacts him.)

Tenenbaum: Ah, Herr Delta… you arrive, as the little ones said you would. Come upstairs to the ticket booth, and I will offer what I know of you.

(On the way, Daddy meets a splicer, but he runs away.)

Tenenbaum: Now, most who survive are like this. Splicers. They are drug addicts, vicious animals.

(Daddy comes to Train Workshop 6A. After dealing with some splicers, he hears the voice of Sofia Lamb from the loudspeakers.)

Sofia Lamb: This is Dr. Sofia Lamb. Andrew Ryan is dead, but the tyrant dwells within this walls. Remember, we reject the gene. We reject the self. We reject the tyrant.

(On a desk in the office room Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: The Great Chain Rattles)
Andrew Ryan: I am told that the people grow tense and isolated in the absence of the sun. Now… they clamor for a psychiatrist. Do they miss the state censor, I wonder? Wartime seizure of private assets? Or the Cheka police, vanishing them in the night? Regardless, this Lamb woman is said to be the foremost practitioner in her "field." Fine. If she can quiet the rattling of the great chain's weakest links… I will leave her to it.

(Daddy finds a room outside the gate and yanks the switch. The door to the room is locked, the light turns off, several TVs turn on, and on the screen we see Dr. Lamb.)

Lamb: I know you. That symbol on your hand marks you a dead man. Ten years, Subject Delta, since I watched you put a gun to your head -- and pull the trigger. But take heart… Out of your pain, Paradise was born. I don't know how you survived, but your suffering is over now. These men will ease your burden.

Lamb: Please understand that like all I have done, this… is an act of love.

Tenenbaum: It is Sofia Lamb! She has found you!

(Daddy fights the splicers sent by Dr. Lamb, but the floor cannot hold him and he falls to the lower level in the water. After a while, Tenenbaum contacts him over the radio.)

Tenenbaum: Now you know of the enemy we share. Sofia Lamb. The camera in your helmet allows me to watch through your eyes -- and help you to fight her.

(Reaching the Administrative Storage Daddy stumbles on a security camera.)

Tenenbaum: Careful! Security cameras belong to Lamb. But, if you are clever, they can be made to serve you.

(Neat-Postal, our Daddy has another glimpse, but this time we understand that this isn’t a memory, it is a kind of connection.)

Eleanor: Father… it's me, Eleanor. I know you're awake in there, I can feel it. Mother won't be able to… to toy with you like that, ever again. This Plasmid is for you… if I'm right, you can use it now! Please… find me.

(Daddy picks up a new plasmid – Telekinesis, after which he goes to Pumping Station and uses his new plasmid to take a new diary.)

(Diary: Mr. Tape Recorder)
Eleanor Lamb: Hello Mr. Diary. Want to play? "Actually, I'm quite busy right now, miss Eleanor. Maybe later." Well, all right. But do you mind if I take you apart while I wait? I promise I'll put you back together! "Wait! You can't do thaaaat... noooo... waaaaiiiit, wait Eleaaanoooorrrr..." (clattering)

(Returning tt-Postal Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: Just a Fad)
Prentice Mill: There would be no Rapture without me. No city without the Atlantic Express. Ryan took his first grand tour on my flagship coach! But these days, personal bathyspheres are all the rage. My rails only connect the oldest parts of Rapture now, and the city's just... just left me behind. Plenty of cash in the bank, though. This private vehicle craze will blow over soon.

(Daddy goes to Tran Workshop 6B and explores it.)

(Diary: What Happened to the People?)
Mark Meltzer: These... people are hooked on some kind of genetic wonder-drug called ADAM. I've read the word "Splicers" scribbled on walls like a warning. One of them... cornered me, and Christ, his face -- I had a gun, but I choked -- and then out of nowhere we both heard this... singing, and he took off like hell on wheels. It sounded like a kid -- a little girl! Cindy's alive... I know it in my gut.
(Daddy explores the Railway Cafe.)

(Diary: Ryan vs Lamb: Reality)
Ryan: White is not black, Doctor Lamb -- down is not up, and straw is not gold. Look around you. Rapture is no miracle -- it is a product of reason, impossible unless one and one are two, and A equates to A.
(Murmuring.)
Lamb: And yet... alone, each man is a prisoner to bias. Dream, delusion, or the pain of a phantom limb -- to one man, they are as real as rain. Reality is consensus... and the people are losing faith. Take a walk Andrew. It is raining in Rapture... and you have simply chosen not to notice.
(Applause.)

(Daddy returns to Train Workshop 6B and tries to pass into the next section, however one of the splicers inserts the iron pipe into the gears and a huge door blocks his way.)

Tenenbaum: Ach, Sofia Lamb is using the splicers against you… most Big Daddies are like her slaves, guarding the Little Ones… but someone has awakened you…

(Daddy easily removes the pipe with telekinesis.)

Lamb: I know of your bond with Eleanor, Delta. To save yourself, you will come for her. But Eleanor has a destiny… one you cannot share. There is no place for you in Paradise.

(Daddy goes further. In the Control Room, he finds a diary.)

(Diary: Know the Beast)
Sofia Lamb: In ethical psychiatry, we must account for the role of evolution. Depression, fits of panic, sexual pathos -- all responses to ancient selection pressure. The irony is that this theory is why Ryan's people invited me here. They mistake my study of natural law for the worship of competition. Remember, Eleanor -- one must know the beast before it can be slain.

(Reaching the Switching Hub, Daddy notices the cubes rolling off the steps. Having climbed the stairs, he again meets the Big Sister.)

Tenenbaum: Quickly… Head for the elevator!

(Daddy kills several splicers and goes into the elevator.)

Tenenbaum: Now… here is what the children tell me… You are a very Old Big Daddy… bonded for life to a single Little One. When you are apart for too long, your body begins to shut down. Like a coma. As long as the girl is in Rapture, you are trapped here as well. The name of your Little One is Eleanor Lamb. Daughter of Sofia. She is kept at Fontaine Futuristics, on the other side of the city. You must go there and save her… before it is too late.

(Daddy comes out of the elevator. Going to the Manager's Office, he finds a diary.)

(Diary: Improving on Suchong's Work)
Gilbert Alexander: Doctor Suchong's death was a nasty blow to the Protector program, but I'm gradually settling into his role, picking up the slack that his carelessness left behind. We are gaining steam again, but I'm not satisfied. Yes, the "Big Daddy" defends the girl… but he is programmed only for the fight, like a sheepdog who wanders off unless a wolf is tearing at his flock. When no aggressor is present, he regards his Little Sister as he might a common houseplant. We need something more, something stronger: an unbreakable physiological bond.

(Going to the Train Station, Daddy kills several splicers and finds the Ticket Booth.)

Tenenbaum: Here. In the ticket booth. Press the button so we can speak face to face.

(Daddy presses the button and the blinds on the booth rise. We meet Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum in person.)

Tenenbaum: You see? This is why I must fight Sofia Lamb. She is using the new Little Ones for… for something… and I have returned to rescue them. If I do not, more children will die for my sins and the Rapture nightmare will repeat forever. Now, we must talk of -

(Speech of Dr. Tenenbaum interrupts the voice of Sophia Lamb from the TV and loudspeakers.)

Lamb: Citizens Of Rapture: This is Subject Delta. Behind that mask hides an enemy Of the people without soul or sympathy.

Lamb: It is a beast apart and as Family. we must tear out its jaw and drive it back into the sea!

(The siren turns on.)

Brigid Tenenbaum: Lamb will take this place apart to find you please hold back the splicers until we escape!

(Daddy kills the splicers.)

Tenenbaum: Thank you. Now… I must leave you, and I am sorry for this. But there are others I must help before the city drowns. This man – Sinclair… he is an ally, and will guide you to Eleanor. Goodbye, Herr Delta… and good luck.

Sinclair: Well, look at you… a bona fide knight in armor - complete with iron horse. The name's Augustus Sinclair, sport. Esquire. Ol’ Tenenbaum an' I share an interest in the ol' Fontaine buildin' - the very same place you'll find Eleanor Lamb.

(Daddy searches the station and finds another diary.)

(Diary: The Situation)
Brigid Tenenbaum: Sofia Lamb has taken Rapture, and is responsible for stealing children from the surface. Her Splicers destroyed my submersible and forced me to run. But the ticket booth here is secure... and though I cannot trust him, Sinclair is a valuable ally. I have already rescued a few of the new Little Ones from Lamb. They all want to know how we will get home. I wish I had the right words for them.

(Daddy gets on the train and goes to Ryan Amusements.)

RYAN AMUSEMENTS
(While Daddy is traveling by train Sinclair speaks with him on the radio.)

Sinclair: Whoa there, now, better apply the brakes unless you're aimin' to dash yourself against that glacier up ahead. As you can see, chief, the station here's iced over. TO reach Eleanor Lamb at Fontaine Headquarters, we'll have to clear the way. Now, in order to melt that ice. You'll need a plasmid like a handful o' hellfire. We used to sell a fine old product called 'Incinerate' in the amusement park up yonder. Go on an' find a way in -- I've already been on all the rides.

(Explore the Park Entrance Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: Eleanor's Progress)
Sofia Lamb: Eleanor is progressing brilliantly. My physical participation in her birth was... minimized, of course -- it is vital that I am unhindered by nature's crude bias. I will be, above all, her intellectual progenitor... loyal not to her, but to the people she will ultimately save. But, I admit, it is with some measure of pride that I review her marks in standard intelligence tests. As an agent of our beliefs... she may surpass even me.

(Daddy gets to the Security Wing.)

Sinclair: You're a rare old model, son - 'Alpha Series,' I believe. Now, Rapture's full o' scientific wonderments just like you - an' if we can sell 'em to the world at my price, well - curin' your condition oughta be a cakewalk. Once we find Eleanor… the sky's the limit.

(In the Manager’s Office.)

(Diary: The Old Sheepdog)
Carlson Fiddle: I was hired to engineer a park the likes of which no man has seen, and now all I do is watch over it like a grizzled sheepdog. My first line of mechanical puppets made the children here coo with wonder. But Ryan thought my vision was immature... "antiquated," he said. This place could have been something magical, but instead he turned it into a school... no, a cathedral. Dedicated to himself.

(In the same room in which Daddy finds a diary there is Remote Hack Dart on the table. Daddy picks it up and Sinclair contacts him.)

Sinclair: Hack the door controls, that should pop it open.

(Daddy sees the Little Sister behind the glass and groans plaintively. Next to the glass on the table, he finds a ticket to the park.)

Sinclair: Jim Dandy. That'll getcha in the park. But buyin' Incinerate's gonna cost ADAM -- it's a sorta genetic goo that lets you rewrite whatever God gave you. The Little Sisters carry the stuff, as you may recall so you'll need to locate one. I heard whisperin' near the El Dorado Lounge. Have a look.

(Daddy goes to the entrance of the park and uses a ticket. Going inside he explores the Rapture Museum.)

(Diary: Volunteer)
Nina Carnegie: I love the kids in Ms. Englert's third grade class, but boy, I had NO idea what I was getting into, volunteering to chaperon this New Year's sleepover party at Ryan Amusements… Donny… Donny! Get down off of that exhibit, and I told you, spit out that gum! You'll choke! (Sigh) The kids' parents deserve a night off to enjoy New Years, but I'm at my wit's end -- Donny! I TOLD you --

(Entering the female toilet of the Gift Shop, Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: Rapture is Deliverance)
Sofia Lamb: I know the surface, Eleanor. I spent half a lifetime there, in service of the common good. But then, I heard my own words twisted by fat old men, squatting over the embers of Hiroshima. Were the modern world a patient in my care, I would diagnose it suicidal. On perhaps that point alone, Andrew Ryan is correct. Rapture... is deliverance.

(Getting to the floor above Daddy again hears the voice of Sophia Lamb through the loudspeakers.)

Lamb: Each of us has a moral duty to increase the common joy… and ease the common pain. Alone, we are nothing, mere engines of self-interest. Together. we are the Family, and through unity, we transcend the self.

(Daddy continues to explore the Gift Shop.)

(Diary: Cutting Corners)
Silas Bantam: Used to be there was no margin in runnin' the gift shop -- I couldn't hardly sell off this tourist crap for a penny more'n it cost to manufacture! Then I met this straight-shooter name'a Sinclair, and he laid a sweet deal on me. Said he's got some hard-luck folks down in Pauper's Drop can whip up this junk at half the cost I useta pay. Yeah, I've had to pick a needle or two out of the shipments, but all in all, nobody's the wiser... an' I'm all the richer.
(Daddy goes to El Dorado Lounge. After couple of minutes he hears Eleanor's voice again.)

Eleanor: Until you arrive, Father, I'm trapped here smuggling these gifts out is the most I can do to help…

(Next to the gift from Eleanor there is a diary.)

(Diary: Eat Dog)
Sofia Lamb: In ethical psychiatry, we must account for -- (the record abruptly ends).
Eleanor Lamb: (giggle) Eleanor Lamb speaking. Mum says I'm not to play with the other children, because they're "being raised on a diet of dog-eat-dog." I wanted to see these dog eaters ... so I waited until Mum was gone... and went out to find one... and guess what? The dog eaters wear human skins... it makes them look just like us!

(Daddy goes on and sees Big Daddy along with Little Sister.)

Sinclair: Now, that Big Daddy won't bite until you do, but to get to Lil' Sis. you gotta put the old boy down for good.

(Our Daddy fights and defeats the Big Daddy.)

Sinclair: Take a breath, son. You did it. Now, just let her ride on your shoulders and she'll trust you like her own Daddy.

(Daddy puts the Sister on his shoulder.)

Sinclair: We're in business. Now, there are corpses all over Rapture, and Lili Dimples there can sniff out the ADAM on 'em. Find one.

(In the same room, Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: "Child" and Guardian)
Mark Meltzer: I found one of those children at last. Filthy dress, all alone. I approached her… praying that it was my little girl. But she was… gorging herself on blood from a corpse. It wasn't her. I stared, just, just reeling, and then that skinny… armored freak that took Cindy jumped me, shrieking like an animal! I escaped but… could Cindy have become one of those… things? I've got to find her, now more than ever.

(Along the way, we hear the voice of Sophia Lamb from the loudspeakers.)

Lamb: Ryan was wrong. To hand sufficient power to any individual is to create a Tyrant. We must therefore eradicate tyranny at the genetic level. To end sin itself. That is the Family. That is our cause.

(Daddy finds the first corpse.)

Sinclair: She's got a juicy one! But when she starts drainin' out the ADAM, the splicers will come runnin’. Be ready before you set her down on that body.

Sinclair: Just put her right down on that corpse.

(Daddy drops the Little Sister.)

Lamb: That is a child of the Family, not a toy for you to exploit and discard. It is fitting that you expire here one more forgotten curio in Ryan's shrine to the self.

Sinclair: Here they come. Keep the splicers off her now ‘til she is finished or they’ll never give up the hunt.

(Daddy defeats all the splicers and again puts the Little Sister on his shoulder.)

Sinclair: Now you know the stakes, son. But a plasmid costs a bit more ADAM yet. Keep it up.

(On a desk in the Ride Maintenance room at the entrance to "Journey to the Surface" Daddy finds another diary.)

(Diary: You, Me, and 1959)
Nina Carnegie: I think all of the children have finally fallen asleep. And now that the park is all quiet… I can't sleep myself! I guess it's just you and me, Mr. Voice Recorder. You, me, and 1959. I wonder what the new year will -- What… what was that? Something's happened, the lights are going out. Kids, stay in your sleeping bags, it's going to be fine…

(In the Ride Cart Garage Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: Escape Plan)
Carlson Fiddle: I been rationing my supplies ever since the park got cut off from the rest of Rapture. Gotta stay strong. I'm holed up in this workshop, surrounded by those wailing brats, tryin' to beat their way in. They want my food, my guns... they want it all! But I've got a plan -- gonna fix up the transport sub that's been rusting in the maintenance bay. Then I'm gonna get the hell out of this hole. These animals want Rapture? They can have it.

(Daddy finds another corpse and sends Little Sister to gather ADAM.)

Lamb: I do not hate you, Delta… indeed, I care for you in equal measure to any other sentient creature. But I cannot sacrifice a thousand Of my children for one rebellious son.

(Daddy is attacked by many splicers, but he defeats them all.)

Sinclair: All right, chief, we've almost got enough ADAM now. To get the rest, you'll have to take care o' that Little Sister. There should be one of the air vents they favor in the workshop. Bring her down there.

(Daddy goes to look for a ventilation shaft. Along the way, he finds a diary.)

(Diary: Lamb the Problem, Sinclair the Solution)
Andrew Ryan: Lamb is becoming a problem. The woman is a damned collectivist -- here in Rapture -- how could the Council fail to see it? Worse, to hide her intent, she gulls these "patients" of hers into religious frenzy. A new Kremlin will rise and swallow the council house before they realized they've been had! I will not have my city swindled by the parasite, whatever its guise. It is time, I think, to call Sinclair.

(In thurney to the Surface, on the desk in the workshop Daddy finds another diary.)

(Diary: Truth is in the Body)
Sofia Lamb: Rapture is a paradise of the ego, Eleanor. Under Ryan, the voices of an entire city sing the virtues of greed and pride. But truth, rather, is in the body. Already they grow weary of struggling against one another in fruitless competition. Observe the bent backs, the drawn faces. "Ryan promised us more," they seem to say. "In what shall we now believe?" And Eleanor… it is our task to answer.

(On the way to the ventilation shaft, Daddy hears advice from Sinclair.)

Sinclair: Now Tannenbaum would have ya turn that Sister human again. You'll get just enough ADAM for our purposes, an' the girlsll likely try to repay ya somehow. But Rapture's a high-stakes town, son an' she's a jackpot. You just have to be willin' to fake it all. You'll harvest more ADAM than the price of one Plasmid… so the rest is gravy. Think about it… down here, it's your survival or hers.

(Daddy finds a ventilation shaft and decides to save the Little Sister.)

Sinclair: Well, our tin man had a heart all along. Personally, I call that a liability but you have enough ADAM now …barely. Head to the Hall of the Future an' splice up with Incinerate.

(Behind the family exhibit "Journey to the Surface" Daddy finds another diary.)

(Diary: Deterioration)
Nina Carnegie: Two weeks at my last count… two weeks since we were trapped in this rotten park. I haven't been eating… the children need all the supplies we've got left. Need them more than I do. I… I don't know what's gonna happen. I can feel myself getting weaker. The children have noticed the condition I'm in, of course… What will happen once I'm gone? They'll be… all alone…

(Then Daddy explores an alcove of the flooded room containing a Power to the People machine, he finds another diary.)

(Diary: Working for Sinclair)
Stanley Poole: I uh... met with Sinclair today, of "Sinclair Solutions". It's this pseudo-legal firm he set up to take problems Ryan doesn't want to admit he has, and make them go away. I could fill forty front pages at the Tribune with stories about this fella, if he wasn't payin' me not to. And he's got work for me, right? I ask what, and he flashes me these thousand dollar Steinman teeth, sayin' this job'll quote change history end quote.

(Another diary near the Security Camera.)

(Diary: Doctor Lamb)
Mike Novak: Third session today, with this amazing limey shrink. Doctor Sofia Lamb. She said that all Ryan's horseshit about always looking out for number one is turning us little guys against each other. And what we need is unity. Solidarity! Then she held up a mirror. Turns out, I wear my hair and mustache just like Ryan. So today, I'm spreading the word about Lamb. And tonight, I'm shaving my whole stupid head!

(Another diary in the maintenance hallway across from the Lighthouse.)

(Diary: Efficacy)
Andrew Ryan: I know this facility is vital to the preservation of secrecy in Rapture. But seeing myself transformed into that... lurching, waxen nightmare... do children truly respond to this? Still, I spoke to a young man exiting the park after the grand opening, asking him what, if anything, he had learned here. He said his chores didn't seem so bad anymore -- as long as mother wouldn't send him to the surface.

(In the locked "Employees Only" room Daddy finds another diary.)

(Diary: Dating Tip)
Devin LeMaster: I've got a little dating tip for ya, Jimbo, it'll get you out of that lonely hearts club for good. This scheme works 100 percent of the time, guaranteed. First, find some Betty and take her to Ryan Amusements. Then, ya go to the gift shop, buy her a Teddy Bear -- this is key, I ain't kiddin' around. Then... ya buy her a ticket on "Journey to the Surface." As soon as you hit that first scare: Bingo! Tunnel. Of. Love.

(Once in the Hall of the Future, Daddy meets several splicers. After defeating them, he examines the room.)

Lamb: So… you would drain the people of their life's blood. Rapture is a body, Delta. I am the voice… and Big Sister is the hand. When Rapture speaks of you – it says only this: Sleep now. Your day is done.

(Beside the Vita-Chamber Daddy finds a diary.)

(Diary: A Father's Love)
Gilbert Alexander: We lost another of the Alpha Series Protectors today in testing. Somewhere outside the city limits, he simply vanished. For these men, Rapture has no walls. We must find a method of conditioning them against abandonment of the Little Sisters. Something physical... possibly even lethal. The lab aides are starting to call them "Big Daddies"... perhaps there's some genius to that. Bonded pairs... connected by a love that kills.

(Daddy finds the Gatherer’s Garden and buys “Incinerate”. Returning to Hall of the Future, he stumbles upon the Big Sister and kills her.)

Sinclair: Holy Moses, son not even a Big Sister can keep you down! Well, come on back and melt the ice, an' we can say goodbye to this two-bit carny ride.

(Passing to the entrance to the park, Daddy hears the voice of Sophia Lamb from the loudspeakers.)

Lamb: Ryan saw the individual as a hero… a noble survivor. And Rapture was his Paradise…a shrine, to the supremacy of the self. The result? Slavery. Genocide. Chaos. Now that the Tyrant is dead, we are a true collective… a single family.

(On the way to the station, in a heap of debris under the ice lies a diary.)

(Diary: Disappeared)
Grace Holloway: He's gone. James was the only man I ever loved... now it's like he never even came to Rapture. He heard me sing at the Limbo Room, came up all bashful. He liked hearin' songs about what it's really like to live in this town... I think he's been trying to organize folks against Ryan, and now he's gone, and I'm here, singing "Rise, Rapture, Rise"... scared to death they're gonna come for me!

(Daddy goes to the station and destroys the ice barrier.)

Sinclair: Outstandin', sport. You're provin' to be quite a windfall. Now just open the train tunnel from the security booth there, and I'll come out an' jump on.

(Opening the tunnel, Daddy sees Sinclair outside the window.)

Sinclair: I like to look a man in the eye when I give him my word. You and me, kid we're goin' places!

Lamb: I had thought you some golem of Sinclair's, brought here to hold Rapture's arms while he rifles through her pockets. But no… You are aware of your plight. Who, I wonder, would be so cruel? To force a mirror on a man with no face…

Sinclair: Lamb was waitin' for us! Come out shootin' and start the train!

(Daddy goes to the station and kills the attacking splicers. He scours the park, picking up the remaining items and finding the last diary on the level.)

(Diary: Wooden Nickels)
Augustus Sinclair: Andrew Ryan. He reckoned the free market was some kinda holy spirit gonna lead us all over the rainbow -- and I reckon it's a big fat hooker too dim to spot a wooden nickel. So old Andy went an' became his own ghost, and I whittled nickels 'till I made a mint.

(Returning to the station, Daddy sits on the train and leaves the park.)

 PAUPER'S DROP 
(Approaching the station, Daddy sees how ordinary splicers fight with some large splicer and the voice of Sophia Lamb comes from the loudspeaker.)

Lamb: Attention. Subject Delta is now trapped in Pauper's Drop. All railcar travel is suspended until he is found. Remember – the enemy is alone. We are the Family.

Sinclair: Lamb's tryin’ to box us in, kid – this is a god-damned city-wide lockdown! To keep the train movin', you need the security override key from the local 'governor'… Grace Holloway. She kicked me out of my own hotel down here - The Sinclair Deluxe. Find her, an' get that key.

(Daddy goes to the Fishbowl.)

Grace Holloway: I remember you, monster. You stole Eleanor from me… twisted that baby girl into a thing so sick it can't even die… And now you come swanning into my neighborhood looking for me? Wrong turn, Tin Daddy. When we hang you from a streetlight, and you're choking out your last… I want you to remember my face…

(On the roof of Marlene's Flower Emporium.)

(Diary: Better Times with Lamb)
Grace Holloway: My folks lived in the St. Louis Hooverville in '32... and the Drop is worse by a mile. Nobody's supposed to live down here, city pissing on us. 'Never dry'. Ryan doesn't care and Fontaine's a damn crook, but Doctor Lamb cares. We're still people to her. She's offering free mental counseling on Sundays. When I go, I get the feeling she's got a plan for Rapture... and for me.

(Downstairs Daddy finds another diary.)

(Diary: Ryan vs Lamb: Religious Rights)
Ryan: Religious rights, Doctor? You are free to kneel before whatever tribal fetish you favor in the comfort of your own home. But in Rapture, liberty is our only law -- A man's only duty is to himself. To imply otherwise, therefore, is criminal.
Lamb: Ask yourself, Andrew -- what is your "Great Chain of Progress" but a faith? The chain is a symbol for an irrational force, guiding us towards ascension -- no less mystic than the crucifixes you seize and burn.
(Applause.)

(Entering Sinclair Deluxe and passing a little forward Daddy hears the voice of a splicer.)

Brute Splicer: Gracie says piss off an' die, ya tin shithouse!

(The splicer blasts the passage and demolishes it.)

Sinclair: Well, sport… I guess Gracie's home… but that big lug just dropped half my damn hotel in your way. Now, to break through that mess, I expect you're gonna have to work out how he got so burly. Find yourself a genetic research camera, son. You can pick up any number o' tricks from a splicer with one o 'those. Try the pawn shop downtown.

(Behind the Sinclair Deluxe reception desk.)

(Diary: Wrong Side of the Tracks)
Augustus Sinclair: Ol' Pauper's Drop's the worst neighborhood in Rapture -- but it's a hell of an opportunity to raise up some ah, affordable housin'. When Atlantic Express was constructin' their luxury passenger line, this place was hollowed out beneath as flophouses for the railway crew. Nobody was s'posed ta reside down here long-term -- but when you're broke in this town, you're not exactly swimmin' in alternatives. I don't favor spendin' more than an hour or so down here at a time. There ain't a side of the tracks more wrong than under 'em.

(Daddy comes through the wall smashed by a brutal splicer.)

Sinclair: Use that code you found on the keypad outside the clinic. Should getcha up on the rooftops.

(On the shrine to Prentice Mill in Town Square.)

(Diary: The End of the Line)
Prentice Mill: This is it. It's over. I built this railroad from nothing... played by Mr. Ryan's rules. But then he asks me to sink my own cash reserves into the banks to give Rapture some breathing room, and now... now Austen God damned Bathysphere wants to buy me out. Decommission the entire rail! I have no family... and no time for friends. I am the Atlantic Express... and this... this is the end of the line...

(Daddy finds a code to the locked door in Fontaine Clinics.)

(Diary: Clinic Code at the Fishbowl)
Tobias Riefers: What did they expect? You keep enough drugs stashed in this clinic to splice up a rhinoceros, of course every poor soul in the drop's gonna start beatin' down your door. It's my job to think up a new key code to keep 'em out. Seems like every other day now... Nuts... I'll mull it over for a while at the Fishbowl Diner.

(On the way to The Hamilton.)

Sinclair: Gracie's got the wrong idea… you're not responsible for turnin' Eleanor into a Little Sister. Big Daddies are just slaves... and you only recently broke free.

(After examining one of the offices in the Hamilton Daddy finds a new diary.)

(Diary: Camera in Hock)
Rock Flanagan: Another day, no clients. Atlas and Ryan start goin' at it hot and heavy, and all my business dries up. Used to be easy: put the eye on some spliced-up dame's wandering husband and rake in the dough. Now it's got so bad I hadda put my camera in hock at King Pawn. Makes a guy consider splicin' up himself... if I had two dimes to rub together, that is.

(Daddy finds the camera.)

Sinclair: That thing's a miracle in technicolor, kid. Works like a movie camera. Start the film rollin' before you open fire on a splicer, and then anything you hit him with tells you more about his Dee-En-Ay. Let's give it a dry run, shall we? (Daddy takes a photo) Easy now. Looks like you got the jump on this fella. Start your camera recordin' him, then hit him with a lit' bit of everything… plasmids, firearms, whatever you can dish out! (Daddy kills the splicer) That's it son! Camera spits out a prize once in a while as you learn what makes as splicer tick. Now, find one of those big ol' brutes, and take 'em out on film. Before long, you'll be able to brush aside that mess at the hotel. Usin’ that camera's a bit like tellin' a joke. Each time ya tell it the same way, it gets a little more stale so you gotta change it up to keep it fresh. Remember, son without usin' that Research Camera, we can't get to Gracie… an' that means we're stuck here. Get one of those big apes on film, then work 'im over. There's one of those big goons now. Start your camera rollin' on him and then let 'im have it! Look at you, sport a regular junior shutterbug! An' it appears you've picked up a new trick from that big galoot. Now get back to the Sinclair Deluxe and jus' bust through that mess blocking your way.

(On the way to Sinclair Deluxe Daddy picks up another gift from Eleanor.)

Eleanor: (through telepathy) Here, Father. It's yours. You are evolving quickly, but your heart is getting weaker. I can keep you alive, but you must find me!

(Daddy searches the Limbo Room.)

(Diary: Closing the Limbo Room)
Grace Holloway: That's it -- we have to close down the Limbo. Bomb goes off in that fancy place uptown, and everybody panics… pulls their money out of the banks… a whole city tuggin' on the same dollar bill. So the banks fold, and maybe one in ten got their savings out… who's going to come hear me nightingalin' about how broke they are? How am I going to provide for little Eleanor?

(On the way to Sinclair Deluxe.)

Lamb: For Grace, the paradise of Andrew Ryan was most unkind… she spoke against him in song, and he had her blacklisted… it left her penniless. But in the Family, she has found hope -- a reason to draw breath. Ask yourself, Delta… do you deserve to take it from her?

(Daddy stumbles upon a blockade at Sinclair Deluxe.)

Sinclair: Just rev up that drill o' yours an' slam right through that pile o' junk blockin' your way. Now, Gracie was on the top floor… get on up there an' persuade her to give ya that override key.

(Daddy explores Sinclair Deluxe.)

(Diary: Profit Coming, Profit Going)
Augustus Sinclair: Now, I'm a modest man. But my piecemeal needle scam's an outright masterpiece: some slob shacked up here buys a box of syringe parts from me for twice what it's worth. He assembles 'em in his rathole, and I buy back the finished product... for a dime against the dollar that I'll get from Ryan. Profit comin', profit goin'. Ol' Andy rambles on about the Great Chain... I got people shellin' out to pull it for me!

(Diary: The Butterfly)
Gideon Wyborn: The blue morpho bounces off the glass as I watch. I fold these paper effigies as secret badges, for the faithful. The morpho caterpillar doesn't spin a cocoon... it just grows armor on the inside... before the change. It is us. To wear a butterfly is to support Doctor Lamb and the Family. Before long, Rapture will split wide... and take wing. Imago is coming.

Sinclair: Gracie's room is just up ahead. Now, she's been sendin' all manner o' unkindness your way, so I'm not particular as to how you take that key away from her... but she's old... an' this grudge against you was based on o misunderstandin'.

(On the bed in Grace's room.)

(Diary: Failing Lamb)
Grace Holloway: Empty house. Only an echo to my name. Eleanor, baby... where are you? I turned my back, and someone took you -- it happened so quick. I'm not even a half-momma to you, girl. I couldn't protect you... This poster of Doctor Lamb in my room is staring me down like it knows I'm ashamed... I've always been loyal to your real mother, Eleanor... always trusted her with my secrets. But I lost you -- what will the Doctor think of me now?

(Daddy finds Grace’s secret hideout.)

Grace Holloway: I know what you're here for. Go on and take it… I won't have you touching me. Doctor Lamb trusted me to care for her child... and I tried... but baby Eleanor disappeared. And then one day I see her walkin' with you... lookin' wrong... and when I tried to hold her, you knocked me down, broke my jaw. So I'm ready, baby snatcher. Come on in and finish the job.

Sinclair: Your call, friend. Gracie's unarmed, for what it's worth.

(Daddy spares Grace’s life and walks away.)

Grace Holloway: To hell with you then! So on!

Sinclair: You're a bigger man than I am, chief. Maybe next time she'll think twice about pointin' fingers before all the facts are in. Now let's be on our way. Eleanor's waitin'.

Grace Holloway: You had me under a gun... yet you just walk away? No monster alive turns the other cheek. No monster does that. A thinking man does that. I know that Doctor Lamb is no liar, but she's got to be wrong about you. It doesn't seem right now letting you walk into that bush whack waiting outside. I can't call off the Family, but I can whisper a bit and improve your odds. These whirlybirds are custom jobs... by an old friend. I'm afraid this is all I can do... for now. Well, sir - I don't know what to call you now. You've done more than just spare my life, you've opened my eyes. I need to put a few questions to Doctor Lamb.

Lamb: By sparing Grace, do you seek to gain my trust? A feeble ruse. Your crocodile tears may poison her with doubt, but I am not so easy a mark.

Sinclair: Just take that override key, an' slot it into the control box in the ticket booth there. That'll open the gates. (Daddy gets to the train) Hop on, kid -- and start the train! Don't make me pull the whistle, now!

(Daddy leaves Pauper’s Drop)

SIREN ALLEY
(In the train...)

Father Wales: Hear me. O ye who would murder the Lamb of God! Ye shall never reach her garden!

(A rocket hits the train and Daddy falls into the ocean.)

Sinclair: Kid? Come on, wake up. Now there you are - I thought you rode that torpedo into the great hereafter! I'm in Dionysus Park now... train car's a shambles, leakin' air. Whole damn place is flooded and sealed. But there's a pumpin' station back there in Siren Alley -- an' I believe you could jerry-rig it to drain the park out. That'd letcha stroll right inside. Get to those pumps... and hurry.

(Daddy tries to open the door to the park.)

Sinclair: The park is sealed, chief -- you aren't gettin' in there just yet. But it ya get down to that pumpin' station in Siren Alley and drain the place out, this airlock'll letcha in.

Lamb: I see Father Wales has parted you from your craft, and yet you cling to life. Congratulations. Today, Delta, you meet a man who has no tear of death. And for Eleanor... he would burn with a smile.

(At the entrance to Little Eden Plaza.)

(Diary: A Silent God)
Simon Wales: Lord… what more do ye wish of me? Your wretch of a servant waits for word… I have followed the letter of the Holy Mother Lamb, though she will not tell me of the day of your return. I watched as ye smote down the false Father, Andrew Ryan -- who tempted us away from your radiant graze. But ye would not speak to me, Lord! I have built for ye this great temple and gathered your flock, yet still you are silent. Will ye not strike me poor brother blind so he may at last behold your glory, as was done to Paul on the road to Damascus? I am alone, Lord. Alone… and waiting for a sign.

(Daddy briefly fights with someone very jumpy and agile.)

Sinclair: Mother o' Mercy, I think that was Simon Wales. What's he done to himself? He and his brother were Rapture's architects, but when Doc Lamb came along Simon got religion. He's got a... kinda church down in the pumping station. Expect a reckoning when you arrive.

(Daddy finds another gift from Eleanor.)

Eleanor: I think mother knows I'm helping you like this... she's accelerating my treatments. Don't give up on me!

(Diary: Lamb’s Salvation)
Simon Wales: Daniel… you and I drafted Rapture's blueprint together… "Wales and Wales, Architects." Do you remember? But Andrew Ryan led us astray, my brother… turned us from the Almighty. Doctor Lamb offers you salvation, Daniel. I ask only for proof that the barest flicker of faith remains in you. I left a gift for you at the Pink Pearl, in your… offices. Find the code on it, brother, and we shall pray together for your sorry soul.

(After killing a Bouncer.)

Grace Holloway: I've got the maddening notion that I owe you my lite, stranger... such as it is. I'm sending a care package to the Pneumo along your way. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell Doctor Lamb.

(Daddy continues to explore his surroundings and hears his daughter's voice through telepathy.)

Eleanor: You're not alone, Father - the girls you rescued are on your side. Check the Gatherer's Garden for a package.

(Diary: Plasmid Shipment)
Jamle Byass: Listen, my supplier's got a new shipment of Plasmids comin' in, and I need you to pick'em up from the lab in Hedone Plaza. There's a hidden switch to open the back door -- it's tucked away under the cash register in the shopfront. And don't let nobody see you do it! Otherwise we'll have Splicers crawlin' all over the damn place tryin' ta get a taste.

Sinclair: The Pearl was among the ritziest lodgings in Rapture. But durin' the war the residents put themselves up for sale... Daniel's office is on the top ﬂoor, I believe.

(Diary: Double Standards)
Dusky Donovan: Sure, I've had Johns in my time and they've all got their kinks, but I think Rupert beats all. Keeps wanting me to splice up "in the act"… says it'll heighten it for both of us. I said honey, I ain't doing it for the heights, I'm doing it for the scratch. Besides, Danny would have a fit if I started needling. He does it himself, of course. But what's good for the gander gets the goose thrown off the Drop!

(Daddy sees someone agile at the top of the stairs.)

Sinclair: That has to be Daniel -- hunt him down an' pin his ears back, kid!

(Diary: The Date is the Code)
Daniel Wales: Tonight, I had a pain in me head, and this time it wasn't the whining of the whores. So naturally I came up to me office to murder it with a drink. And there on me liquor rack... was a bottle of sacramental wine from me dear brother Simon. And of course, the vintage date on the label is the code to enter his territory. Nineteen - nineteen. I should pass his bleedin' wine through me system and send it back warm.

Lamb: Faith, Delta... it lives within us, yet beyond us. Daniel Wales locked it - Father Simon Wales does not. The faithful do not die in tear, as you did... we achieve martyrdom.

Sinclair: Ah, now through this junction is the rest o’ the Alley, includin' the very pumpin' station we're offer. Father Wales has been recruitin' Holy Rollers down there for Lamb. They've cut the power on ya - you're stuck ‘til the back-ups kick in. I'll help you hold 'em back! Check the pneumo!

Father Wales: Know this, Beast... Daniel's body may go cold... but his soul rests with the child at the Lamb. You shall roast and blacken in the pit, and it'll be a grieving brother sends you there... Your sin itself marches to meet you, Beast -- and its name is legion! Eleanor Lamb is our salvation, demon... you shall not rob us at our final reward!

Sinclair: Atta boy, sport... I think you‘re closin' in on Simon's underground ‘temple.’ Now get down to Pumping Station #5 and drain out the park here. Oxygen’s runnin' thin in this train car, and I'd sure hate to see our partnership cut short.

Lamb: Ask yourself, Delta... you, who have suffered beyond measure at the hands at men like Ryan... what is the cost of paradise? To end pain... to end sin... what must we pay? Eleanor is my answer.

Gil Alexander: The Pair Band is a success! It somehow an Alpha Series wanders too far from his Little Sister, our physical tailgate kicks in: a chemical trigger that induces coma.

(Diary: Guidance of Lamb)
Father Wales: Andrew Ryan left us wandering contused and alone amongst yesterday's wreckage. But Sofia Lamb shows us that we are not alone, we are together, as a family. So when you see a man brought to his knees, recognize that he is your brother, and pull him up. But the Beast is upon us, children. It wears a hide ol Iron, and its hands are Death and Change. It would seize the Child from us, and with her, Paradise itself! Be ye soldier of the ground, or angel of the sky, ye must stand fast... and send it howling back to hell!

Sinclair: Pump control oughta... be in the back. One thing though... once you transfer the suction to Dionysus Park... we've got a tiny window of opportunity to get you inside. I don't have much air left, but I’m hang in there -- make sure you‘re ready before you throw that switch.

(Diary: The Creed of the Faithful)
Father Wales: We believe in the Daughter of the Lamb, hallowed savior and anointed vessel, whose blood with our blood sin with our sin, mind with our minds, life with our life, lifts us up from the depths, transcends base temptation, and delivers us all from ego. We commend ourselves to the New and Unknown borne by our common strength. and guided by the Lamb.

Lamb: Do you think me a Tyrant, Delta, vying for control at a dead man's dream? The city is nothing. Rapture must die, so that Eleanor may rise from its body. Allow me to demonstrate...

Sinclair: Lamb's overloadin' the pumps! The place is comin’ down! Get to Dionysus Park!

Lamb: Subject Delta. I want you to commit this moment to memory for me -- this... howling, brutish slog through the dark, this is who we are.

Sinclair: Get outta there, kid!

Lamb: Look. Delta, it is the world for which you strive. You... alone... among the dead.

 DIONYSUS PARK
Sinclair: Dionysus Park was owned by Sofia Lamb, chief... sort of a private retreat for her social experiments. One night it flooded -- killin' all her guests. Papers sold it was ‘cult-related.’ Come on up to the train station, let's rendezvous.

Lamb: Attention: Subject Delta has drained and infiltrated Dionysus Park. His death is our rebirth -- the tile of the People's Daughter is in your hands!

(Diary: Patronage)
Stanley Poole: Well I'm in -- yours truly is the newest member at the Rapture Family. I led Wales a line about how the Tribune was stopping me tram telling the people what‘s what -- and without a word, he hands me an invite to this ‘artist's retreat’ here at the park. Lamb bought my frustrated novelist act... she’s even sponsorin' me to ink it while I'm here. Except my story's all about her... and I don't think she's gonna like the way it ends.

Mark Meltzer: (from the other room) ... No! Get back! She's my little girl! (shoots the Big Sister)

Sinclair: Well the good news is, I've located a new train car. But the station's still locked down, an' we're not alone in here... I see a shadow in the security booth. I'll lay tow while you have a gander.

Stanley Poole: Well, hello boys. The name’s Stan Poole -- Rapture Tribune. Quality paper... before the locals stopped readin' and started findin' other uses for it. Anyway. I'm looking to cut a deal fellas. Come by the train station. I'm here in the booth.

Lamb: Dionysus Park was my home, Delta... an experiment in social unity cut short by human folly. You dishonor its memory with every step...

Stanley Poole: Now that -- see: Lamb knows you're here, but I'm incognito. Thing is, since you drained out the Park, the little Sisters are already startin' to nose around, lookin' for ADAM. And I can't have that.

Eleanor: (telepathically) Take this Father; and hurry... mother can't hear this but she's… she's looking right at me. And her face...

(Daddy finds Stanley in a booth at the train station.)

Stanley Poole: Okay. So dead men tell no tales right? Wrong. See, with ADAM involved, every stiff's got a story -- and Lamb knows how to read it. It that stuff makes it back to her I'm an obituary. So I want you to take the story at Dionysus Park... and bury it. Get rid of the Little Sisters for me... your way. Do that, and I’ll unlock the station here. Scout's honor.

Sinclair: Well I'd say “he's hidin' somethin” -- but he sort a' took the fun outta that one. He’s locked in the security booth, however -- so we'll have to play along. Find those Sisters.

(Diary: Truth in the Body)
Sofia Lamb: Awareness of self is no miracle, Eleanor... it is a trick of the gene, an endless inner retrain asking: “What's in it for me?” To serve the world, we must grow deal to the self. Are you ready? Now, stop listening to my voice. Stop listening. Stop. Difficult, isn't it? Human verbal cues are defensive coloration - camouflage. Play this recording until you no longer hear the words. Then you may observe the people for who they are.

Stanley Poole: Alright there's one. Clobber the big patooka and grab the Sister.

(Daddy kills the Bouncer.)

Stanley Poole: Smart -- see, you put her to work, and all that ADAM ends up in you! But you’re sort of a silent partner, so that's tops with me.

(Daddy chooses to save the Little Sister.)

Eleanor: (through visions) Father, this ADAM you've found contains memories from all the bodies here. Normally, only a Little Sister can see them... but I can show you what Stanley's trying to hide... When mother was taken away. Stanley was left in charge of Dionysus Park... he spent all her money, threw these mad parties -- it was like he was trying to ruin her...

Stanley Poole: You okay there... ? Keep your eye on the brass ring, brother. Find the rest of them Sisters. Subject Delta's just a serial number, amigo. I did a lot of diggin' on you for a feature once. They used to call Johnny Topside -- found the city all on your own in a divin' bell... real shame what they did to ya.

Lamb: You mistake my nature, Delta. I wish no ADAM for myself. Eleanor is the dream... and she needs neither weapons nor parlor tricks.

(Diary: Falling into Place)
Frank Fontaine: New face, I have a new goddamn face -- who'da thought? Rapture... paradise of the confidence man. I gotta keep revising the Atlas voice. I figure the accent gives me an excuse to lock myself in a room with a bottle and count the cash. War's on in lull now, boy ..and I've got a hell of a surprise for Andrew Ryan, long time comin'. And right about now, I expect the prodigal son is bookin' his flight...

Stanley Poole: There she is... get her! Hope that bodyguard ain't one at your long-losts.

(Daddy kills the Bouncer and saves the Little Sister.)

Eleanor: (through visions) That's me, there... I confronted Stanley -- said I'd tell mother what he had done. He panicked -- took me away and sold me to an orphanage I tried to light back. I remember biting his hand but…

(Diary: Gotta Keep it Together)
Stanley Poole: Ryan's goons are sweating me to prove this place is a closet commune, but I need time. And Lamb's kid keeps staring me down like she knows that I'm a phony. I keep thinking of Johnny Topside, though. Took real guts to find Rapture like he did... makes it easier not to crack if I sort of... imagine that I'm him. It's a good thing I can't tell Lamb about that though. She'd probably say I got a secret need to fall into his arms and make wild whoopee!

Stanley Poole: Now you were just a deep-sea explorer with iron cojones, pal... the public gave ya the nickname. But Ryan was sure you were a spook. So his people locked you up... erased your damn name! Goodbye Johnny Topside -- hello Subject Delta.

Sinclair: When all this is over - an‘ we're divvyin' up Rapture's bounty, you an' I will be holdin’ court on a private island, son. Think of it -- each world power on bended knee, holdtn' a bouquet made a’ money!

Lamb: ADAM is Rapture, Delta! The finest minds of Paradise in a single, sublime mosaic. Eleanor. Consider the genius you deny her with every drop stolen.

Eleanor: (telepathically) The girls you've saved from mother want to thank you, Father. Check the Gatherer's Garden.

Lamb: Through ADAM, Eleanor will become the Daughter of the People -- a true Utopian... brilliant beyond measure, but utterly selfless. As she ascends Delta, you and I will seem as dogs circling and snarling amid the afterbirth.

Stanley Poole: There she is... lil’ tyke wants to be in pictures. Real cute. Now get rid of the muscle and deal with her.

(Diary: A Secular Saint)
Gil Alexander: The genius of Sofia Lamb is a thing at empathy a profound moral sense; I can only describe her... as a kind of... of secular saint. But dividing her loyalty evenly across the world at large spreads it so thin as to be invisible to some, love... I have found, is... beneath her. Naturally, Ryan arrested her... gave her to Sinclair to incarcerate somewhere. But upon her escape, she took the city... and changed my life forever.

(Diary: Growing Up)
Gil Alexander: The Little Sisters are getting older... which is troubling. As they reach adolescence, they become aggressive, feral. Worse, the ADAM they ingest contains traces of lethal Plasmids left over from the war. The Splicers are becoming far more effective predators as well. Our Big Daddies are falling left and right. Perhaps... perhaps the elder Sisters could be trained to sniff out the lost ADAM, and reclaim it for us. Yes... from what I've seen, they certainly wouldn't have to wait for the culprit to die...

Eleanor: (through visions) With me gone. Father... Stanley just let mother's followers turn into animals. When word came that she was returning, he knew they would blame him -- so he found a way to silence them all... And now he's trying to cover it up...

Stanley Poole: That's it... now all that old dirt stays underground, and Lamb'll be none the wiser! Hey come on back, I've unlocked the train for ya! But remember, if Lamb catches ya, mum's the word.

Lamb: Delta... our conflict of interest seems to be upsetting Eleanor. For her sake, I have made it clear to these men that you are not to suffer. I accept lull responsibility for any anger you may experience before you die...

Sinclair: Doc Lambs turnin' up the heat, chief. Head on back to the train station‘ let’s hit the trail!

Lamb: Subject Delta... I have known for years of Stanley's betrayal here, and had forgiven him. But in compromising Eleanor now... he seals his fate. You see, it was Stanley who turned you in to Ryan. He is responsible for what you have become. The security booth is open now... you may have your revenge.

Stanley Poole: Sweet Jesus... Lamb knew...? And she just let me hang myself out to... oh god... now-now-now c'mon pal, the train's ready just... just let me live!

Eleanor: (telepathically) Mother‘s not lying this time. Father... he really did it... to both of us.

(Diary: A Plan)
Stanley Poole: So, Lamb broke out, and she's coming back. Wow. OK. Didn’t see that coming, but OK. That is going to be... what am I gonna do!? And I... I've heard some at these, a lot at these people down here, talking Some of them I know saw the thing with Eleanor, and who know who knows what. You can't just stop, you know, a whole... cult... from, from talking. Can you? Maybe you can. Yeah. Maybe you can.

(Daddy decides to let Stanley be, boards the train and leaves.)

FONTAINE FUTURISTICS
Sinclair: This is it, chief... end of the line. If I'm right, Eleanor’s momma's usin' ADAM to force all Rapture's minds an' memories into the poor girl... Lamb reckons it'll make that child a saint. Now Eleanor's in a deep dark place beneath Fontaine Headquarters... and to keep you alive, we need to sneak in an’ find her.

(Diary: Alone at Last)
Andrew Ryan: This facility belongs to the city now -- to Ryan Industries... at least until the rioting subsides. White it is unfortunate that such measures had to be taken... I must admit, it is gratifying to see this building condemned. Fontaine is gone, Lamb is gone... or close enough. I am alone at last... alone with my city.

(Daddy comes across one of these new things – a TV, on which he sees a recording from Gilbert Alexander.)

Gil Alexander: October 9th, 1967. Hello. (Ahem.) My name is Gilbert Alexander, and by the time you hear this, I will be clinically insane, I-I am recording these diaries in advance, as a... last-ditch effort to assist anyone I might... threaten... in dealing with me. My next message awaits you beyond the security checkpoint. The bio-scan will ensure that you're sane enough to need it.

Sinclair: Hmmm... Gil Alexander... as I recall he was involved in Big Daddy development from the beginning, likely had something to do with you an' Eleanor, son.

(Daddy goes to the next building of Fontaine Futuristics. It is the voice of Gilbert but it seems to be different.)

Alex the Great: He’s stealing office supplies, the cheeky little bugger! Company ADAM, from company stock - I saw him job it into his arm! Search him!

Alex the Great: MISTER A? I am your employer, boy! What is my name? Dismissed! Fired! Terminated! I hope that was instructive for the rest of you. Oho! Come back to line your pockets with more Fontaine ingenuity have you? Understand, sir, that I am the body corporate! Understand, sir, that I am Alex the Great! A company is an organism, my friend - t can piss you right back out into the ocean, with just a little squeeze...

Sinclair: Alex the Great?! Oh hell, that has to be Gil Alexander, same man who tell that message we’re followin'. He sounds mad as a March hare now.

(Daddy trying to activate Bio-Scan.)

Security Scanner: Initiating bio-scan. Identifying clearance level... Identified: Clinical Trial Subject. Classification: Protector. Designation: Delta. Status: Deceased. ERROR. Updating status... please stand by...

Alex the Great: What‘s this? My secretary vouches for you! Delta, eh... you're one of our old Protectors, yes? You're a line product, Delta! Fine product. Built to last. Say, don't look now, but I believe one of your old colleagues wants to welcome you back to the office!

(He sends a new model of Big Daddy – Alpha Series - to attack out Daddy, but he brings it to his shame.)

Security Scanner: Designation: Delta. Status updated. Status: Active. Access granted.

(Daddy sees a new video message from Gilbert.)

Gil Alexander: Hello again, I... I have been exposed to a massive dose at substance ADAM. By the time you hear this, I will have armed this facility's defenses en masse. You, my friend must therefore penetrate them… and… kill me... Please believe that it I could have done it myself... Ah... and on that cheery note, you may use the diary lying near this screen to bypass the vocal print locks ahead and enter the security office. The password is... ‘Agnus Dei.’

(Daddy finds a recording where Gilbert says the password out loud. He goes to the security door.)

Security Scanner: Please speak password to enter.

Gil Alexander: ‘Agnus Dei.’

Security Scanner: Access granted. Welcome Gil Alexander.

Alex the Great: I heard that! My likeness is company property. Delta, just like you are. Don’t make me strip you for parts, me laddo!

(Daddy goes to Gilbert’s office and trying to open its voice activated lock...)

Security Scanner: Please speak password to enter.

(Suddenly a security robot with a TV attached to it appears.)

Alex the Great: I warned you! Ahem.

(He struck the lock with a lighting bolt and starts to sing.)

Alex the Great: WHEN YOU'RE DOWN IN THE MOUTH AND LIFE'S A PAIN WEATHERMAN SAYS ‘HEAVY RAIN’! A LITTLE BOOST IS ALL YOU NEED, AVERAGE JOE TO HERCULES -
 STRONGER ARM AND SHARPER BRAIN, THAT'S WHY THE FUTURE IS FONTAINE! (laughs)

Security Scanner: Access denied. Please speak clearly. Automatic deactivation for 60 seconds.

Sinclair: Aw, he's jammin' the voiceprint lock with that awful croonin'! See it you can find some way to sabotage his control at building security.

Alex the Great: Delta... you're dawdling. The security office is well above your pay grade. If you're so keen to help, the restrooms need a good scrub. Here's a clerk or two to help you along!

(Diary: Means of Control)
Sofia Lamb: Prison, it seems was a blessing -- Ryan is now dead by his own son's hand. But far more interesting is the program at compulsion bred into his child, coded W-Y-K. It was some manner at verbal ‘trigger phrase’ which the boy would obey as an order unerringly. In a way, this sad thing, this... half-man had escaped the self. Highly intelligent, but devoid of so called ‘free will.’ with all its convenient blind spots. What if it had been instructed to uphold the common good? What it he were a volunteer?

(Daddy bypassing the security door...)

Alex the Great: Don't you dare touch that signal relay. Delta... Its value is ten times your own! I'm very disappointed in you. Delta... destruction at a Fontaine asset is punishable by summary dismissal! Shall I simplify that for you? Fired! Fired! Fired!

Gil Alexander: Thanks to new plasmid technologies being developed here at Fontaine Futuristics anything is possible: the power at the Gods is yours. All of our procedures are quick, painless, and safe.

Alex the Great: Yes congratulations... you've won a battle at wits with a home appliance.

Security Scanner: Please speak password to enter.

Alex the Great: WHEN YOU'RE DOWN IN THE MOUTH AND LIFE'S A PAIN WEATHERMAN SAYS ‘HEAVY RAIN’!

Security Scanner: Access denied. Please speak clearly. Automatic deactivation for 60 seconds.

Lamb: The Tyrant has no family, no friends, no country -- only slaves, chained in his wake. To his fellows, he asks: ‘of what use are you to me?’ Those who love him are his subjects -- for the Tyrant accepts only worship... or tear. The Tyrant looks upon the world saying: ‘All at this is mine,’ and by force or guile, he makes it so. To the Tyrant, the whole at creation is held in the relative -- sun and moon revolve for him alone. For the Tyrant even justice is whimsy - - he alone is fit to weigh, to measure... and to cut.

(Diary: A New Cognitive Model)
Sofia Lamb: This... this calls everything into question. Even as I record this I can scarcely believe... Psychiatry has been my continual study... to chart consciousness in all its strata. But intelligence does not require introspection ..the son at Ryan was more effective than all his self-aware rivals. He lived without questions. I could end the self... and save the world.

(Diary: Life After Sisterhood)
Eleanor Lamb: This is Eleanor Lamb speaking. It's been many years since my last Diary. Mother found a way to rehabilitate me psychologically, but she can't remove this... this thing inside my body. I look in the mirror, and I see a freak. I remember very little -- just an artificial sense of peace and a compulsive hunger for ADAM. Doctor Alexander is trying to help me adjust. He's responsible for part of my condition, but he wants to make amends.

Lamb: Each new Tyrant ventured here in search at conquest, Delta. Fontaine. Ryan. And now you. But every aspiring Caesar must learn to tear the knives at his fellows. Ask yourself... what does Sinclair stand to gain in guiding you here?

Alex the Great: (luring Daddy into a trap) Surprise, Delta! Hahahhahahahah!

Alex the Great: ADAM, Delta! One little lab in the arm, and even a hopeless under performer can be employee at the month! And you should know. Look around... is any at this... familiar?

(Alex luring Daddy into a Theater and forcing him to participate in his sick show...)

Alex the Great: Ladies and Gentlemen... Fontaine Futuristics invites you to shed your skepticism, evolve your expectations and dissolve your doubt... as we unveil the revolutionary power at our Home Defense Plasmid Series! Come now, don't be shy! How about you sir? No, he's positively rigid! You, ma'am at the back! Come on down! Let's give her a hand, folks! Astonishing! I may taint! A round at applause, please for Subject Delta and the power at Plasmids! Oh dear. Subject Delta! It looks like you've upstaged a fellow demonstrator and he's here to steal the show! What will Delta do now folks? Still a winner, Delta! The tour was never the same without you! If it wasn't for the madness caused by banding you to a single, fragile little ghoul - the Alpha Series would've been our pride and joy. Insubordination! Severance package canceled! Benefits... benefits rescinded... I... I…

(Daddy defeats everyone and destroys the jammer. He goes back to Gilbert’s office.)

Gil Alexander: “Agnus Dei.”

Security Scanner: Access granted. Welcome, Gil Alexander.

Gil Alexander: Hello again. I must assume by now that you’re willing to help end my life. In exchange, I have prepared a friendly security escort for you. Ah, now... there's a switch in here which will allow you access to the real laboratories, where... where what’s left at me awaits you. Please - use it.

(Daddy heads to Plasmid Laboratory to finally face Alex the Great.)

Sinclair: As I recall from my time doin’ business with the owners ..that Oxy-Fill station out there's just a front for a kinda hidden passage leadin' down below. If Lamb's hidin' Eleanor from ya... that’s where she'll be.

Gil Alexander: I'm afraid the lights in here sting my eyes terribly now. Until you arrive to deal with me, they will remain off. Please, locate the breakers and flip them, and then return here to restore power.

(Diary: Solving for X)
Gil Alexander: Sofia believes the perfect human altruist is ‘just a formula, waiting on us to solve for X.’ Intelligence and consciousness are not the same, she argued. Awareness of self naturally becomes obsession with it. So if we could suppress my sense of self, but imbue me with the cognitive capacity to serve the common welfare... we could thereby generate the first Utopian. And then, Sofia said... at long last... Utopia would follow.

(Daddy activates the Power Mains.)

Gil Alexander: Sofia and I knew that to create the first true Utopian would come at a high cast, my friend. We needed someone to be host to all that ADAM... Rapture's finest minds. A wilting subject. That is to say... myself.

Alex the Great: (Short Scream)

Gil Alexander: Whatever you may have seen inside the tank, that was indeed me. I fear the fate of Eleanor Lamb will be less physical, but no less grotesque. This tank for deep sea lite is the Ideal way to... to dispose of me. But first, you must retrieve enough ADAM-infused plant lite to lure me out. The slugs feed on the stuff, and it's... all I seem to want now. I have left a sample here so you know what to look for.

Alex the Great: I see you out there, Delta! You want to be top man? You want to sit in the big chair? Well, come and take it!

Sinclair: Well listen son, those override keys you‘ve been huntin' are genetically encoded. And to get to Eleanor you're gonna need one from ‘Alex the Great’ in there. Sinclair. First thing's first -- we gotta pin him down. Find those plants he mentioned and lure him back out.

(Diary: Gil’s Place in the Plan)
Sofia Lamb: Dr. Alexander has agreed to accept both measures of the New Utopian project. He will become a kind of genetic chimera, host to all the minds of Rapture, accessing their talents and memories via the ADAM we have gathered. And, deriving in part from project W-Y-K, I have developed a new set of behavioral constraints: Dr. Alexander will live to promote the common good... his love and loyalty shall be spread evenly across the entire human race. For me, that is discipline, at great personal cost. For him, at last... it will be instinct.

Alex the Great: We can’t have you running around the laboratories in your condition!

Sinclair: Poor things -- what a life. Marchin' around playin' Daddy until some splicer manages to kill all their Sister... and then if the coma doesn't take 'em they turn maniac... nothin' left to do but scream. Uh, no offense intended son. We better get you to Eleanor on the double.

Lamb: Your body begins to tear itself apart; the compulsion to find Eleanor will drive you to madness or coma. You have no claim on her -- your design was among Rapture's greatest sins -- and yet you persist. Why?

(Daddy sees another vision from Eleanor.)

Eleanor: This is where they bound us together, Father... playing God... you were the only good thing that Rapture ever gave me…

(Daddy continues to gather ADAM-infused plants. He gathered ¾ of the necessary quantity.)

Lamb: She was not meant to have a father, Delta. She was to be an heir to my life's work. And this is where they changed her, banding her to you. The child she was... died in this room.

(Diary: Goodbye, Dr. Alexander)
Eleanor Lamb: Mother has destroyed Doctor Alexander... she tried to splice him into some kind of living saint who would calculate the common good and adhere to it tirelessly. But now he's become... something unspeakable.

(Daddy sees another vision from Eleanor.)

Eleanor: The girls are whispering. Father... they've felt you a present at the Gatherer’s Garden... take it…

(Daddy collects all plants...)

Sinclair: All right sport time to feed the fish. Head on back to Alexander's tank and put those plants in.

Lamb: Poor Gilbert. It was his will to die. Delta To serve the majority by protecting them from his lunacy. Your entire journey here is based on your refusal to do the same. Will you grant his request, knowing that he served the Family?

Sinclair: Rebirth, hunh? Sure, you live forever, but minus your body. I like my body, kid. I don't feature the idea of my memories and personality bein' stored in the head of some saintly child... like just one more dusty book in the library…

(Daddy goes back to the tank with the remains of doctor Alexander. He pushes a button.)

Security Scanner: Deep sea life catchment system online.

Alex the Great: NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEES! Subject Delta is hereby dismissed!!! Escort him from the premises! No... I don't want it... I shall resist! How dare you try to... buy me out with this... this bribe... this... pittance. this... sublime... God damn you, Delta...

Sinclair: (Quick laugh) Perfect son, you reeled him in - now, use that console there to take a gene sample. It should print up a genetic key automatically! The key's all ready, go on and take it!

(Daddy grabs fairly a earned key.)

Sinclair: You got the key to Lamb's hideout, sport -- Eleanor's down there! Now just head out to the Oxy-Fill station and use it.

Gil Alexander: It is done. The sample disposal button on the panel in front of you will administer a massive jolt of electricity to the tank, more than enough to kill me. Whatever I may say to dissuade you, do not listen. The man whose voice you hear now is long gone. As my mind fades, I find my thoughts turn to the suffering that Eleanor will be made to endure, and I am overcome with pity. But I can only alter my feeble prayers. Perhaps alter my death you can do more. Now please... I ask you to grant me peace. Goodbye, my friend, and thank you.

(Daddy goes back to the Oxy-Fill station, uses the key and opens a secret door...)

PERSEPHONE
Sinclair: Persephone... we're finally here. Find Eleanor, son -- and fast. Her momma's got all Rapture dyin' to keep you two apart…

(Daddy sees another vision from Eleanor.)

Eleanor: Father, come quickly. I'm trapped in a cage... something's wrong...

Lamb: I wonder, Delta, do you know why you are here? Have you any idea what my daughter has given you? As I watch you now. I envy your ignorance. You still believe...

(Diary: Selling Ryan Short)
Augustus Sinclair: Persephone... secret home a' Sinclair Solutions. I bet against Andy Ryan's vision o’ harmony in Rapture -- offered him a quiet place to send anybody who wasn't workin' out. And now I’m sittin' on my own private think tank. Technically Utopia shouldn't have much use for a detention facility... but if you do business as long as I have... well, you learn to pick a brand name from the writin’ on the wall.

(Daddy comes to the locked Quarantine Area with Eleanor lying on her bed. It feels like the last citadel right there, an achievement, accomplishment.)

Sinclair: That's her, son! Eleanor Lamb. No matter what you might be feelin' right now -- this is business. Get that cage open - she's comin’ with us!

(He pushes the button on the door.)

Quarantine Announcement: Warning. Quarantine seal disengaging. Please stand by...

Lamb: How will she remember us, offer this moment? I have placed my pieces on the board as expected -- as have you. Is this what she hoped for? Mother and Father locking eyes... yet still we are blind. Goodbye, Subject Delta -- and take heart, for you at least, have escaped your legacy…

(The area is tightly locked and two Big Sisters attack our Daddy. He gave it all to defeat them.)

Quarantine Announcement: Internal scan complete. Please step into the decontamination chamber.

Sinclair: Hurry now -- quarantine chamber's waitin' on you! Get in there! Your signal's breakin’ up... I can't see or hear a thing -- something about that room is blocking me!

(The door in the quarantine room is still open. Sofia Lamb walks to Eleanor’s bed from the shadows.)

Lamb: Look at her, Delta. Ten years, and still she dreams of you.

Quarantine Announcement: 50 seconds remaining.

Lamb: Do you know why Eleanor brought you here? She wanted a Father. So she found a way to restore you in body and mind.

(We see that it was Eleanor who revives the Daddy through Vita Chamber...)

Lamb: And she has been watching you ever since, exalting your every act as gospel. The girl lying on that bed is no longer my child, nor my life's work. She is a monster shaped by you alone. Just as she has always wanted.

Quarantine Announcement: 20 seconds remaining.

Lamb: But there is one detail of your mutual band she tailed to account for. Your body was designed to lapse into a coma when her heart ceases to beat. Eleanor... forgive me.

(She choking Eleanor with a pillow. Daddy of the last strength crawls into the room but it's too late - Eleanor is dead. Her lifeless body falls from the bed next to him…)

(Daddy gradually comes to life in a room with a lot of TVs. He hears the voice of Sophia Lamb.)

Lamb: Watch him. His body is shutting down now, naturally... but if he dies of trauma he will return elsewhere. Full restraints at all times. No one enters this room until he expires.

Eleanor: Father... It's me. Eleanor. I‘m so sorry... mother stopped my heart, long enough to sever our band. Staying near me won't stop you from dying now... or worse. But I can still help you escape! this Little Sister’s brought you something that will allow you to take control at her.

(A Little Sister comes up to Daddy and injects him with something with her huge syringe. We get the opportunity to control Little Sister and see the world through their eyes. The game world is completely transformed. Instead of dirty dilapidated walls - silk fabrics. Instead of blood stained floors - expensive carpets. Splicers seem silly fairies, and Big Daddy - the ancient Egyptian soldiers in armor. Mind blowing.)

Eleanor: I know this feels a bit strange, Father, but now you can see through her eyes and tell her where to go. This is how I brought you back without mother catching on. Now... first, let's get you out of here. Good. Now, inside mother‘s office, there's a way to unlock these chambers she's holding us in. Find a way to slip in there. You're in. There should be a lever in here somewhere. Pull it, and it will unlock our cells. What mother did to me tell me very weak, or I would do this part myself. To save your tile. I'm going to have to change... to be like you. From here, you should be able to locate the pieces at a Big Sister suit... please, bring them to me.

(Daddy in a Little Sister from explore this fantasy world to find the suit pieces.)

Splicer: Pssst... over here. I can help you.

Eleanor: There's a piece on the suit in here, Father. Find the rest and bring them back to me...

Eleanor: Ten years. Father stuck in this... this lever dream, mother kept me sedated in order to ‘perfect’ my mind with ADAM. To her, the ideal child is a genius, serving the common good without questioning it. You have saved me from that. The other Sisters are made from me, in part. As they grow up in Rapture, I feel it all. When you were with the little ones, they trusted you as their Father, because of me...

(Daddy finds all the suit pieces.)

Eleanor: Mother was right about one thing. I have been watching you, Father... studying the way you have treated others. And now I know who I am... I am free -- after everything mother has done to me -- I am alive and sane enough to be curious about the sun. When you rescued my new Sisters. I tell every one. And it gave me hope for the first time in years…

(Daddy goes back to the quarantine room and gives the suit pieces to Eleanor. And yes, she is alive. Apparently she fell out of the Vita Chamber and crawled to her bed… She becomes a Big Sister.)

Eleanor: Now I will do the same for all the others -- starting with this one.

(She heals the Little Sister in which the mind of our Daddy is in. He goes back to his body.)

Eleanor: We've done it, Father. I’ll be there soon...

(Eleanor walks into the room where our Daddy is held.)

Eleanor: These suits always did make me think of you. Father -- I guess I still remember you in shining armor. But now it's my turn to tight for you. Take this Plasmid -- you can use it to call me to your side in a fight.

(Together they bring hell to the splicers...)

Lamb: Subject Delta... I know you can hear me. You have stolen my life's work, and with it – my only daughter. But Rapture is the house of monsters. The surface will not have us. Tonight, we shall be buried as a family. Side by side. (for some reason the voice actress says “And now” instead of “Tonight”)

Eleanor: Oh god, she’s going to drop this building into the trench... it's miles deep! We have to find Sinclair!

INNER PERSEPHONE
Eleanor: Upstairs, Father, quickly. This is Sinclair's Lifeboat, Father, out the window here. It's our only chance of escape. From what I know of Sinclair, he wouldn't just abandon it...

Lamb: Yes. Delta, what at Sinclair? The man who would sell Paradise... and where is he now?

Security Announcer: Warning. A security curfew is in now effect. All cells and bulkheads are sealed until further notice.

Lamb: This facility hangs over an ocean trench, Delta. The Family has activated timed charges within its foundations. Surrender before detonation, or we shall tall and be crushed in the abyss below.

Eleanor: Mother has locked all at Persephone down, including the gangway leading to the lifeboat. We can reverse it from the Holding wing, if we hurry. Come on! Use the Plasmid if you need me, Father... I'm going to have a look around.

Lamb: This is an emergency. Subject Delta has escaped. Eleanor Lamb has turned on her own people. Stand and fight... or the Rapture Family falls together.

Eleanor: We have to get you out of Rapture Father. It's the only way I can save you now...

Security Announcer: Beginning Admission Sequence.

(Daddy sees a Big Daddy… He seems lost and in pain.)

Lamb: Don't you recognize Sinclair Delta? Now, he is what you should have been: one final Alpha Series, ready to die for the Family. As Persephone's former owner, he is the ideal man to put you back in your cage.

Eleanor: Mother's controlling Sinclair. Father -- and he's got the master key! Catch him!

Sinclair: Kid... Lamb's in my head... I can't help myself... have to tight just to talk... felt me my goddamn tongue to torture the bomb codes outta me... she wants me to stop you leavin'... I... I’m sorry…

Lamb: Eleanor, I know you can hear me. I am inside Sinclair's lifeboat now. Delta cannot reach me here -- but you can. You need not die with him. We... we shall return to the surface together. If you will only step inside and accept your duty. Remember Eleanor... Mummy loves you.

Eleanor: Ah yes... mother's testing me. One last game. Fortunately by now I'm the world's foremost expert at breaking her rules... I've made my choice. Father... and it needs be -- I'll die for it.

Sinclair: Kid... I'm sorry... I've... I've locked you in here... Lamb’s makin' me dance on her goddamn strings... I can’t stop... you're gonna have to break in here an'... an' put me down. Wish there was... another way... but I'd rather die a man than live like this... I'd tell you the code to that... that keypad it I could... It's like Lamb’s put... walls up in my head... but, but the prisoners here mighta worked out the number. Check the cells... and please hurry... hurts to keep singin' out without say-so... an' I’m startin' to forget the words...

Eleanor: God... he's right Father. Mother’s betting you'll die in here, or that I’ll abandon you before the bombs detonate. We can't save Sinclair now... we need that key from him! Find the code to the watchtower, or work out a way to draw him out.

(Diary: A Trade)
Dodge: Hey Murphy, it's Dodge. A little birdie told me you found out the Warden's code. Send a message to my cell in Block A telling me where you hid the code and I'll consider your debts paid.

Sinclair: Son... I built this place, an' I did rent you out to those Plasmid Trials up at Fontaine... an' now... now I'm paying for it. Wish I had time to make amends... I - take the lifeboat. It's all yours. Just don't leave me like this…

(Diary: First Two Digits)
Mattson: The warden's ignored my warnings for far too long. I'm taking this into my own hands. I've secured a hack tool to nullify his turrets and subvert the bots. I also figured out the code. It's two, six... (Warping Sound)

Sinclair: Good... good, son... that's halt the code... now, find the rest…

(Diary: Last Two Digits)
Connor: I caught a glimpse at the warden entering the code to the tower today. Last two digits were seven and three. Didn't catch the rest... maybe I can just figure it out, trial and error. Wander how long that'd take.

Sinclair: That’s the full code, kid... you've done it, now... now just come on in here an'... an' put me down easy...

Eleanor: Sinclair is moving, Father. Track him down, we need that key!

(Daddy is forced to put Sinclair down...)

Sinclair: (horrible choking cough) So long... kid (cough)... thank you...

Eleanor: Now, Father. I’m afraid that ending the lockdown means releasing all the prisoners. So please, be ready before you use that key on the override switch.

(Diary: Magic Sauce)
Warden Nigel Weir: Lamb's attention seems to have drifted from my prisoners to her daughter. Guess she figures they’re irredeemable. Now I got guys clamoring for their next fix of ADAM, and I've gotta pull teeth to squeeze any out at the good Doctor. Guess I'm lucky her treatments kept them too weak to storm the lower, or they'd have my guts for garters.

Security Announcer: Override engaged. Ending security curfew. Sealing security office temporarily.

Lamb: Sinclair died a hero of the Rapture Family. Delta. Was he a friend to you or just a tool? Can you even grasp the difference? And Eleanor... you have chosen Subject Delta over your mother, your people and the duty of your birth. So be it. You believe this craft will carry Delta to safety, like a spoiled child with a new toy. I have no choice but to take it away...

Security Announcer: Curfew lifted. All cell blocks open. All bulkhead seals released.

Eleanor: Oh, no -- mother's turned her attention to the lifeboat -- we must go there, now!

Lamb: Every moment tears Eleanor further from me, Delta. Soon, this father obsession will end her. You have felt me without want... before you die, I will take all that you hold dear. Sinclair is just another body in your wake.

Eleanor: Father, use the Plasmid! I can help!

(Daddy returns to the Docking Platform.)

Eleanor: I was afraid of this, mother has bombed out the ballast compressors, Father. The lifeboat will be too heavy to launch. Unless... let me think... I think I can boat away the water and get the lifeboat to rise, but I can't generate that much heat alone. It's time to recruit the rest at mother's Little Sisters. We're taking them with us. Head to the Pediatric Wards.

(At the Therapy Wing Daddy’s health suddenly gets worse...)

Eleanor: I won't let her take you from me again, Father. Hold on. Mother's people are starting to detonate the charges! We don't have long! We're almost to the Pediatric Word. I expect we'll be lighting our way inside. When you’ve cleared them out, I'll need a signal - - push the call button on the window there, and then I’ll proceed.

(Daddy kills a lot of splicers.)

Eleanor: I'll wake the children up -- they're stronger than they know. With their help I should be able to boat off the water and get us all out of here. Go on ahead, Father. I'll tree them as quickly as I can, just as you showed me.

Lamb: You are not saving them, Delta, no matter how pure your intent. The surface is not paradise but perdition. I would sooner see them drown.

Eleanor: Look, Father. I know you may not have wanted a daughter. But love is just a chemical. We give it meaning by choice. I will be damned if I let mother take you away from me again.

(At the Infirmary.)

Eleanor: That's another charge gone. We have to keep moving - it this building tolls, we're all dead!

Lamb: Eleanor was to be a composite of all Rapture's genius. The first living Utopian, sewing the world at large with no regard to herself... To force consciousness on such a being... Is to tear its wings away. That was your gilt to her Delta... just as she hoped... you must be very proud.

Eleanor: Steady father, don't let go now...

Splicer: (to some corpse) Wake up! Why won't you wake up?! I WILL not lose another patient!

(Diary: They Feel Pain)
Dr. Edward Grimes: One of the children managed to dart past the nurse today and throw herself over the railing in the lobby, not certain if she was trying to end her own life or merely escape. Either way her legs had heated by the time I managed to get down to the first floor where she lay. Without proper setting, the rapid heating process had fused her bones back together at odd angles. We had to re-break and set them almost a dozen times each due to the small window at viability. Those children may be immortal but I can verify that they feel pain. Advising Lamb on higher doses of sedatives to keep this from happening again.

Eleanor: We're nearing another Pediatric Ward. It will be guarded, Father. Get ready. When you've cleared them out I’ll need a signal like before -- push the call button and I'll proceed.

Splicer: Trying to take the children from us!

(Daddy kills a lot of splicers.)

Eleanor: I think... yes, we’re ready for the ballast tank. I can boil off the water and get us out of here. We must return to the Docking Platform, Father. Now.

Lamb: You granted Eleanor the will to choose. And now, like a plague, she spreads it to those innocents. To be self-aware is a curse, Delta... you are damning them.

(Daddy goes back to the Docking Platform.)

Eleanor: I’m stepping inside the ballast tank. Father. Come up to the glass once you‘re ready for me to begin. There's no going back once we start.

(She, along with the rescued Little Sisters goes to the lifeboat.)

Lamb: You would rip my only daughter from her home and family and teed her to a world without hope. Though Utopia may die with her, I would sooner see us fall. Goodbye. Eleanor, mother will be waiting for you.

Eleanor: Here they come, Father! Hold them off until I can bring it to a boil!

(Epic final fight with splicers begins. Daddy uses all his weapons, all his strength to stop them.)

Eleanor: Nearly boiling...

Eleanor: It's boiling! I can help you fight back, now! Use the Plasmid!

(Together they manage to finish off the splicers.)

Eleanor: I've done it Father! The ballast water is gone! Release the docking mechanism!

Eleanor: The elevator to the lifeboat is flooded, Father! We have to equalize the pressure in here or the door won't open! Destroy those glass tubes to flood the room!

(Daddy shoots off the tubes and sea water flooding the room so fast that the screen goes white...)

Eleanor: ...We... we've done it, Father, we're launching! Get to the elevator! The bombs, Father! We're falling! Run!

(They run into a pile of bombs but in the last second Eleanor teleports. Daddy washes off into the open sea… but manages to grab the lifeboat.)

Eleanor: And then Father, the Rapture dream was over. You taught me that evil is just a word; under the skin it’s simple pain. For you, mercy was victory - - you sacrificed you endured, and when given the chance... you forgave. Always. Mother believed this world was irredeemable... but she was wrong. Father, we are Utopia you and I. And in forgiving, we left the door open for her...

(While she speaks these words we see how she gives the sinking Sofia Lamb an oxygen mask… Meanwhile the lifeboat emerges from the sea. Bright light filling the screen. Eleanor takes off the mask from our Daddy. She crosses his hands, injects him with her syringe and takes it off. Daddy appears to be finally dead.)

Eleanor: The Rapture dream is over, but in waking. I am reborn, this world is not ready for me, yet here I am. It would be so easy to misjudge them. You are my conscience, Father… and I need you to guide me. You will always be with me now, Father... your memories your drives. And when I need you, you'll be there on my shoulder, whispering.

(She looks at her reflection in the water. Rescued Little Sisters approach her. They give her the Big Daddy toy, which she throws into the ocean.)

Eleanor: If Utopia is not a place -- but a people, then we must choose carefully. For the world is about to change -- and in our story. Rapture was just the beginning.

THE END
