Warning! Before you read this text, read the original game because the DLC continues its story.

[A man wearing glasses and a leather jacket sits on a park bench. Rose, Ethan's grown-up daughter, approaches him.]

Rose: Hey K, sorry I'm late.

K: That's OK. I'm just enjoying the day.

Rose: You said you had something important to tell me? I hope it's not about Chris wanting me to join his operation, because I already told him that's not happening. I see what he puts you and the rest of his "Hound Wolf Squad" through. No, thank you.

K: It's not about that. It is…about you.

Rose: Me?

K: I…I worry about you. How is um…How are things at school?

Rose: Seriously? That's what you wanted to talk to me about?

K: That group of mean girls still…hassling you?

Rose: You mean are they still treating me like a freak?

K: Hey! Uh-uh! Look at me. You are not a freak.

Rose: I am. You know I am. That's why I keep my distance from everybody at school. If they knew what I really was…

K: So…you don't have any friends that you can talk to?

Rose: Talk to about what? How I'm hardly even human? How I'm some kind of horrendous monster? But hey, it's OK; I hardly ever murder my friends.

K: What if there were a way to get rid of your powers?

[Rose looks at him in surprise.]

Rose: I'd get rid of them in a heartbeat.

K: All right, well, I think there's something I need to show you.

[They go into his lab.]

K: You already know about Miranda and the mutamycete. How she researched it obsessively, and performed experiments on human subjects.

Rose: Like me.

K: Exactly. What you don't know is that we recently found some of her research. Apparently, she discovered a Purifying Crystal that can remove the mutamycete from its host.

Rose: Purifying Crystal?

K: If we can get our hands on one of these, we might be able to weaken or remove your powers entirely.

Rose: Are you kidding me?

K: No, no, but her notes are incomplete. However, I think I have an idea where we can find the rest of her research.

Rose: Then let's do it! Let's find it! Where is it?

[He points to a voluminous container with a red mushroom inside.]

K: In there.

Rose: What?

K: That's a fragment of the Megamycete. It absorbs and stores memories from people who pass away in close proximity. Including Miranda and everything she knows. If you enter its consciousness, you might be able to solve the mystery of the Purifying Crystal.

Rose: Wait, what do you mean enter its consciousness?

K: OK, so, you…Your deep connection will allow you to explore the information within.

Rose: That sounds crazy. You sound crazy.

K: Yes, yes, yes Rose, but not dangerous. Right, think of it just, like, walking through somebody else's memories.

Rose: You really think this can work?

K: I think it's worth trying. What do you have to lose?

Rose: H-How do I even do this?

K: You…Shit, I…I don't know. Try reaching out to it. See what happens.

Rose: OK…Fine. What the hell.

[She brings her hand to the container. The mushrooms inside it begin to glow. Rose plunges into the ocean, which is an allegory for the depths of her consciousness. She hears the voices of people she knows. She floats past the windows behind which the figures stand.]

Girl 1: Oh my god, Rose is so weird.

Girl 2: Yeah, it's like she sees things that aren't there. Creepy. Stay away from us, you freak!

Girl 3: Imagine wanting to be friends with her.

Girl 1: She's definitely not normal.

Girl 2: Eww! Something just moved on her hand!

Girl 1: What is wrong with her?

Rose: Shut up!

[She covers her ears with her hands. The voices keep coming from all directions. Rose sinks deeper and deeper, to the point she can no longer stand the voices.]

Rose: (screams) Please, just stop!

[She comes to her senses sitting on a chair in the lab.]

Rose: I'm still here? K! Where are you? K!

[The lab seems a little different. The light is dimmer.]

Rose: This…isn't right…

[She has the feeling that something has happened here. She walks to the exit and sees a note on the board.]

Miranda's research claims that the Megamycete preserves the memories of people who passed away within its area of influence-absorbing them into its own vast consciousness.
We also know, based on our previous encounters with the mold, that people who are contaminated with the mutamycete are connected in a kind of mold network.
If we extrapolate from this, we can surmise that subjects with a strong affinity to the mutamycete should be able to use the network to connect to the memories of the dead within the Megamycete.
It should be possible to verify this theory using the lab's Megamycete sample we collected 16 years ago; we just need a suitable subject, with a proven connection to the mold.
Unfortunately this presents a problem. Our organization's policies prevent us from directly contacting civilians who are infected with mutamycete. Certainly the ethical reasoning is understandable, but it has rendered the confirmation of this theory impossible.
It pains me to think of how much mankind could stand to benefit from this preservation and indexing of human consciousness.
The possibilities of preserving or even reclaiming great minds! Perhaps there's some way of cutting through the red tape.

[Rose opens the door from the lab and sees…that everything around her is infested with fungus.]

Rose: Wait…What?

[She walks down a corridor whose walls are crooked with time. We realize that she is not walking through the corridors of the laboratory, but through the corridor of an ancient castle with stone walls. She enters the underground dungeon of the castle and enters one of the open cells, where she finds a note.]

I'll be next if I'm not quick.
I need to get that crystal.

[She continues down the corridors, and the walls are covered with a dark red goop that drips disgustingly from them.]

Rose: So gross. What is this?

[From behind a closed cell door, she hears a girl's voice.]

Voice: Let me out.

Rose: I-Is someone there?

Voice: Dangerous here.

Rose: What is? Why? Hang tight. I-I'm going to see if I can find a key.

[Rose goes on in search of the key. She sees an altar on which her name is written in blood, and a candelabra falls on the altar.]

Rose: That's…my name.

[Nearby she finds a note.]

To create art, simply add to the rabbits' carcasses.
Decay is not an issue.
Note: Spruce them up with a bit of makeup, It makes them seem more alive.

[In a closet nearby she manages to find the key, but she stepped in some red goop.]

Rose: OK.

[She notices the goop.]

Rose: Huh?

[The goop tries to take human form, but it fails. All that comes out is a faint voice…]

Voice: Rose…

[The goop's leaking out.]

Rose: What the hell is this stuff!?

[Some goop drips down from the ceiling.]

Rose: Gross. Huh? What was that?

[She goes to the cell and opens the door. There is no one inside except a puddle of red goop. There is a child's drawing on the floor and Rose picks it up.]

Rose: What's this?

[The drawing shows three girls being attacked by something large and black. While she is looking at the drawing, a hand appears out of the red goop and grabs Rose's leg.]

Rose: What the—? No! Stop! Help!

[The goop swallows Rose but someone reaches out and pulls her out.]

Rose: Thanks! Thank you! That was a—

[The girl who rescued her looks like Rose's twin sister, but she has ashy hair. She has black clothes and acts like a real goth, so I'll call her Black Rose.]

Rose: You look just like…me. Who are you?

Black Rose: I'm Rose.

Rose: What's going on here?

Black Rose: Must keep moving.

Rose: But—

Black Rose: Too dangerous here.

[Rose follows her unexpected companion.]

Rose: Wait! Wait up!

[Black Rose approaches the corpse wrapped in a tarpaulin.]

Black Rose: Help me lift.

[Rose helps her push back the corpse, which hides a crack in the stone wall. Black Rose crawls into the crack.]

Rose: Hey! Wait! Where are you going!?

[She follows her. They make their way to the back of the dungeon, lit by many candles. In one of the dungeons, Rose sees another self trying to get out of the goop.]

Rose: What the fuck? There are more and…they all look just like me. Do you know what's happening here? Hey! Are you listening to me?

[She approaches Black Rose trying to use the switch.]

Rose: The switch handle is missing.

Another Rose: Oh, no! It's gone! Need to open the gate.

[Rose continues to follow her double and discovers a small note on the floor.]

"Need to find that handle quickly. Go deeper."

[The cries and moans of her doppelgangers can be heard from everywhere in the different cells. Black Rose disappears somewhere, and Rose has to look for her. Sometimes she discovers her own corpses.]

Rose: So many bodies.

[When she enters one of the small rooms, she is attacked by a barely living double with a twisted face. In disgust and horror, Rose tosses her aside and the doppelganger dies.]

Rose: Did that really—? Oh god.

[She takes the handle out of the broken switch lying in the back room, then tries to find her way back. She hears a scream.]

Rose: What?

[When she arrives at the scream, she sees a pale monster only remotely resembling a human grabbing Black Rose. He sort of sucks part of her face out.]

Black Rose: Rose…help…

[She dies.]

Rose: Oh god!

[The monster runs to Rose.]

Rose: No!

[She falls to the floor and covers her face with her hand, which emits sparks of white light. The sparks throw the monster away, but they don't kill it. Rose can't do the trick again. She runs to the switch and inserts the handle she found.]

Rose: Shit! They're everywhere!

[The door, for some reason, doesn't open right away. Rose has to run from the monster.]

Rose: Come on! Come on, come on!

[Finally, the door opens and Rose runs on, but behind the door there are also many monsters.]

Rose: No way! Oh my god!

[She runs into a round room with a bas-relief of antique soldiers with bows.]

Rose: What!? A dead end?

[The monsters have already caught up with her and are slowly approaching the trapped prey.]

Rose: No! Stay back!

[She presses against a wall that suddenly disappears.]

Rose: What on earth?

[Rose continues to run following the directions of the white sparks that form into words.]

"This way"

Rose: What the—!?

"This way"

[Rose manages to escape the monsters and enter the house itself. It turns out to be Dimitrescu's Castle. Rose climbs out of the fireplace and into the living room. She sits on the floor, trying to process the horror she has experienced.]

"You OK?"

Rose: What…Who? What are you!?

"Not enemy"

Rose: OK…What were those things? What is happening here?

"Leave, now"

Rose: How!? What is this? Where am I?

"Go while you can"

Rose: Not until I get this out of my body. There's a crystal here that will remove the mold. I need to find it. And I'm not leaving until I do.

"Too dangerous"

Rose: Who are you? My guardian angel?

"Sure"

Rose: Do you have a name? If you're an angel, then…Gabriel? Michael?

"Michael"

Rose: OK, "Michael"…What now?

"Dangerous here"

"Move"

[Rose follows the advice and begins to search the house. She finds the corpse of another doppelganger lying on the floor.]

Rose: These poor things.

[She keeps walking and hears a voice coming from afar.]

Voice: You need to run as if your life depends on it! (laugh) …It does.

[Rose enters the main hall and walks up the stairs, still hearing laughter. She arrives at the massive door and sees another of her doppelgangers being dragged by the leg of a monster. He drags her to a fat man in a mask, who is easily recognizable as the Duke.]

Duke: Looks like we caught another. Lively now, aren't you. You should have put that effort into running. It would have made the chase that much more thrilling.

[He touches her face with his fat hand, which against it looks like the hand of a giant.]

Another Black Rose: Let me go! Let me go!

Duke: It would seem this little rabbit lacks the necessary fortitude.

[Several monsters devour it, turning it into a goop.]

Duke: A pity. If you had shown a little grit and actually escaped, that Purifying Crystal would now be yours.

Rose: The crystal!

[Hearing this, she inadvertently opens the door behind which she was standing.]

Duke: Who's this!? (laughs) Oh, now we have a new little rabbit to pursue. Let's see how fast this one is!

[He snaps his fingers.]

Duke: Find her! Hunt her down!

Rose: I gotta get out of here.

[She has to escape again. She finds her way out of the castle.]

Rose: Thank god. A way out!

[However, the iron gate slams shut right in front of her.]

Rose: Shit! What now?

[She runs up the stairs on which the words appear.]

"In danger"

"Need"

"weapon"

"Gun"

Rose: Seriously? Where am I going to get a gun?

[She finds a relatively safe place.]

"Touch my words"

Rose: What? Like this?

[She touches the words and a gun materializes in her hands.]

"Point and shoot"

[Rose kills her pursuer and hears the Duke's voice coming from above.]

Duke: I wonder where I might find the next little rabbit?

Rose: They're gone…This must be the crystal.

[She approaches a statue of four women, one of which is holding a lamp. It shows a scene where three women kill the fourth lying in a field of roses.]

A large crystal is glowing with a pale blue light. There's an indentation where something can be inserted.

[Rose reads the description.]

"The disciples await their masks. Bronze, Silver. Gold. With their garb arrayed, the light shall be released."

Rose: I guess I need to find these masks to unlock it.

[She walks into the dining room and sees a shotgun hidden in a locked cabinet.]

"Grant me that which sees the truth through its three eyes."

[The door further is chained.]

Rose: This needs some kind of other item.

[She finds Bolt Cutters.]

"Over here"

"Should help"

Rose: If you really wanna help, you can back me up against those things.

"I can't"

Rose: What? So I'm on my own? Great.

[Cutting the chain, Rose finds herself in a snow-covered courtyard, in the center of which she sees a masked statue that is encircled by a red flower.]

Rose: How…

"Mask trapped"

"Break core"

Rose: "Core"? You mean that gross lumpy thing? How am I supposed to break it?

"Use your powers"

Rose: My powers? I literally came here to get rid of them.

"Only way"

Rose: OK fine, but how? What am I supposed to do?

"Need amplifier"

Rose: What's that?

"Keep going. Through door"

[Rose continues her journey and once again enters the house where she finds a rather creepy door with three eyes.]

Rose: It's locked.

[She goes up to the second floor, where some of the passages are filled with red goop. When she tries to step on them, they begin to suck Rose in.]

Rose: I'd better not touch that stuff.

[She has to fight several monsters again. She also finds another flower.]

Rose: There's a gross lumpy thing growing here.

[Soon she stumbles upon a large amount of goop blocking the passage.]

Rose: No way I'm wading through that. Maybe I can find a way across.

[She climbs up the improvised rafters and throws down a ladder to help her get to the other side. After wandering around the dilapidated castle, Rose reaches the attic where she finds the RW-Variant Flask 1.]

Rose: So what am I supposed to do with this thing?

"Focus"

Rose: Focus? All right…I feel…different somehow.

"Use on core"

Rose: All right, let's see if this works.

[She finds another note.]

I have found a means of dramatically destabilizing parts of the mutamycete network by introducing a disruptive force to block the autoinducers they use for communication.
For example, the hard-packed cores of mold known as sclerotia begin to break down on a cellular level and disintegrate when thus disrupted.
Sclerotia form when the mutamycete develops in new locations, serving as a sort of anchor point or foothold. They are often associated with a patch of liquid void through which the mold has spread.
When the autoinducers of the sclerotia are disrupted, it begins to break down. Any liquid void connected to the sclerotia will also disintegrate.
It would appear that destabilizing the sclerotia sends a signal indicating that location is no longer viable for mutamycete habitation, triggering a full-scale retreat.

[Rose approaches the nearest flower.]

"Focus here"

[The white light emanating from her hands dries the flower. It crumbles into dust.]

Rose: Oh!

[Now the red goop is no longer a serious obstacle for her. She has been given the opportunity to fight. Destroying the flowers in her path she returns to the statue.]

Rose: If I can't get around it, I need to get rid of it. It's like I can't quite get a grip!

[Not far from her on the floor, she finds a picture in the next statue wearing a mask.]

"Monocular door, deep in the basement."

[She destroys the flower holding the statue and gets a bronze mask.]

Rose: I finally got it.

[Rose returns to the house.]

"Rest"

"What's wrong?"

Rose: Everything! None of this was supposed to happen.

"Why not leave?"

Rose: No. The reason I came here hasn't changed. I need that crystal.

"Here"

Rose: Thank you.

[She destroys the flower blocking the door and continues to explore the castle. She finds a diary, apparently belonging to the Duke.]

I do not recall a single thing. Not who I am, nor how I came to be. I know nothing.
My memories are as broken as the face hide behind this mask.
All that remains is this feeling, this hunger, to see others in pain. The despair in their eyes, the sounds of their screams…
Who will be my next quarry? I have my minion to do my bidding. He has many faces but no brains within those skulls. He is my best hound and he will chase those rabbits down.

[After destroying another flower, Rose finds a small back room.]

"Safe here"

"Tired?"

Rose: I'm fine, but what about you?

"Weak here"

Rose: Is that why your words are fading?

"Yes"

Rose: Try not to overdo it, then.

[She continues her journey and enters a small room with pictures of different animals arranged around it.]

"The predators stand united, each staring down their prey."

[She tries to take away the puzzle of the paintings but fails because there are not enough paintings. Soon she is surrounded again. She hears the Duke's voice coming from the speakers.]

Duke: My word. You're just full of surprises, aren't you?

Rose: Shit!

[The Duke is setting his monsters on her.]

Duke: But I think you'll find that this strapping brute is made of sterner stuff.

"This way"

[Rose runs into the room to which Michael pointed.]

Rose: Those things chased me in here…But where is it? The Monocular Key was supposed to be here somewhere. It's not in this room though. It must be close by.

"Don't go. Too weak"

"Behind fireplace"

[Rose climbs into the fireplace and discovers a secret passage there.]

"Take this"

[Rose picks up RW-Variant Flask 2.]

Rose: Looks like there are more of these.

"Stronger now"

"Focus on enemy"

Rose: That was me. I did that!

[The white energy stops the monsters from moving. They practically freeze while Rose directs her power at them.]

"Focus on enemy"

[With a flash of white energy she repels the monster which allows her to have more time to shoot.]

"This too"

[Rose picks up a Sprig of White Sage. This plant restores her fungal powers.]

"Be careful"

[Rose continues her journey and soon finds the Monocular Key and the diary next to it.]

As previously discussed, disrupting the autoinducers within a mutamycete network can have destabilizing effects on the mold.
These effects can also be observed in beings formed of mold. Rather than the cellular disintegration observed in sclerotia, however, this instead presents as a dramatic slowing of movement, practically freezing the being in place.
If other bodies are in close proximity to the target, this disruption effect can spread, but only within a very limited sphere of influence.

[Rose runs to the basement door.]

"Stay safe"

Rose: I'm trying, but it's hard when I'm being hunted by a demented giant and his creepy minions.

"Run"

Rose: Yeah, I guess I can't fight them all.

[She opens the cellar door with one eye on it and hears the Duke's voice.]

Duke: You're quite the tricksy little rabbit to have made it this far. The next mask, however, won't be nearly as easy to get your grubby paws on.

[She hears something growling.]

Rise: What's that sound?

[Going further, she finds a note.]

Welcome to The Gallery of Despair!
A wondrous display of those few who succeeded in obtaining at least one mask.
Set your sights upon those chosen few, whose final moments of despair are preserved forever in this gallery.
Witness in this collection the light of life from a different perspective.

Rose: That sick bastard.

[She solves a riddle with moving pedestals on which the mutilated corpses of her doppelgangers are placed. The riddle opens a door in the floor where the pool of blood used to be. Rose reads the inscription under the painting.]

"Although I have just drowned, the arrows' bite doth sting. They hanged me long ago, yet I feel everything. But still the worst, not last nor first, the sharpened blade did ring."

[Rose goes down into the dark cellar. She finds another piece of paper lying on the floor next to the mutilated corpse of her double.]

"The silver mask is in the small room in the back. I'm so close…"

[Rose walks on and finds herself in a wine cellar, where a huge multifaced monster with a sledgehammer slowly walks by. Rose hides in the shadows, trying not to attract his attention. In the depths of the cellar she finds a statue with a silver mask on it. She also finds a pipe bomb.]

Rose: Two masks down, one to go.

Duke: You've put your filthy mitts on something you shouldn't have. I think it's time to teach this greedy little rabbit a lesson.
[Rose begins to be chased by red goop and monsters again. As she escapes, she blows a bomb through them and escapes, exiting the door of the blood pool. She enters a small room.]

"The mask?"

Rose: I got it, but just barely. This ugly brute turned up.

"Don't fight, run"

Rose: No shit! I can't fight something like that.

"Take this"

Rose: I'll take all the help I can get.

[Michael hands her some ammunition and weed. After searching the room, Rose discovers a lost snake painting and a note apparently left by one of her doppelgangers.]

Shotgun Shells: Gunpowder + rusted scrap
Pipe Bombs:
Gunpowder + rusted scrap + herbs (I saw a shotgun in the dining room.)
These should help me escape.

[Rose goes out to the courtyard.]

Duke: Persistent little rabbit, aren't you? But you cannot simply do as you please.

[He unleashes the ugly monster with a spiky sledgehammer from the basement.]

Rose: This guy again!?

[She escapes from the monster and enters the room with the paintings. After placing them in the right order, she opens the lock and gains access to the chest behind it.]

Rose: Did he make these puzzles to mess with me?

[In the chest she finds the Triocular Key, a key with three eyes.]

"The Triocular Emblem begets glory. Unto thee the golden mask shall be granted."

[With this key she gains access to the shotgun from the dining room.]

Rose: This should make things easier.

[She opens a door with three eyes and, after defeating several monsters, finds a golden mask.]

Rose: Easy-peasy.

[Her right arm is starting to hurt…]

Rose: What now?

[While she was distracted, the monster with a sledgehammer sneaks up on her and takes her away. She ends up in a prison cell.]

Rose: Where am I?

[The Duke speaks to her through the television, which shows his emblem-mask with four eyes and a crown.]

Duke: Rise and shine, little one! What a shame. You were but a hop, a skip, and a jump away from claiming your crystalline prize. I knew the real Rose would be so much more lively. It would be a shame to snuff you out so unceremoniously. Shall we prolong our fun a little longer? Oh, come now, don't pout. I've prepared a nice little diversion for you. 

[Two dozen flowers appear next to Rose.]

Duke: So many sclerotia, nearly all of them are counterfeit. Do you think you can suss out the real ones? Time is running out, little one. Tick tock, tick tock.

[The rose begins to destroy the flowers one by one.]

Duke: You'll be swallowed right up if you don't hurry.

Rose: How am I supposed to tell the difference?

"Stay calm"

"I'll help"

Duke: Whoopsie. You need a more discerning eye, my dear. Only two minutes left! No time for lollygagging!

"Lower than barrel"

"Right"

Duke: You're not even close!

"Left"

Rose: Yes!

"Nice work"

"Next one"

Duke: My, my, look at the time. Just 90 seconds left.

"Deep shadow"

"Broken wall"

"Big core"

[The Duke releases his monsters.]

Duke: You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?

Rose: Now!? Seriously?

Duke: Only one minute to go! Better pick up the pace!

Rose: Still not done?

Duke: Are you ready for the grand finale!?

"Hurry"

Rose: What!?

"Follow my words"

"Here"

"Up"

Duke: It's not a good idea to take any chances. (laughs) 30 seconds. Time's a-wasting!

"Further"

"Center"

Rose: Please be the last one. Thank god that's over.

[She escapes from prison.]

"You did it!"

Rose: I couldn't have done it without you!

"All you"

[He hands her some ammunition as a gift.]

Rose: I was hoping for a pony, but I guess this'll do.

"Almost time"

Rose: Yeah. I can finally get rid of these powers. But I have to admit, I lived with them for so long, it's kind of weird to let them go.

"Be careful"

Rose: I know, I know…

[She approaches the statues and places all three masks on their faces. Above its heads, three lamps light up in blue. Rose takes the Crystal and hears laughter. A laughing fat man appears right at her back.]

Duke: Well done, little one. You've more than earned this reward. Almost looks like the real thing, doesn't it?

[The crystal crumbles in Rose's hands.]

Rose: What!?

Duke: It's a replica, of course. Nothing that valuable could ever manifest on this stratum. Did you really think I'd give away something so precious?

[He snaps his fingers.]

Duke: I had to bait the trap with something.

[Rose is sucked in by the red goop.]

Rose: No! No! NO!

[The Duke laughs watching her torment. Rose comes to her senses in the catacombs. She looks at the installation of four corpses tied to wooden sticks connected together. The Duke sits above her.]

Duke: Now comes the real fun! The perfect place for your demise. (laughs);Let the show begin!

[The monster with a spiky sledgehammer enters the room.]

Rose: You're kidding! I have to fight him!?

[She attacks the monster and its weak spot opens up, glowing with a white light. Rose shoots at it, dealing damage.]

Rose: Oh shit, he's even uglier now.

Duke: Now that's entertainment! (laughs)

[The monster falls to the stone floor.]

Rose: Is he dead? Did I do it?

Duke: Well, look at you! So much feistier than those other little rabbits! This is becoming tedious! Time to shake things up!

[He unleashes some of the usual monsters into the arena. And on top of that the monster with a sledgehammer gets on his feet…]

Rose: He's not dead!?

Duke: I admire your tenacity, little rabbit. Futile as it may be.

Rose: Gotta find a way to do some real damage.

Duke: This is the most insipid fight I've ever seen! Don't let her get away with that! You call this a show!?

[Michael comes to Rose's rescue.]

"Take this. Hurry"

[She picks up RW-Variant Flask 3.]

[Rose uses her powers to attack the monster's weak spots.]

Duke: Enough with the dillydallying. Finish this!

[Rose wins again. This makes the Duke very angry.]

Duke: Useless creature! Such a disappointment! No matter. Your imminent demise……is inevitable.

[He snaps his fingers and puddles of red goop appear around Rose.]

"RUN!"

Rose: Where?

"Here!"

[He points her to the edge of the cliff.]

Rose: What? Down there!?

"Jump!"

[Rose jumps into the water and plunges back into the depths seeing windows around her with figures in them. She comes to her senses outside on a snow covered road.]

Rose: Where am I now?

"A deeper stratum."

Rose: Stratum?

"Yes"

"Deeper you go, harder to escape."

"Need to leave while you can."

Rose: I don't want to leave. Not until I find that crystal. I'm tired of being a freak. I want to have friends. I want to live a normal life……without this…curse. If that Purifying Crystal can make that happen…Make me normal…Then I'm not going back until I find it.

"Stubborn."

Rose: Yeah. So?

"So…let's get searching."

Rose: All right then.

[She enters the gate and walks down a long, creepy alley of dried out plants, bare trees with rusty metal fences. Soon she bumps into a toy monkey with a note in his hands.]

"I know where the crystal is."

Rose: What's this?

[The next note runs in an empty baby stroller rolling down the road.]

"Will you be my friend?"

[The third note is written on the tombstone.]

"Let's play"

Rose: I swear I've seen these monkeys before but…what the hell?

[She enters the building and takes the elevator.]

"Something's not right."

Rose: What's wrong?

"Someone's trying to block me."

Rose: OK?

[The light in the elevator shuts off abruptly.]

Rose: Wh-What?

[The elevator changes in seconds!]

Rose: Something seems different.

[She gets out of the elevator and sees two huge stuffed monkeys at the entrance and the sign above the door made with inflatable letters "Welcome Rose".]

Rose: OK, this is weird.

[She begins to investigate the room in which she finds a strange diary.]

January 5
Today was my first day of school! I've always wanted to go! I'm gonna give Chris a big hug next time I see him.
There were so many kids my age. It was like I walked into a TV show or something. I was so scared when I had to introduce myself to the class, but I was still super duper excited to be there.
I'm going to make so many friends! I'm gonna try and talk to them tomorrow.

January 8
I tried to be brave and talk to some other kids but no one wants to talk to me.
School work is super easy. It's all stuff I learned with Mommy. But I guess I shouldn't answer all the teacher's questions? (The boy behind me said something really mean…)
My hands go icky with white sweat when I panic. It was really bad today.

February 10
Today the teacher yelled at me for always carrying my hanky. She says I'm not a baby anymore.
The boys at school keep saying I'm icky, but I take a bath every night, always wear clean clothes, and bring a fresh hanky every day!
It's because of the stupid white sweat. Whenever it starts coming out of my hands I wipe it off right away. But sometimes it won't wipe off, so I just hold my hanky really tight.
Chris even told the teacher it can't get anyone sick, but it didn't change anything!

April 4
Someone finally talked to me! Lucy from my class said she always wanted to be friends! We're going to have lunch together tomorrow.
I can't believe it! I'm so happy!
I hope Lucy's friend Catherine will be my friend too.

Rose: This is—!

[She continues down the corridors with peeling whitewash.]

Rose: Why is there a picture of me?

[She walks into a room filled with plush monkeys! On the table is a cake with three candles and a cage with the Crystal glittering in it.]

Rose: The crystal's right, but there's no way to get it.

[Suddenly the light in the room goes out.]

Child Voice: It's playtime! You don't need that junk!

[When the lights come back on, the room changes. The toy monkey lies in front of the rose like a patient on the operating table. The whole room basically resembles a hospital. Rose discovers that her belongings are missing.]

Rose: Hey! My stuff!

[She's looking at the toy monkey with her tummy stitched up.]

Rose: His stomach has been stitched up. It looks like there's something inside.

[She begins to explore the house in search of something sharp. Soon she finds a child's drawing with an inscription on it.]

"The stuffed locker, the picture on the bookshelf, the desk covered in stuff."

[Rose opens the combination lock with a drawing and takes the scissors from the closet. When she returns to the plush monkey in the hallway there are doll arms hanging from the ceiling.]

Rose: What the hell?

[Rose opens the plush monkey and pulls out the Relief of a Child statuette.]

Child Voice: "Ow! That hurt!" You won't get the crystal by slicing open your friends.

[A red goop starts flowing out of the monkey and the lights go off again.]

Child Voice: Uhh…You know how to play with dolls, don't you?

[The room changes again.]

Rose: Again? What now!?

[She reads the note lying next to the diorama that appeared. It depicts the burning of a witch in the woods by three girls.]

"Maybe you'll get the crystal once you get the campfire started?"

[Rose picks up a doll named Lucy.]

"I bet you can find all kinds of places to play with this doll and her friends."

[Rose sets out again on her quest.]

Rose: So you want me to play with dolls?

[She finds another table with a diorama, this time a bathroom scene.]

"Catherine"

"We need to clean that gross mold off of her!"

[Need another doll!]

Rose: Someone really went all out…

[She finds a door with a bas-relief of the mother and inserts a baby figure into it. In the room he finds a doll…and another diorama table, a gift scene. The voice laughs at her.]

Rose: The label's completely illegible.

[Rose uses the found kitchens on Table 2 - the bathroom scene - and gets Jimmy's Room Key. The diorama represents a small episode in Rose's life when she was humiliated in the bathroom.]

Rose: Yeah, yeah, I get it. Fuck you.

[She goes to Jimmy's room, which turns out to be a creepy basement with a well, and finds a third doll there.]

Rose: God, this is so creepy.

[A mannequin that appears out of nowhere scares Rose.]

Rose: No way.

[She goes to the third table-the gift scene-and arranges the dolls. It's a little scene from Rose's life again. The box that opens rewards Rose with a new doll.]

Rose: What the—!?

[She goes to the first table-the scene of the burning of the witch in the woods-and arranges the dolls.]

Rose: Seriously, fuck you.

[Rose gets the Breaker Box Key.]

Child Voice: Aww, she's dead. So sad.

[The lights go off again and the scene changes. A telephone appears in front of Rose and begins to ring.]

Child Voice: Jeez, Rose, you're still looking for the crystal? Fine. I'll help you out. Just take the elevator to me. Mommy might be upset that I'm helping you though…

Rose: Who are you!?

[However, the voice on the other end of the phone hangs up and Rose has no choice but to go to the elevator.]

"Let's play Statues"

"It's game over if they catch you."

"Don't look away."

[Mannequins with scary glowing eyes start chasing Rose and only move when you're not looking at them.]

Child Voice: Don't let Mommy catch you.

Rose: Jesus Christ.

"Don't look away."

[Creepy mannequins begin to follow Rose everywhere. Each time, there are more and more of them. Finally, Rose enters the elevator. She presses the button several times, but the doors don't close.]

Rose: Why won't this thing work?

[She hears the child's laughter again. The elevator begins to move downward.]

Rose: Why are you doing this?

Child Voice: You're after the crystal, aren't you?

Rose: Do you know where it is?

Child Voice: I've gathered some "friends" just for you. Entertain them and maybe I'll tell!

[Rose walks out into the room…with huge dolls. Now she herself is the size of a doll.]

Rose: What is going on here?

Voice: Poor little Rose. I'm waiting for you in the back bedroom.

"Let's play hide-and-seek! Can you make it all the way here without getting caught?"

[Several dolls with knives and sickles were passing by Rose.]

Voice: Oh look, your friends want to play hide-and-seek. Think you can evade them on your way here?

Rose: I can't let them see me. I guess I should keep heading this way?

Child Voice: (laughs) Wherever could little Rose be?

[Rose cautiously sneaks past the armed dolls without letting themselves be discovered.]

Child Voice: Ugh, you're so stubborn. Well, there are still plenty of friends waiting. Did you hear that? Get her!

Rose: So many…If they see me, I'm toast. There's got to be something I can do. I just have to get past them.

Child Voice: Had enough?

[Rose continues to hide.]

Child Voice: You know what happens to little girls who can't play nice, don't you? They get punished.

Rose: No way. I think the bedroom is just over there.

Child Voice: Where have you hidden yourself? Found you!

[Rose runs into the bedroom and finds herself with several giant dolls who sort of play with her.]

Doll 1: No one likes Rose.

Doll 2: Because she's a freak.

Rose: Hey!

Doll 1: She has those creepy powers.

Rose: What?

Doll 2: Just like her dad.

Doll 1: That's why she doesn't have any friends.

Rose: Shut up!

Doll 1: You know it's true!

Doll 2: What is wrong with her?

Doll 1: She's afraid! Look at her!

Rose: No!

Doll 2: Afraid of what she might turn into!

Rose: Shut up! Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!

[But the dolls only laugh at her. She runs out of the room chased by a mannequin and closes the huge door.]

Rose: I gotta get out of here!

[She's running away from the huge doll heads.]

Doll 1: So you're the girl without any friends.

Rose: Leave me alone!

Doll 2: You should be nice to your friends. Rose is so disgusting.

Rose: Shut up!

Doll 1: Everyone hates Rose.

Rose: Stop it!

Doll 2: Rose has no friends.

Rose: Stop it!

Doll 1: It's all because of her dad.

Rose: Just shut up!

"I finally found you! Let's go!"

Rose: Michael!

[She leaves the creepy world of dolls, returning to the normal world with monsters.]

Rose: I can't take much more of this…Why are they talking about my dad!? I never even met him!

"Do you…resent him?"

Rose: No…I don't know. I don't know the first thing about him. I wish I did. All I know is…he died protecting me. Sometimes I try to imagine what my life would have been like if he hadn't died. Would he have taught me to ride a bike? Helped me with my homework? Read me a story every night? Would he have been there for me? Proud of me? Sometimes when I feel lost or afraid…I try to imagine what he might have said to me.

"Come."

"I have something you should see."

[Michael teleports her to Ethan and Mia's house from the beginning of the original game.]

Rose: Where are we?

"You're safe here."

Rose: It feels familiar. Like I've been here before. Look at all the decorations…Some kind of party?

[She finds a little note by the couch.]

To do:
- Decorate the living room. (Done!)
- Get wine, put in dining room. (Yep!)
- Rose's other present in study. (Hidden!)

"Don't forget to look upstairs."

Rose: Upstairs? I'll take a look.

[She examines the family photo next to the kitchen.]

Ethan: I'm so lucky to have you both in my life.

Rose: What's that voice? Is that…Dad? This must be my parents' house from when I was a baby. I bet other things also have my dad's memories.

Ethan: She's so little. Hard to believe one day she'll be old enough to share a bottle of wine with her old man.

[Rose inspects bottles of Regina Rosie wine from Crama Barbaneagra (the name of the winery). The wine is obviously Romanian.]

Rose: So Dad was a wine drinker.

[She examines a CD of songs by Miss D & The Pallboys.]

Ethan: She bangs her spoon every time I play this. Wonder if she'll be a musician?

Rose: I wonder if Dad played any instruments?

[She examines her bottle of baby formula.]

Ethan: She just can not get enough of this stuff.

Rose: I bet Dad would feed me as soon as I started crying.

"Take your time and look around."

[Rose goes into the closet and examines the jars of baby food.]

Ethan: Rose is such a picky eater. All she ever wants is fruit puree.

Rose: I guess I've always loved fruit.

"Don't forget to look upstairs."

[Rose goes up to the second floor. She starts up the music box.]

Ethan: This tune has always been special for our family.

Rose: I think I've heard this before. It's pretty.

[She goes into her parents' room on the second floor.]

Rose: This is…my bedroom?

[She examines her crib.]

Ethan: She's growing so fast. Getting bigger every day.

Rose: This crib is so little.

Ethan: She's already growing out of these onesies?

Rose: I can't believe I was ever this tiny.

[She goes into the next room where Ethan's office was located. She turns on his computer.]

February 2 is Rose's half birthday! Half a year in the blink of an eye…
I wanted to capture this moment, these feelings, so I wrote something special. I may have gotten a bit sappy though…
I'd feel embarrassed if anyone stumbles across it, so it's safe in the sideboard for now. The key is behind my favorite photo.

[She examines her childhood photo.]

Ethan: I wonder if she'll look like me when she grows up.

Rose: I looked so happy.

[She picks up the Drawer Key from behind the photo.]

Rose: A letter for me?

[She reads the letter.]

Ethan: Happy half-birthday Rose! My gift to you is a promise. I'll always be there for you. No matter what. I'll be there every birthday to watch your blow out the candles on your cake. I'll be there to make you breakfast and walk you to school every day. I'll be there when you have a bad dream and sing to you until you fall back asleep. I'll hug you tight when you're troubled or worried and tell you that everything's going to be all right. You are my precious Rose. Never forget that. Dad.

[She wipes away her tears as she reads the letter. At that moment, a little girl dressed in black comes in. She is the one who has been leading Rose the whole time. Her face seems familiar…]

Eveline: No one loves you.

[Rose begins to get sucked in by the red goop.]

Rose: No! No! Michael? Michael, help! Michael! No!

Eveline: Guess what? That thing you're looking for? Isn't here.

[Rose goes back to the house with the dolls.]

Rose: So…you don't have the Purifying Crystal?

Eveline: Of course not. For that, you'll have to go deeper. …Much deeper. Poor Rose. She can't trust anyone.

Rose: Why are you doing this!?

Eveline: No one loves you! And when you're dead, no one will care! Enough games. Now you'll drown. I came first.

Rose: First?

[She goes after Everline trying to avoid the red goop.]

Eveline: Why does she only want you? What are you talking about? Look at you! You are beyond worthless!

Rose: Seriously, what is your problem!?

Eveline: You're just so greedy. 

[Dolls with sickles appear in front of Rose's face and begin to inflict small cuts on her until she waves them away.]

Eveline: So many friends and it's never enough! Where do you think you're going? Oh look, your family's here.

Rose: Enough of this shit!

[She fights crowds of mannequins using her powers.]

Eveline: Die. Die!

[Rose runs up to the elevator and Eveline appears in front of her.]

Eveline: This should have been my chance. They were supposed to die and join me here!

[She grabs Rose's hand.]

Rose: Let go!

[Suddenly Eveline is enveloped in a white glow. It's Michael.]

Eveline: What? Stop it! How are you even here!? How are you even here!?

[He teleports Eveline away. Rose runs into the elevator.]

"Hurry."

Rose: Michael! Good, you made it out!

"Be careful."

"We're not safe yet."

"Eveline's causing this."

Rose: Eveline? That little girl?

"We still can't get out."

"Use your powers on her."

"I can help once she's weak."

"These should help."

[He hands Rose several bottles of healing fluid and RW-Variant Flask 4.]

"Don't panic. You've got this."

Eveline: You will never leave! Never!

[Rose hides behind an overturned table not far from Eveline.]



"Watch out for her wind blasts."

"This way."

"Wait for an opening."

Eveline: I have been such a good girl.

"Now! Use your powers!"

[Rose attacks Eveline with her fungal powers!]

"She's not done. Be careful."

Eveline: When they died, we were supposed to be a family! But they're completely obsessed with stupid old Rose. You'll die here!

"Watch your step!"

Eveline: If you'd never been born, it would have been perfect.

[Rose continues to attack Eveline by hiding behind overturned furniture. Eveline takes off and more and more transforms the environment into a real fungal hell.]

Eveline: This is stupid! Go away! I was special! You're worthless! No escape! You're worthless! Nothing! A-A freak with no friends!

"You have me."

"Over here."

"Keep focusing. I'll help."

Eveline: You're nothing! No! Stop! 

[She grabs her head and explodes with a white glow. After that, the house returns to normal. Eveline sits on the floor and cries. Rose slowly walks up to her.]

Eveline: I can't believe how useless I am. No wonder no one loves me.

Rose: What now…?

Eveline: (screams) Back off!

[A gust of wind knocks Rose off her feet.]

Eveline: (angerly) This is all your fault! And I will never let you have what you want!

[Suddenly, for a split second, in a burst of white sparks, Ethan appears on the screen and pushes Rose into the abyss through the door.]

Ethan: Rose! Look out! Don't give up, Rose! Find that crystal.

[Rose sinks back into the water, floating past the windows. She finds herself outside again.]

Rose: Michael? Are you there?

Ethan: (in Rose’s memories) Rose! Look out!

Rose: He…He saved me. But he didn't make it…That voice…My dad's voice. Is Michael…my dad?

Ethan: (in Rose’s memories) Don't give up, Rose! Find that crystal.

Rose: Because of him…I can keep going. I have to find that crystal. I'm on my own, but I have to keep going.

[She walks past furniture lying in the snow and a door with three eyes.]

Rose: What's all this doing out here?

[It overlooks a communal area with a castle in the distance. There are bubbles of goop hanging in the sky, from which it drips down in a trickle.]

Rose: Where the hell am I? What is this place? What is that? I can sense…something from over there.

[She notices…herself in the distance. Crows fly into the air and the figure leaves.]

Rose: Wh-What?

[She follows the figure through the burning village.]

Rose: They're all…me. Just like in the castle.

[It attacks its monstrous clones with fungal powers.]

Rose: I'm even stronger than before! I don't have time for this! I need to find that crystal. 

[After breaking through her monstrous copies, she jumps into a cave where she finds a creepy creature remotely resembling a heart. The creature spits out copies of Rose.]

Rose: Is this where those copies of me came from?

[She jumps to her heart's content and enters Miranda's lab and reads the diary lying on the table.]

The Megamycete absorbs the memories of all life within its reach, but there are laws which govern this world within it. It seems worthwhile to catalogue them as they become apparent.
1. The "memories" that comprise this realm do not strictly reflect reality.
2. Only those who are attuned to the mutamycete in life retain control of their faculties here in this realm.
This aligns with my understanding of the Megamycete as revealed to me in its visions before my death.
Yes. My death. My physical body is gone, absorbed into the Megamycete. And yet I do not despair, for this fate has granted me fascinating insights. All those years I strived, have continued to strive, they are not for nothing.
The memories, the consciousness, understanding, and knowledge I accumulated in life have transferred here to the Megamycete, where it serves as a source of power within this realm. If I can harness this power, I believe I can use it to affect the thoughts and memories of others.
Of course, it's hardly a perfect arrangement. With so many minds and memories gathered here, finding and retrieving a single person from amidst the rabble has proven an immense challenge.
 memories are here, yes, but dissolute.
Perhaps what is needed is the right vessel into which to hold her.
And of course, I know of the perfect vessel, the only real candidate in all my years of searching: Rosemary Winters.

Rose: Someone's been here.

I have been experimenting with the possibilities of manipulating and reviving the consciousnesses stored within the Megamycete.
When a person dies, their consciousness is stored and preserved, but over time it becomes diffused and diluted, spread thin throughout the Megamycete and mixed with other consciousnesses and memories.
Extracting and reassembling an individual who has thus diffused has proved a monumental effort.
As an experiment I decided to see what would happen if I used different individuals' consciousnesses to create an entity.
Results:
The results were fascinating. I gathered fragments, re-spooled the threads, and succeeded in creating an individual, birthed anew in this realm.
A success, to be sure, but while his unusual physique resembled a man I once knew, he was possessed of a deeply warped psyche and was missing a portion of his face.
Conclusion:
While manipulating memories to create a person is possible, the creations are flawed and unstable. It will not be possible to manufacture a suitable vessel in this way.

Rose: Who wrote all this?

I had intended to duplicate Rosemary Winters, with the hope that a perfect replica might serve as a suitable vessel. However, the results were less than ideal.
It would seem that some sort of interference is preventing me from creating a suitable replica.
Instead I have succeeded in making what is, essentially, a living doll. It resembles the real thing, yes, but has no power. Such a pathetic husk could never prove suitable as a vessel.
I will continue my efforts in hopes of discerning the source of this interference. Several hypotheses have come to mind thus far:
1. The fact that Rose herself is still alive. 
2. Some other actor within this realm. 
3. A flaw in my methods of production.
None of these seem especially likely to be the sole reason, nor are any of them easy problems to solve.
Perhaps my best hope is to somehow bring Rose into this realm. Were she to offer herself as a vessel it would be so simple.
Additional observations:
Further experiments with these Rose Copies (as I've taken to calling these husks) have yielded another interesting wrinkle to pursue.
When subjected to situations evoking extreme terror, they actually begin to express some semblance of Rose's abilities.
This warrants more research, and I think that my first creation, the Masked Duke, is just the one to perform this "stress test."

Rose: They couldn't have been watching me the entire time…could they?

It would seem that at some point during my experiments with consciousnesses, an intruder made herself at home in my realm.
This intruder was none other than the failure, Eveline, who has been running about enacting her own pitiful agenda, which has led to a slight disruption in my own plans.
Had Eveline not interfered, Rosemary Winters would have been on the verge of despair, dispossessed of her will to live and her mutamycete powers. Instead, a new passion burns within her. I shall have to extinguish it.

[Rose checks her weapons and goes deep into the cave.]

Rose: There's that feeling again. It's so strong. It must be the crystal.

[Along the way, Rose finds a piece of paper.]

That pull I've been feeling is close, but I just can't go any further.
I thought I had made it when I saw that blue light, but no, not quite.
If only I'd been braver. Faster. Stronger. So close. I was so close.

Rose: I'm almost there, Michael. It's through here.

[She approaches the altar and reads the book placed on it.]

Black God, which lives in us and in which we live.
Create for us a new world, as befits your will.
Your dark consciousness holds for us a second chance, graciously offered and joyously accepted.
You drink the blood of the lost lamb as it falls upon your darkened earth. Not to destroy, but to preserve, and once again deliver unto life.

Rose: This is some twisted shit.

[She goes to Crystal, lying on a post nearby.]

Rose: This one's the real deal. I can feel it.

[She touches the Crystal and the white veins in her arms disappear.]

Rose: It's working! Oh my god…Is this what normal feels like?

[In front of the post, Miranda appears laughing out of the red goop, spreading her black wings.]

Miranda: Rose! I've waited so long for you!

Rose: Who…Who are you?

Miranda: My name is Miranda.

Rose: What?

[She slowly hides the Crystal behind her back.]

Miranda: You had become so powerful, far too powerful for me to subdue directly. So I had to lure you into this realm, so that you might willingly relinquish your powers.

Rose: No, but K said…

Miranda: Did he? Or did I?

[A flashback shows us that Rose was sitting alone on that bench at the beginning of the game.]

Miranda: That K was an illusion. Very convincing, wouldn't you say?

Rose: No way…

Miranda: Now you can become the vessel for my Eva!

[Tentacles made of goop emerge from the ground. Miranda transforms into her battle form. Suddenly Ethan appears and covers Rose with himself.]

Ethan: Rose! Run!

Transformed Miranda: Ethan! You pest!

Ethan:  Go!

Transformed Miranda: So at this stratum even he can manifest. He can't save you, Rose! No one can!

[She rushes after Rose and the materialized Ethan. Ethan runs ahead and uses the shotgun to blast away the monsters.]

Ethan: Rose! Rose, hurry!

Transformed Miranda: You can't escape! Not from me!

Rose: Dad! Wait, hold up. Is it really you?

Ethan: Yes but right now you need to run! Run! Rose!

[The passage begins to crumble. Ethan helps Rose avoid the collapse. They pull away from Miranda for a while.]

Rose: Thanks. Why didn't you tell me who you really were? Why'd you let me call you Michael?

Ethan: I didn't want to complicate things. I just needed you safe.

[They keep running.]

Ethan: And I'm sorry I left you alone, but I had to find a way out. And I did. It's just ahead.

[They run to the exit of the cave. Suddenly Miranda catches up with them and grabs Rose.]

Transformed Miranda: Rose! You are mine now.

[Ethan shoots Miranda with a shotgun right in the head.]

Ethan: (screams) Get away from my daughter! Stay away from my family! Rose! Come on!

[They run out of the cave, but Miranda continues the pursuit and grabs Rose again.]

Transformed Miranda: You cannot escape me, Rose!

[Ethan covers his daughter with himself again.]

Transformed Miranda: Ethan! Persistent as always.

Rose: Dad!

[He fights Miranda.]

Ethan: Rose, now's your chance. Go live a normal life. Make friends. No one will ever call you a freak again.

Rose: But—

Ethan: Rose, just go!

Rose: I don't want to leave you!

Ethan: I know! I know, I love you…But I need to know that you're safe…So please just—

Transformed Miranda: Ethan! You insolent pest!

Ethan: I’ve got this! Get out of here!

[Rose was about to run away, but Miranda stabs Ethan with her tentacle and Rose stops. She gathers her will, turns around, and with a scream smashes the Crystal into the frozen ground, regaining her strength.]

Rose:  Don't worry, Dad. I've got this.

[The epic battle begins!]

Transformed Miranda: You think your powers will allow you to stand against me in the heart of my domain? Foolish little girl. 

Rose: With how intent you were on my throwing them away…I think they just might!

Transformed Miranda: Don't resist. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth!

[Rose dodges Miranda's attacks with her new teleport ability!]

Transformed Miranda: There's nothing to fear. Let's see this power of yours. Here I come! Wretched little girl! And even if you were to survive? What would be the point? You can't save your father. You are of two different worlds. Offer yourself unto me!

[Rose inflicts tangible damage on Miranda that she falls to the ground.]

Rose: I won't let you do this!

Transformed Miranda: What is this!? It took so much to lure you here, but you're incredible! Well worth the effort.

Rose: You might change your mind when I put an end to your plans!

Transformed Miranda: You will fall before me. Come! Be by my side. Your time is at an end. I cultivated this world within the Megamycete to resurrect my sweet daughter. But no matter how many vessels I created, none had the power to regenerate her. That is why it must be you. You are the only one who can bring her back to me. Whatever it takes. Whatever I must do. I will see this through! 

[Rose seizes the moment and runs up to Miranda and shoots her in the face with her shotgun.]

Rose: Let's see you dodge this!

Transformed Miranda: Impossible! Do you still not see? There is no happy ending for you.

Rose: Says the wicked witch at the end of her reign!

Transformed Miranda: Kill me and you kill the only one who understands you. You just won't give up. You really are Ethan's daughter. That stubborn life that shines inside of you makes you the perfect vessel for my Eva. How do you possess such power? If I'm gone, nothing changes. Your suffering will never end! Now! Become mine.

Rose: Nope!

Transformed Miranda: Brat! What? This is the end. What is this!? I shall finish this! There is no victory for you! Finally, my struggle comes to fruition!

[The fight exhausts Rose. She hears her father's voice.]

Ethan: Rose…Over here…

Rose: Dad!

Ethan: Use this…Take her down!

[He gives her his powers, but it drains him greatly.]

Rose: (clenching her fist) Oh, I will.

Transformed Miranda: Return and yield your strength to me!

[Rose charges her new power and knocks Miranda out of the sky with her own tentacles.]

Transformed Miranda: So much power. You truly would have been the perfect vessel for my Eva.

Rose: I'm not a goddamn vessel. I'm not some stupid copy. I'm me. Rose. And you're done.

[She dries Miranda the same way she did with the flowers. At the end she shouts out…]

Transformed Miranda: My Eva!

[She turns to her father, lying on the ground and dying for the second time.]

Ethan: Hey, sweetie…

Rose: Oh my god!

Ethan: You're…so grown up now. And even though I wasn't there with you, I've always watched over you. I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you…

Rose: All you've ever done is protect me.

Ethan: No, not this time. You lost your chance…I'm so sorry…

Rose: No, it was my choice and I don't regret it one bit. If I had left you, then we never would have had this chance…to talk…face to face. 

[She cries and they hug.]

Rose: So it's OK.

Ethan: I'm so proud of you. I'm so very proud of you. I love you, Rose.

Rose: I love you too, Dad.

[The screen floods with white light and Rose wakes up in the lab chair.]

Rose: I'm back?

[She hesitantly extends her hand forward as if trying out reality for a test, or trying to use her fungal powers.]

Rose: I'm back…

[Her father's wedding ring remains in her hands.]

Rose: Dad…

[The next scene. Rose riding the bus and reading Village of Shadows, a children's book that Mia used to read to her. The scene repeats the final scene of the original game, which tells us that the events of the DLC took place before the credits of the original.]

Mom: Do you think the boy will be able to touch the moon?

Daughter: Nobody can touch the moon. It's too far away.

Mom: Wait, what if he has a rocket ship?

Daughter: OK, then you could touch it. But it would be very, very cold.

[The bus stops. We see it’s number - 8 ROWSPINE/SANTA—]

Mom: You were being silly. I don't think the moon feels like a killer whale.

Daughter: I think it does, but—

[Rose walks out of the bus. She arrived at the cemetery. She is holding a bouquet of beautiful white flowers.]

Rose: Hey Dad. Happy birthday.

[The tombstone reads - ETHAN WINTERS a kind husband and loving father who put family before all else.]

Rose: Sorry I missed last week. I have a lot of tests coming up. You know how it is.

[Someone in a black SUV honks at her.]

Rose: Talk of the goddamn devil. Duty calls. I love you.

[She walks towards the SUV.]

Man in Black: (via radio) Yeah, I found her…Where else? Today of all days. We have a situation. You're needed…Eveline.

[The girl grabs the man in black by the tie.]

Rose: (angry) Don't you ever call me that again.

Man in Black: (scared) Whoa, whoa. It's just a joke, Rose.

Rose: I can show you things even Chris doesn't know I can do.

Sniper: (via radio) We have a clear shot.

Man in Black: (via radio) Stand down. I can handle it. She's just a kid.

Rose: (sits in the SUV) Way to keep it together, Rose.

Man in Black: You're a lot like him, you know?

Rose: (smiles) I know.

[The SUV drives away.]
