[Black screen. In the background, we hear a voiceover.]

Jackie Estacado: I remember the night of my twenty-first birthday. That was the first time I died... 

Hell Ride
Nino Moretti: Estacado! Hello, Estacado! Come on, wake up sunshine! No, no up here, you Goombah. Come on, look at me!

[Jackie wakes up in the back seat of a convertible. He appears to have recently received a severe blow to the head. He and two mobsters are driving down the highway.]

Nino Moretti: Come on. What's the matter you pussy, huh? You get one little baby tap from a nightclub bouncer, you go to sleep on me over here? 

Mikey Cimino: Hey, I already told you. He don't look so good. That guy was a goddamn gorilla. Ugly too. 

Nino Moretti: Paulie's gonna rip our nuts off, he finds out we never collected his money. Oh, man... Man, we screwed the pooch on this one, Jackie. You know what Paulie's like, you don't collect, best not to even come home. 

Mikey Cimino: Hey, Paulie don't know nothin' alright. We'll tell him the money was stolen before we got there. Maybe he'll be nice 'cause it's Jackie's birthday…

Nino Moretti: The guy's a piranha, Mikey. He wouldn't know "nice" if it slapped him upside the head with a fifty pound sledgehammer. Jesus Christ, we gotta get a plan here. 

Mikey Cimino: Okay, okay... Practical question: you think Paulie will still want us to take out the foreman at the construction site? 'Cause I'm headed that way. 

Nino Moretti: Yeah... Yeah, I mean Paulie was adamant, right? I mean, maybe if we whack that guy nice and clean like, he won't be too hard on us, you think? 

Mikey Cimino: Maybe... But we gotta get there first. Hey, we got company... 

[The police start chasing them.]

Nino Moretti: Drive, goddamnit! 

Mikey Cimino: Hold on to your lunch! 

Nino Moretti: Christ Mikey! You're gonna kill us! (laughs)

Mikey Cimino: I told you they was coming. I heard the sirens. Didn't I say I heard sirens, Nino? 

Nino Moretti: You hear sirens in your sleep, Mikey. You gonna shake these assholes, or what? 

Mikey Cimino: Watch this... 

[He hands Nino a gun. He starts firing wildly at the policemen, trying to hold on to the seat of the speeding car.]

Nino Moretti: Yeah! You like that, pig! 

Mikey Cimino: Tell them they never take us alive! They hate that! 

Nino Moretti: Jackie, we gotta get to the Grave's End Construction site and take care of Paulie's contract on the foreman. Two jobs in one night, like we're slaves or something... Jackie, don't just sit there starin' like a retard. We gotta shake these pigs. Come on! Load up an' help me out! 

Loudspeaker: This is the New York City Police Department. Stop the car and step out with your hands in the air! 

Nino Moretti: Anytime you're ready, Jackie, huh? Take your time! Don't worry about getting our heads blown off! 

Mikey Cimino: Hoohoo, they got new uniforms! Did you see them new uniforms they got? Pretty sharp! 

Nino Moretti: Hey! Hey, these are Eddie Shrote's boys. 

Mikey Cimino: Why the hell are they shooting at us? They're supposed to be on Paulie's payroll. Fuck 'em! Paulie's gonna go apeshit on us anyway - so keep shootin'. 

Nino Moretti: Would you drive straight! I can't get a bead! 

Mikey Cimino: I am driving straight! You shoot straight! 

Nino Moretti: Mikey, you crazy bastard! 

Mikey Cimino: Hey, you wanna drive, jackass? 

Nino Moretti: Waste that guy on the left! I got the one trailing! Oh, sorry about that, officer! You missed! Come on, they're gaining on us! Oh, fuck meeeee... 

[A police car rams a mobster's car and Nino falls over the door of the convertible. A passing truck smashes his head off.]

Mikey Cimino: Nino! Oh, shit! Jackie... Jackie, you gotta get up here! Take Nino's place. I can't lose this guy. 

[Jackie throws Nino's corpse out of the car and sits in his place. He fires at the cops with an army shotgun.]

Mikey Cimino: Scratch one more of New York's Finest! That's for my buddy Nino, ass wipe! This is it! Hold onto your nut sack! This goes right into the construction site. So we better keep an eye out for them Irish boys, Jackie. Holy shit! Look out! Hahaha! Somebody better call cleanup. Hang on! What the fuck is this? They know we're coming for Christsakes! Jeez, some welcome-party, huh? Funny hats, guns and fucking everything. You think Paulie has something to do with this? I say ambush... Am-fucking-bush! 

[After ramming into a construction site, Mikey crashes into a wall.]

Jackie Estacado: (offscreen) Grave's End Construction Site... Aptly named. Classic mob-venture filled with blue-collar construction workers armed to the teeth. And my boss, Uncle Paulie, sent me here to whack the foreman. Like I said... Classic.

THE DARKNESS

[Jackie is lying on the floor of the construction site. His injuries are minimal. Mikey is less fortunate. His legs are broken, among other things.]

Mikey Cimino: Aww, man! This sucks donkey dick! Ohh, God! It hurts! Hey! I'm dyin' over here! Where the hell are you?

[Jackie pulls him away from the burning car. Mikey screams in pain.]

Mikey Cimino: Jeezis! I wouldn't wanna do that again. Ah! Aw, man. Would you look at that? These pants cost me four hundred bucks over at Sal's. Now they got bloodstains all over 'em. (groans then laughs) Some fuckin' twenty-first birthday for you, huh? Here… Got you a present.

[He gives him two guns.]

Jackie Estacado: Thanks, Mikey.

Mikey Cimino: Attaboy, Jackie. You look after those pieces an use 'em well. You know, this looks real bad... Real bad... Now go find out what's going on, then get the hell outta here. What's the matter, Jackie?

[Jackie shoots down the lock and goes inside the house under construction. At that moment he hears an eerie voice coming from some unknown place.]

Darkness: Jackie…

[Without paying much attention, Jackie rides the elevator. He hears voices.]

Paulie's Mafioso: You ever get that loan you applied for?

Paulie's Mafioso: Oh, yeah. Sure! They sent the money over in a covered wagon with an armed guard. They said I didn't hafta pay it back either.

[Jackie ruthlessly kills them. The construction site turns out to be full of mobsters who want Jackie to die quickly.]

Paulie's Mafioso: Jesus, Mary an' Joseph. Would you relax? I was only making small talk.

Darkness: Soon...

Paulie's Mafioso: That's him dammit!

Paulie's Mafioso: This is my Ghandi impression, Jackie!

Paulie's Mafioso: One clean shot an' he's dead

Paulie's Mafioso: Got him now!

Paulie's Mafioso: How can he still be standing!!??

[Jackie enters the elevator and goes upstairs. He hears the sound of helicopter blades and a woman's voice.]

Jane Unger: "News Watch Six" following a developing story… ...at the Graves End Construction site. Police reporting shots were fired… ...in the vicinity just moments ago. This is Jane Unger live on the scene… ...in the "News Watch Six" chopper. No confirmed reports of any casualties… ...but police are known to be racing to the scene.

Paulie's Mafioso: Peekaboo motherfucker!

Paulie's Mafioso: We can see movement down below.

Paulie's Mafioso: Oh fuck man!

[Jackie gets out on the roof and doesn't go into one of the apartments, breaking the glass. Inside there are several rapidly dying mobsters and a television set behind a table.]

Paulie Franchetti: (on video) Hey. It's your uncle Paulie. You know, you've been a pain in my ass since the day I met you, Jackie. Pissin' and moanin' about the way I do business. Well you need to learn who's calling the shots in this family. I've been very, very generous to you, Jackie. In fact, I've got a surprise for you… On your birthday. It's in the closet… Have a blast!

[Jackie opens the closet and finds a dead worker with a bomb strapped to him with an electronic clock. Jackie quickly runs to the exit, but does not have time and the blast wave throws him out of the window. He falls and crashes onto the asphalt.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Me an' Paulie never did agree about the way things were being done. Paulie took the business into selling drugs, working side by side with the cops. When I was growing up, the family had codes. We did business, we looked out for the people. I believe we ought to honor those codes. Now Paulie… he's just a parasite. Wants to bleed me dry.

Embrace the Darkness
[Jackie comes to her senses and goes to the cemetery.]

Paulie's Mafioso: I saw him! He came outta the window! Down there! He's goin' towards the cemetery! Tell the boys to drive around the block. We'll squeeze him in there!

Paulie's Mafioso: Where is he? I don't see him no more.

Paulie's Mafioso: I lost him too!

Paulie's Mafioso: Keep looking.

Darkness: Darkness will fall.

Man: Hey! Who's there? What are you doin' to my cemetery?

[A fierce firefight ensues.]

Paulie's Mafioso: Is someone over there?

Paulie's Mafioso: Aw fuck! Heeelp!

[Surrounded, Jackie walks into a public restroom where a homeless man has already settled in.]

Bum: Hey! Don't shoot me, son. Frank Rottenberg's the name. I live here. Smells like Satan's bung-hole, but it beats freezin' to death. 

Jackie Estacado: Yeah, nice place. Angel statue and everything.

Frank Rottenberg: What the hell are you talking about? You're in a piss parlor, kid. Unless you mean the Trinity Cemetery outside.

Jackie Estacado: Is there a way out of this fuckin' cemetery?

Frank Rottenberg: There's a gate at the north end. They got a lock on it though. Keeps out the undesirable element.

Paulie's Mafioso: He went in here!

Paulie's Mafioso: Never mind this old man…

[He is about to leave the bathroom and come face to face with his killers when suddenly he hears the eerie voice again.]

Darkness: Through you I will display my power. Through you I am born.

[A tentacle grows out of Jackie's body and smashes the light bulb. After that, two creepy eel-like creatures appear. They start mercilessly devouring the mobsters surrounding the restroom. The mobsters try to shoot, but Jackie takes no damage.]

Darkness: You are nothing but my puppet.

[The tentacles disappear. Jackie can now summon them whenever he wants. He uses one of his abilities to summon a Darkling, which pushes back the machine blocking the passageway. Jackie then uses his abilities to steal the key and sneaks into the subway.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) I've heard people complain that life is unpredictable. Well I never had a life that was predictable. But what happened to me today, that's why I need you, Jenny. You're the only one I can count on.

The Subway
[Jackie receives a message on his pager, "Jackie, running late? Call me ASAP. Jenny.” Walking through the turnstile, he notices a familiar face.]

Enzo Scardina: Yo, Jackie! It's me, Enzo! Wait up! I hear you pissed off your uncle Paulie. He put his boys out to look for you.You knock bones with one of his girls, or somethin'?

Jackie Estacado: Why don't you ask him?

Enzo Scardina: Uh-uh.. I steer clear of that little rat like he had the bubonic plague. What the hell did you do?

Jackie Estacado: Ehh... money was involved. I was unconscious at the time.

Enzo Scardina: Eh, well, what're you gonna do? Hey, I was wondering, you still seeing that girl, Jenny? 'Cause I'm thinking, you know... if you ain't... huh?

Jackie Estacado: Hey, I'm still seein' her. Matter of fact, she just paged me.

Enzo Scardina: Oh, okay... well, there's a phone down the platform you can call her from, you know. Hey, you say hi for me, okay?

[Jackie meets a familiar face again.]

George Hadel: It ain't fair, man. That asshole won't let me play my harmonica at my spot unless I give him a couple hundred bucks.

Jackie Estacado: Who won't let you play?

George Hadel: Big guy. He's always hangin' here. Goes by the name of Compton Scarr. If I could fight like I play I'd tear him a coupla new holes, just for kicks.

Jackie Estacado: You just gotta know how to persuade a guy. Wait here.

Compton Scarr: You got a problem, tough guy?

Jackie Estacado: Yeah. My problem is, I'm a big music lover an' I don't got no music to listen to. Now, my buddy with the harmonica, he's an honest-to-God virtuoso. So my suggestion is that you leave him alone an' let him do his thing.

Compton Scarr: And if I don't?

Jackie Estacado: Well, if you don't, I got a magic trick for ya: I see you around here again, dipshit, I'll put my arm down your throat an' pull a rabbit out your fuckin' ass.

Compton Scarr: Just relax, alright. He can play down here if he wants,

George Hadel: Thanks, son. I never would say this to no one... (singing) but you gotta good heart.

[Jackie walks past the television set on the chair. It's showing the news.]

Jane Unger: This is a News Watch Six Breaking News Special Report. I'm Jane Unger bringing you continued coverage on the latest on the Crane & Extine bombing. Police officials have dismissed the bombing as a random incident. Captain Edward Shrote was unavailable for comment. With us now over the phone is Lieutenant Gomer. Welcome, Lieutenant. Appreciate you joining us this evening.

Lieutenant Gomer: Thank you.

Jane Unger: Could you please give us an update on the current investigation into the Craine and Extine bombing?

Lieutenant Gomer: Absolutely. The Grave's End construction site bombing… ...seems to have been part of a feud between two small-time gangs. We have indications that lead us to suspect a foreign criminal organization… ...was involved in the laundering of drug money for the Craine & Extine construction company.

Jane Unger: I see. Do you have any suspects detained yet?

Lieutenant Gomer: We expect to have all suspects involved in this incident captured by tomorrow night. You know how we like to keep the trash in the garbage bin, Jane. (laughs)

Jane Unger: What about the reports of witnesses claiming a lone gunman was sighted on the scene? Some speculate that this was related to the mafia.

Lieutenant Gomer: Well, I wouldn't put much stock into crack-pot theories like that. As you know, the area where the bombing occurred is known for having… ...its share of drug-addicts and other suspicious elements. Now, those can hardly be relied upon for accurate information.

Jane Unger: Won't this work against your boss, Captain Edward Shrote, in the upcoming election?

Lieutenant Gomer: Absolutely not, no. Since Captain Shrote has been in office… ...crime-rates have plummeted thanks to his zero-tolerance policy. I think that the law-abiding and upstanding citizens of our fine city will want to keep it that way… ...and for that to happen they need him in office.

Jane Unger: Thank you for your time, Lieutenant. This is Jane Unger for News Watch Six saying thank you and good night.

[On his way out of the subway, he sees an old man.]

Nicky Barruci: Hey Jackie - it's me, Nicky Barruci! Hey, wait up! Good to see ya, Jackie. How ya doin'?

Jackie Estacado: You remember Jenny, right? She moved to a new place around here. It's supposed to be by some ballcourt. You know where it is?

Nicky Barruci: The basketball court. Sure. First street to the left and then second to the right. But in case you didn't hear me the first time… ...Paulie's got a hit out on you. So be careful.

Stairway to Heaven
[Jackie comes out of the subway.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Ever been in love with somebody who was so beautiful and pure… ...you couldn't dare to show them your own darkness? That's how I feel about you. We grew up together in St. Mary's Orphanage. I guess I'm gonna have to tell you the truth… ...about what kind of a scumbag I really am. What the hell am I gonna say?

Darkness: Stay in the shadows, Jackie.

[He walks slowly through the city, trying to stay away from crowded streets, as Paulie's men are still looking for him. Jackie smashes every light source he sees so he can use his new powers at any time.]

Paulie's Mafioso: Is someone over there? He's here! You suck, Estacado! I hate you!

Paulie's Mafioso: Goddamnit!

Darkness: Your power is in darkness.

[Jackie shoots a light bulb on a lamppost. Summoning the Darkness, he quickly kills the mobster.]

Paulie's Mafioso: This is fucked!

Paulie's Mafioso: Fucking weird!

Paulie's Mafioso: Enjoy your last few moments, maggot.

[After killing all the mobsters in the neighborhood, Jackie hears Jenny's voice from somewhere above.]

Jenny Romano: Jackie! Hello! Up here!

[She shouts to him from the top floor of a multi-story building.]

Jenny Romano: Hey, Jackie! Up here! Jackie! Hello! Up here! Hey, you found me! Come on upstairs, it's apartment eleven.

[Jackie goes up the stairs to the top floor and rings the doorbell.]

Jenny Romano: Jackie! Oh, my God! Can you believe this place? Come here, look on the kitchen table. Surprise! Cake. You won't believe this. Look… Giancarlo spelled your name wrong again. (laughs) Well? You gonna blow out the candles?

[Jackie blows out the candles.]

Jenny Romano: Happy birthday, rat-face! You're finally legal. I know you always piss and moan… ...about your birthday but I couldn't resist. I mean, you're only twenty-one once, right? Are you okay, babe? You're being kinda quiet.

Jackie Estacado: I gotta real problem, Jenny. Something happened today with my Uncle Paulie… ...and it's a real bad situation.

Jenny Romano: Paulie? What kind of situation?

Jackie Estacado: Okay, see… Here's the thing. I was supposed to collect some money for my Uncle Paulie downtown. Only the money wasn't there. And now Uncle Paulie's kinda pissed at me.

Jenny Romano: I'm sure it's gonna be okay. It's been, like, nine years since he took you home from the orphanage. Your uncle Paulie likes you. Doesn't he?

Jackie Estacado: Jenny… Baby, you don't get it. Uncle Paulie isn't a teddy bear. He's a fuckin' psychopath. And he's gonna kill me.

Jenny Romano: Kill you? What are you talking about? What exactly do you do for your Uncle Paulie anyway?

Jackie Estacado: Uhm… I'm a contract killer. I, uh… ...kill people… ...for the Franchetti Crime Family. I meant to tell ya… I just didn't know how, baby.

Jenny Romano: What? Are you nuts? You are nuts. This is just like you, Jackie. There's something else wrong and you're hiding it with… some kind of weird-ass story you just made up. Hey, come on.ЬIt's your birthday and I got a new apartment. Let's take one day off from fucked up'. Your friend Butcher came by today. He wanted you to call him when you could. I wrote the number on the notepad by the phone.

Darkness: She reeks of innocence.

Jenny Romano: Come on, sit here for a while Jackie. Watch some TV with me. Jackie, what is it? Let's just sit here for a while, okay?

[Jackie and Jenny sit down on the couch just to spend a few minutes together.]

Jenny Romano: You want the remote, don't you mister? No. My apartment, my TV, my remote. Are you cold, Jackie? God, it's freezing in here.

[She gets up from the couch and closes the window. Jackie waits for her to fall asleep and gets up. He goes to the phone to call Butcher.]

Butcher Joyce: Hello, Jackie. I heard about what happened tonight. I don't need to point out to you this is a bad situation. You'd better come an' see me.

Jackie Estacado: Where are ya? Heard through the grapevine you were at the Olive Grove.

Butcher Joyce: Yeah, and let me tell you something. It's a good thing your aunt Sarah's outta town. The Olive Grove is right next to her apartment… ...and this has been one messy afternoon. Now you get yourself over here… ...but tread lightly. I got my share of shit for tonight, okay?

Jackie Estacado: Hey, leave the goons to me. Now listen, Butch… Things are happening. I'm about to get my ass handed to me by a very nasty scumbag… ...whose name rhymes with 'Paulie Franchetti.'

Butcher Joyce: Okay, now I want you to know this. I do this only for you because of who your father was… ...and because you've always shown respect to your family. Now, listen… You go through Doyer's Alley across from Jenny's apartment. I got my car parked there. Make sure no one sees you. I'll leave the backdoor entrance to the kitchen open. You got that?

[Jackie hangs up and goes outside.]

Slaughterhouse
Pager: I saved you from that fucking orphanage! —Paulie

[The mafiosi, meanwhile, notice some guy who happens to look like Jackie and chase after him.]

Man: Aah! You got the wrong guy! Please stop!

[Jackie starts shooting at the mafiosi.]

Paulie's Mafioso: That's him! That's Estacado!

Paulie's Mafioso 2: Gonna take you to the pig farm, Jackie!

Paulie's Mafioso 3: Hey, what the fuck was that? Holy hell!

Man 2: Aw fuck! Heeelp!

Paulie's Mafioso: Jesus Christ! You turned out to be a real motherfucker Estacado!

Paulie's Mafioso: So what the hell is this all about anyways? I thought Jackie an' Paulie were tight.

[After killing a dozen mafiosi on the streets, Jackie enters Butcher's restaurant through the loading dock.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) If there's one untouchable in this business, it's Butcher Joyce. You put out a hit on some guy, Butcher flushes his body, and no one's ever the wiser. Butcher knows everyone's business. But what keeps him alive is that he never, ever chooses a side. Yeah... Too bad there's a war coming.

Butcher Joyce: I heard you coming from a block away, Jackie. Those expensive Italian shoes make you sound like a fuckin' bull elephant. Fuckin' new generation. Every cop for half a mile around probably knows you're here. Fuckin' cops, all I need now, huh? Grab that body, would you?

[Jackie helps Butcher because he has no arm and has difficulty carrying heavy bags.]

Butcher Joyce: Always, they gotta call me in when I'm eating dinner. Can't you people make your hits at a reasonable time of the day? You know, they told me there was only one… body to dispose of. It was supposed to be one of those dealers from the alley. So, what happens? Instead, some moron puts a bullet right between Chef Helmut's eyes.

[They load several bodies into the trunk of his car.]

Butcher Joyce: What're ya gonna do? Just drop it in the trunk. I'll take care of it. All right... good enough. What happened to you tonight?

Jackie Estacado: I wish the hell I knew, Butch. I dunno. I guess Paulie thinks I'm gunning for his throne… ...someone cold-cocks me on a take-down at Dino's. Next thing I know… ...I got the Fifth Italian Cavalry riding my ass.

Butcher Joyce: You know me, Jackie, I never choose sides. Whatever the problem is, it's up to you and Paulie to solve it. If this gets out of hand the Chicago families will intervene and when that happens, nobody wins. You beat Paulie's guys and he's not a good loser. Now I wouldn't put it past him to throw Eddie Shrote on your ass. Cops... fuckin' cops.

Jackie Estacado: Hey... What is the story with Eddie Shrote? How long has he been in bed with Paulie?

Butcher Joyce: Shrote and Paulie were in cahoots long before Paulie became the Don. Back in my day, you paid a cop off and he looked the other way. In Shrote's case, that didn't quite cut it. Paulie helped him bust enough heads that Shrote made Police Captain. Now that means he's got an entire precinct right at his disposal. You watch out for him: he owns the NYPD. That's why him and Paulie do business together. Now you listen to me, Jackie: your only option is to take down Paulie before he takes you down. Put a big enough dent in his business and the Chicago people will see to it he has an accident. I would never be one to suggest how you do this. But if you ask me, you need to pay a visit to Dutch Oven Harry. Put some holes in him.

Jackie Estacado: Dutch Oven Harry? No, never heard of him.

Butcher Joyce: Who's Dutch Oven Harry? I'll tell you. Harry's Paulie's biggest dealer of illicit medicine - he works out of a building in Hunterspoint. If I were the kind of man to be involved in things like this, I'd take down Harry... ...and pull all of his merchandise out of the building. But I'm not, see? You don't wanna come walking up to their front door, so go through that run-down billiards club… ...at Whitefish Alley. There's a back door leading to Hunterspoint from there. Ah fuck - the cops. This is why I don't get involved. Get back inside.

[The restaurant is surrounded by cops. Jackie destroys all light sources with his pistol. One of the cops starts talking into a megaphone.]

Edward Shrote: Jackie Estacado - this is Captain Edward Shrote New York Police Department. We know you're in there. Come out with your hands up and nobody gets hurt. Well, nobody anyone gives a shit about.

[The police take the restaurant by storm. Jackie defends himself.]

Policeman: I heard something.

Policeman: Over here!

Policeman: He ain't comin' out, Cap.

Edward Shrote: We're gonna call it resisting arrest. Take him out, boys! You caused me a lot of trouble, boy - running around shooting people, getting the media involved.

Policeman: Spray the bastard!

Policeman: Fuck!

Policeman: Holy shit! Get outta the way!

Edward Shrote: I got too many fucking people asking me questions.

Policeman: You! Over there!

Edward Shrote: Me and your Uncle Paulie, we see eye to eye. Nice and simple. The last goddamn thing we need is some little punk like you comes in and makes people asking me questions. And now I got a lot of cleaning up to do. All because you don't know how to play dead. But you're gonna be in the ground, Estacado. Sooner or later - it makes no difference to me.

[A real war with the police begins.]

Policeman: Give it up, Estacado!

Policeman: Fuck this shit - I'm getting' outta here!

Policeman: Five bucks says he's mine.

Policeman: Take him down!

Policeman: Stand still, you little Guinea piece of shit.

Policeman: Aw, shit.

Policeman: Put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye.

Policeman: Hey! You hear a sound?

Policeman: Hey, Estacado! No hard feelings, huh?

Policeman: I hear they eat guys like you in jail!

Policeman: Advance!

Policeman: Are you serious?

Policeman: How you like me now, Estacado?

Policeman: Retreat!

Policeman: How you like me now, Estacado?

Policeman: Any last words, Jackie?

[Jackie manages to disappear in a long, dark tunnel.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) I used to come to these piers pretty often. Most of the time it was to fit some poor asshole with a pair of concrete boots. People don't swim so good wearing boots.

[The cops are chasing Jackie in cars.]

Policeman: Over there!

Policeman: Fuck! Fucking eat this, you fuck fuck!

[After killing them Jackie walks into Hunters Point Alley.]

Hurt His Business
Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Listen... The best way to my Uncle Paulie's heart is through his ribcage with a meat cleaver. Failing that, you screw up his distribution and let the Chicago people collect on him… Now, I been all over town, picking up Paulie's drug money from his street peddlers… ...But I never been to Dutch Oven Harry's.

[In the basement he hears pleasant, melodic music over the radio. Jackie notices two decent-looking people talking.]

Man 1: Can I ask you a question?

Man 2: Sure.

Man 1: Okay. Hypothetically speaking, right? Would a moose have sex with me if I gave it ten million dollars?

Man 2: Well, that's a lot of money.

Man 1: So would it?

Man 2: I guess it would depend on the moose. If it was a genetically altered moose with the brain-power equal to a human and capable of speech, I'd have to say yes.

Man 1: Okay. And where would I find such horny, naughty mooses-es?

Man 2: Hmmm… ...Sweden, most likely. And everyone knows that Swedes are open minded when it comes to sex. Cross-species sex too, I'm sure.

Man 1: Yeah, those filthy Swedes. God bless 'em.

[Jackie goes out into the alley and approaches one of the bums.]

Matty Forehand: Hey, hey, hey... What say you slip me a couple of bucks, eh? Huh? I gotta take a train… Say, you got any liquor on you?

Jackie Estacado: Sorry, pal. I'm dry. Hey, you know Dutch Oven Harry?

Matty Forehand: Oh, you wanna get wired up? You go by the side door an' tell 'em old Matty Forehand sent you. If they ask, you say 'hit-me!' and then they bring the really good shit. Now you make sure not to point any guns in their general direction. I don't wanna get caught in the crossfire.

Darkness: Night is your master.

Dmitri Mihailov: What's the password?

Jackie Estacado: "Hit me." I gotta see Dutch Oven Harry.

Dmitri Mihailov: Come on in. Harry ain't around. You want something, talk to Roach.

[Jackie walks into a den of drug dealers.]

Man 1: Hey, Bobby. Harry wants you to do the clean-run tonight.

Man 2: What, are you fucking crazy? I got a date with that stripper, Camille, from the Pink Pony, the one with the huge tits.

Man 2: Now you tell him I ain't doin' it.

Man 1: Yeah... nice try. You tell him. I've grown attached to my testicles over the years an' I'm planning on keeping them.

Man 2: All right. Fine. I'll do it. Tell him I'm on it.

Man 1: You know Camille's really a guy, don't you?

Man 2: Yeah, so?

[Jackie finds Roach. He sits in his own separate "office.”]

Roach Librizzi: Hey... get a move on, huh, pal? I got a hot date tonight with a couple of Gino's girls. I got everything. Whatta you need?

Jackie Estacado: I need Harry. Where is he?

Roach Librizzi: You got some nerve, kid…

[His phone rings and Roach answers it.]

Dutch Oven Harry: Hey, Roach!

Roach Librizzi: What's up, Harry?

Dutch Oven Harry: Just got a call from the boss. Someone's coming to pay us a visit.

Roach Librizzi: Oh, he's already here. Harry, you want me to bring out the 'hard liquor'?

[Realizing where the wind is blowing, Jackie quickly kills Roach, after which a firefight ensues.]

Drug dealer: Look over here!

Drug dealer: Come on, Jackie. Stick your face out. Give me a target!

Drug dealer: He's rippin' us to shreds!

[Quickly killing all the drug dealers, Jackie picks up Roach's phone.]

Dutch Oven Harry: Roach, it's Harry. What's going on down there? Is Estacado fixed or what?

Jackie Estacado: You're probably wondering who is this… Well... Roach took the evening off... I'm the new guy.

Dutch Oven Harry: Estacado, you little shit! Why don't you make yourself at home? I'll send down a couple of my guys to fit you for a pine overcoat - on the house.

Drug dealer: He's over here!

Drug dealer: Holy hell!

[Jackie climbs the fire escape to the top floor. He looks around with the help of Darkness.]

Drug dealer: Harry's a little pussy - he fights like a nine-year old left-handed retard.

Drug dealer: That's what I been sayin' all along. If Paulie wasn't covering his ass, he'd have taken a dirt bath a long time ago.

[Darkness rips one of the drug dealers' faces off.]

Drug dealer: Got him now!

Drug dealer: Start shooting!

Dutch Oven Harry: (via phone) You think you accomplished something here, Estacado? I got news for you, you little shit! You ain't done nothin' that Paulie won't undo in a second.

Drug dealer: I got him now!

Drug dealer: You're a dead man.

Drug dealer: Estacado! You fucking traitor!

Darkness: Show no mercy.

Drug dealer: He's right here!

Drug dealer: Get the bastard fuck!

[Jackie gets to the upper floors, treading on the corpses. He hears Harry's voice coming from the roof.]

Dutch Oven Harry: He's coming, Paulie! He's coming! Blow it up, Paulie! Now!

Darkness: This human is evil.

[Jackie goes out on the roof. Something explodes and Harry falls from the roof right onto the train tracks and crashes to his death. In addition, his corpse is run over several times by a train.]

Darkness: Feed me.

[Jackie allows the Darkness to devour Harry's heart, which gives him a new ability - Darkling Gunner.]

Darkling: Ready for action! Assume tactical positions! Your ass is mine.

[He shoots at the next train and it goes off the track. Jackie is now free to walk through the dark tunnel.]

Darkness: They burn, Jackie. All the little ones. Such delicate torture of the body and soul.

Burned Memories
Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) My Uncle Paulie's pretty much a scumbag. Not that anyone has the balls to tell him to his face. Paulie took me out of an orphanage I lived in after my parents died. It's kinda like being rescued from a shark attack by a Grizzly bear. The only reason he took me in was 'cause he needed another hitman. We never did see eye to eye.

[Jackie comes out of the tunnel into the subway station.]

Pager: Call me! —Jenny

[A local crazy old man walks past Jackie.]

Frank Huntzinger: There was no warning... We heard only the sound of gunfire... The smell of trenches…

[Jackie finds a pay phone.]

Jenny Romano: Jackie, did you hear on the news about Saint Mary's Orphanage? Oh, God, it's so horrible. That was our home, Jackie.

Jackie Estacado: Yeah, I don't know what to do or feel about it. All I know is that it's evil. Where are you?

Jenny Romano: I'm at home but I'm going by there right now to see if there's anything I can do to help. Jimmy's picking me up. Can we meet at Fulton Street, by the exit to the orphanage? You can take the train from Canal and be at Fulton in a minute.

Jackie Estacado: I'll be there as soon as I can.

[He boards the train and goes to the orphanage.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Anyone who says the Subway is dangerous never sat in the back of a Yellow cab… ...going the wrong way at ninety miles an hour through the Midtown Tunnel… ...with a guy who can't speak a lick of English: My buddy, Crazy Abdul.

[Jackie is walking toward the subway exit and hears a fresh news report from the TV.]

Jane Unger: This is a News Watch Six Breaking News Special Report. In a stunning turn of events, the Saint Mary's Orphanage is currently the site of a massive firefighting operation… ...following what witnesses have described as an explosion, turning a random bombing in the city into a trend. Live on the scene is News Watch Six reporter Matt Devon. Matt, what do you have for us?

Matt Devon: Jane, behind me is a scene of chaos as New York's Fire Department tries to subdue… ...the raging fire that has claimed the Saint Mary's orphanage. Earlier reports that this might have been a terrorist attack have been quelled… ...by captain Edward Shrote of the New York Police Departement. He has said that the explosion was likely the result of a gas leak… ...and that there's currently no suspicion of criminal activity having been involved in this tragic accident. As you can see behind me the fire is still way out of control… ...and the fire departement is desperate may still be alive inside-- Shit! 

Firefighter: Get outta here!

Matt Devon: Jane, we've been asked to leave the area, it's not safe for us to be here.

Jane Unger: Alright, thank you Matt. Stay tuned for more information on this developing story on News Watch Six.

[Jackie approaches Jimmy and Jenny, standing nearby.]

Jimmy The Grape: Hey, good to see you, Jackie. Listen, I wish we could be meetin' under better circumstances, but you know the way things are.

Jenny Romano: Oh my God, Jackie… this is so awful. No one's heard from Sister Mary. The police said it was kind of gas main explosion but it feels like they're hiding something.

Jimmy The Grape: Our Sister Mary? Jesus, what about the kids?

Jenny Romano: Two or three died. One of the firemen told me some have severe burns.

Jimmy The Grape: Yeah I know, Jenny. It's a terrible thing sweetie, it's a terrible thing. But, you mind if I have a quick word with Jackie?

Jenny Romano: Okay, I guess…

Jimmy The Grape: Jackie, come here. Let me tell you something. I've seen this shit happen time an' time again ever since that fat fuckin' Paulie took over the mob. You understand? He's out of his fuckin' mind. Last week he cut off Tony Lucchesi's big toe. Why? 'Cause of a fuckin' baseball game. Could you believe that? A disagreement over a baseball game. That fat piece of shit thinks he can't be touched, right? Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! He's gonna be touched. Oh, boy is he gonna be touched. I'm tellin' you. Someone goes to Grinder's Lane and burn all the fuckin' money he's holdin' for the Chicago guys!

Jackie Estacado: Listen, Jimmy. You know out of respect I would never do something like that unless you guys gave the word. If I make a move, will you keep an eye on Jenny?

Jimmy The Grape: Jackie. Like she was my own flesh an' blood, I swear to God. Just kick the fuck out of them, you hear me? Kick the fuck out of them.

[Jackie goes to the subway exit, but it is blocked.]

Officer Penny: I'm sorry sir, we cannot let you in through there. There was an explosion in the Orphanage. It's been sealed off.

Jenny Romano: (to Jimmy) Yeah, she was tough on us but she was the only mother we had and those poor kids… I can't stop thinking about them. I hope they didn't suffer.

[Jackie finds another way out of the subway.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) They called this place Gun Hill after four thousand people died here during the Revolution. Even to this day, they say you can still hear the cries of the dead and the dying as you sleep. I hear 'em.

Man: Hey, come here! There's a guy up there! He's gonna jump!

Woman: Oh, my God. He's gonna jump!

Man: Ten bucks says he's pavement pizza within ten minutes. Did anyone call the cops yet?

Woman: The cops? What the hell are the cops gonna do? This guy needs professional help. I know.

Man: Fine. Just wait ten minutes. Any takers?

Woman: You are sick. You are a sick bastard. Twenty minutes, tops. But you're not allowed to say anything to influence him.

Man: It's a deal. Double or nothin' says he doesn't reach into the street.

Woman: You are goin’ straight to hell, you know that mister?

Man: Hey, at least I go there with twenty more bucks than before.

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) This place reminds me of this guy I knew, Joey Polanco. He had this bad habit of killing the wrong people all the time... Dumbest fuckin' hitman in history. Uncle Paulie threw him under the train down there.

[Jackie has to do several transfers!]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Grinder's Lane. This is the center of Paulie's operation. Place always makes me want to kick a fucking dog - or something. 

[Jackie walks out of the subway onto the street.]

Bum: Hey, I wouldn't hang out around here if I was you, Pal. I mean, there is somethin' that just ain't right about this place.

[Jackie approaches the heavily guarded meatpacking plant owned by Paulie.]

Paulie's Mafioso: Paulie Franchetti gets pissed off at his own nephew, sends him to collect some cash from Dino's, and then sets him up for an ambush?

Paulie's Mafioso: There he is!

[Jackie demonstrates his new abilities.]

Paulie's Mafioso: What the hell...!?

Paulie's Mafioso: Exactly. He's a prince amongst men.

Paulie's Mafioso: Prince of fuckin' Darkness, more like. 

Paulie's Mafioso: So how come Estacado got away?

Paulie's Mafioso: Who the hell knows? We cornered him at the cemetery right, but apparently, he had some backup…

Paulie's Mafioso: I got movement here!

[A firefight ensues.]

Paulie's Mafioso: Shit fuck!

Darkness: Human flesh festers.

[Jackie finds a way into the warehouse.]

Paulie's Mafioso: Is someone over there?

Paulie's Mafioso: Die already! Die die die!!!

Paulie's Mafioso: I need some help over here!

Paulie's Mafioso: Fuck this, I'm taking off!

Paulie's Mafioso: Oh fuck man!

Paulie's Mafioso: Got him now!

Paulie's Mafioso: Eyes over here!

Paulie's Mafioso: Come on, Jackie. Stick your face out. Give me a target!

Paulie's Mafioso: Watch out!

Paulie's Mafioso: Jackie! You motherfucking worthless piece of shit!

Paulie's Mafioso: This way! Come on!

Paulie's Mafioso: Yeah motherfucker!!!

Jackie kills people and finds a lot of Paulie's money in one of the rooms. All that remains is to find some gasoline. After walking around, he finds a workshop with a radio transmitter.

Radio: This is Captain Andre Kuchev of the Santa Maria, heading South Southwest on bearing One East Three-Eight-Five… ETA as planned. Over and out.

[After taking the can of gasoline, Jackie burns the money and leaves the meatpacking plant on his way back to the subway.]

A Night To Remember
Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) I love this Subway station. Uncle Paulie brought me down here on vacation one time to count the trains. Best two days me an' him ever spent together.

[On his way to the station, he finds Jimmy badly beaten, lying on the floor.]

Jimmy the Grape: Jackie, they snuck up on me and nailed me from behind. Paulie and that fuckin' piece of shit Eddie Shrote. But listen, you gotta get to the orphanage. They took Jenny to the orphanage, you gotta get there. Go on, move quick! Move!

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) When you kill for a living, life's only precious if you're staring down the barrel of a gun - or somebody you care about is. Paulie can have my possessions, my life, anything I own… Anything, except you… ANYTHING!

[Since there are no more cops, no one restricts the exit from the subway. Jackie gets out and immediately starts killing Paulie's men.]

Paulie's Mafioso: What, just like that?

Paulie's Mafioso: Get over here and cover my ass!

[Jackie walks into the yard of the burnt-out orphanage. He hears children's voices from the depths of his memory.]

Darkness: Remembering something Jackie?

[When Jackie goes inside he is overcome by memories. Here and there he hears voices from the past.]

Sister Mary: Finish your soup, Jackie. Be thankful.

Darkness: Be thankful…

[Jackie follows the ghosts of the past.]

Ghost of Jackie: I'm not gonna go… Can't make me… I'm gonna stay here with Jenny… Can't make me go anywhere I don't want..

Ghost of Jenny: Promise me, Jackie. No more frogs, no more killing. Promise... 

Ghost of Jackie: No more killin'. 

Ghost of Jenny: Cross your heart and hope to die?

Ghost of Jackie: Cross my heart and hope to die.

Ghost of Jenny: Did you feel that? It got so cold all of a sudden...

Ghost of Jackie: I don't feel nothin'.

[It’s Ironic that Jackie is standing right next to Jenny's ghost.]

Darkness: This will be a night to remember.

Ghost of Jenny: It's not fair, Jackie. Why do you have to go?

Ghost of Jackie: I'll come back…

Ghost of Jenny: I don't wanna be without you… You promised you'd always stay with me…

Ghost of Jackie: I gotta go… My Uncle Paulie's waiting for me…

Ghost of Jenny: Don't go with him…

Darkness: Too late, Jackie. Love dies.

[Jackie tries to reach for the weapon, but Darkness knocks it out of his hands.]

Darkness: Learn that you are my puppet. Now watch this!

[Darkness restrains Jackie and leads him to the glass window in the door of the next room, which contains Paulie, Jenny, and Edward Shrote.]

Jenny Romano: I said let me go, you dick. Jackie was so right about you.

Paulie Franchetti: Aw, shut up, you dumb broad. You're givin' me a fuckin' headache!

Edward Shrote: This was your idea, Franchetti. If it was up to me, I'd blown her brains out already.

Paulie Franchetti: Yeah, well it's not up to you.

Jenny Romano: Fuck you! Why are you doing this?

Edward Shrote: Maybe you should ask your boyfriend when he gets here.

Jenny Romano: Jackie? Why, haven't you fucked him over enough?

Paulie Franchetti: Aw, shut your fuckin' mouth, bitch! (punches her)

[Jackie resists, but Darkness holds his arms tightly.]

Darkness: Be still and watch

Jenny Romano: Okay... Please don't kill me.

[She tries to break free, but Shrote hits her hard in the face.]

Jackie Estacado: Aw, God… Dammit!

Darkness: Your flesh is mine. Your will is mine.

[Shrote notices Jackie.]

Edward Shrote: Well, well, well, just in time. I heard you and your girlfriend grew up here, Estacado. What a shithole. And now the place looks like it was hit by a bomb.

Paulie Franchetti: (to Jenny) Broke my nose.

Edward Shrote: Oh, what's the matter? Don't know your ass from your elbow with all that demon shit?

Paulie Franchetti: You know why we're here? 'Cause you hurt me, Jackie! I took you in for my own! I trusted you! So now all this blood is on your hands.

Jackie, what's going on? Get me out of here.

Paulie Franchetti: Aw, shut the fuck up! You see a happy ending here, Jackie? You figure you got something to bargain with me? So's that I don't blow her fuckin' brains out her fuckin' nose? 'Cause the way I see it, you got nothing!

Edward Shrote: It just gets bigger an' bigger, don't it, Jackie-boy? We hurt you, you hurt us. It's like some fucking game we're playing here. You caused me a lot of trouble, boy.

Darkness: She's mine.

Paulie Franchetti: You were my blood, Jackie. I loved you like a son, an' you took from me. You stole my respect and you stole my trust. And when blood takes from blood, someone always pays. So now, I take from you.

[He leans Jenny's head against the glass…]

Jenny Romano: Jackie, this is not your fault.

[...and pulls the trigger. Jackie hits the glass with his fists. Paulie aims her revolver at him.]

Paulie Franchetti: Clean that mess up…

[Darkness reveals itself and breaks the glass. Shrote and Polly run away in terror. Darkness lets Jackie go. He runs to Jenny's body.]

Darkness: (mockingly) No! What did they do to Jenny? She was a burden. This is freedom.

[Jackie picks up Paulie's revolver.]

Darkness: Where are you going?

[He walks slowly to the mirror and puts the revolver to his head.]

Darkness: No, Jackie! this is not your time!

[The Darkness resists. Jackie pulls the muzzle of the revolver into his mouth.]

Darkness: No! Cannot! Must not!

[However, Jackie manages to pull the trigger. The screen goes black.]

Jackie Estacado: (offscreen) And that… Well… That was the first time I died.

The First Time I Died
Darkness: You wronged me, Jackie. You betrayed my gift.

[Jackie goes to war. World War I by the looks of it. A German officer shoots prisoners.]

Darkness: You should not be here.

[Jackie kills a German officer and goes to explore the trench. For a while Jackie just goes and kills abstract German soldiers without a face with old guns.]

Darkling: I would like to do some mischief. Violence is the answer! 

Darkness: Hell has no form. It bends to my whim. This is my dream of you. The sun grows ever darker. Pestilence. One of the four. 

Darkling: I must kill something. How do you spell Carnage?

Darkness: The flame of life shall be put into shadow. All men are cattle.

[Jackie comes to the positions of the British soldiers.]

British Soldier: In the face of death, they say, he had no fear. His comrades, when they laid him in a Flanders grave, wrote on a rough hewn cross - a Cavalry stood near - "Without fear he gave." The thundering line of battle stands and in the air Death moans and sings.

British Soldier: You're going to need to reach the village through the sewers. But be sharp about it... the Hun are closing in. Have a word with Corporal Greenwood. He can show you the way to the sewers.

Captain William Eldridge: You're with that other Yank, aren't you? The one in the village. My name is Captain William Eldridge. Second Army of the British Expeditionary Force. You must be the Yank we've been hearing about. You're probably wondering about the spot of bother you've got yourself into. Bit of a sticky wicket, eh? I can't tell you much-need to know basis, and all that.

Corporal Greenwood: You're going that way, son an' I wouldn't fool about - I've seen things down there that would make grown men cry. If I were you I'd get in there, sharpish. Keep moving an' don't look back, whatever you do.

[Jackie opens the hatch and goes down the stairs.]

Darkness: Whatever you do, stay away.

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) There's no explanation for what's happened to me. Maybe this place isn't a place at all. Maybe it's a state of mind. I mean, I'm supposed to be dead. I remember you. I remember the gunshot. (quietly) I think I'm in Hell.

Darkness: Jackie, go back... or be lost forever. Worse than hell. Nothing can come of this. Turn away…

British Soldier: Rule Brittania, eh?

Darkness: Nothing for you here.

[Jackie comes to the surface.]

British Soldier: I say... it's young Estacado! Best get into the church, eh? He's waiting for you in the church.

Darkness: It's a lie, Jackie.

British Soldier: Everything ship-shape and Bristol fashion?

British Soldier: I, on that familiar hill, saw with uncomprehending eyes a hundred sunsets spill their fresh and sanguine sacrifice. Ere the sun swings his noonday sword must say goodbye to all of this - by all delights that I shall miss, help me to die, Oh Lord.

[In the infirmary, Jackie finds an interesting person... his relative.]

Anthony Estacado: Jackie! Jackie! Holy shit, are you a sight for sore eyes! Listen, kid... I know there are a lot of things you're not gonna understand but you gotta trust me. Now you've arrived, I think we're gonna find out what's happening here.

Jackie Estacado: Do I know you?

Anthony Estacado: My name is Tony Estacado. Okay, this is gonna sound weird… But I guess that I'm your great, great Grandfather.

Jackie Estacado: The Darkness... What the hell is it?

Anthony Estacado: The Darkness is a living thing. It's some kind of a creature, old as time. It passes down from generation to generation… ...making itself known on the firstborn male's twenty-first birthday.

Jackie Estacado: What do you know about the Darkness? Do you know why it chose me?

Anthony Estacado: I don't know... it needs a host, I guess. I messed up, Jackie - I brought it into the family. I didn't realize it would do this to us!

Jackie Estacado: What the hell is this place?

Anthony Estacado: Don't you see it? Everything happened here, Jackie… this is where it all began. That's why I'm back in this goddamn nightmare war. It's why we all are. I brought this Darkness into our family... This is all my fault.

Jackie Estacado: How do I stop this... And how do I get out?

Anthony Estacado: Listen... there might be a way to control it.  I found out that a long time ago, one of the human hosts forged two special weapons that were used to control the Darkness. Promise me, Jackie, that you'll go find them. You gotta work out how to control this damn thing before it's too late. Don't listen to the Darkness, Jackie - it'll lie to protect itself. Just keep going and don't look back.

Darkness: Don't believe him.

[Jackie sees a skinny horse with a basket of apples next to it, but for some reason it doesn't want to eat them.]

Darkness: Famine.

Darkness: Go no further Jackie.

[However, he no longer pays attention to the advice of Darkness.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Couple of things about the Estacado Family… One… ...we don't give up. *spits*

Darkness: Hell behind you. Hell awaits you.

[Jackie enters the battlefield.]

Darkness: Stolen secrets... you'll find only pain. Death. One of the four.

[Exploring the eerie battlefield, Jackie finds a soldier hanging by his legs.]

The Crucified: Do you know the word of hope?

Jackie Estacado: (quietly to his ear) Jenny…

The Crucified: Use the weapons wisely for the Darkness will consume your soul.

[Jackie gets Darkness Guns!]

Jackie Estacado: What are these things?

The Crucified: Centuries ago, before the dawn of history, a Darkness host found a precious item that helped bring the Darkness under control. The Darkness feared control. Centuries later, I fashioned the guns to harness its power into a weapon. Over time, others refined them... improved them… I once imagined, I too would control the Darkness. Remember, a powerful enemy now festers within you.

Darkness: Defiance means nothing. I'll bury your soul. I'll tear out your heart.

[Jackie returns to his relative.]

Anthony Estacado: Jackie? What the... You found them?

Jackie Estacado: I got them. What now?

Anthony Estacado: The Brits have been fighting for centuries to get to those hills, but you're the one who made it. Alright, here's what else I know. There's this thing... The Darkness keeps it heavily fortified - a cannon outside an old castle.

Jackie Estacado: Help me understand... why are you here? What's with the soldiers?

Anthony Estacado: Jeeziz, Jackie. I don't remember. I don't think I'm allowed to. I think the Darkness does this to its hosts. It devours our souls, tricks us into using it and then keeps us dangling on the line like a fish. Look, I gotta plan for you, but you're not gonna like it. You've gotta get to that cannon. And the only way is through this catacomb. Right down here. There's an underground sewer system that leads to the cannon. Krauts and strange things are crawling every-damn-where. I think the Darkness put them there for a reason. The only way is through the catacombs. Right down here. Steady your rifles! Keep your eyes peeled! First thing that moves, shoot it dead. Okay, Jackie! Get going! Move as fast as you can. Don't look back! Get going! Close it up quickly before they catch our scent!

British Soldier: I don't like it, Sir. Place is crawling with the damned Hun. And worse.

Darkness: This is a mistake.

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) There's something important here that the Darkness is trying to protect. I can feel its agitation. But if I stay the course, if I defy the voices in my head and never look back, maybe up ahead I'll see a light. And maybe in that light - I'll see you Jenny.

Darkness: Everything you know is a lie.

Darkling: Let me cut someone. Shirley the Brick!

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Somewhere, somehow, the Darkness is doing whatever it can to keep me alive… ...because it needs a human host. But not one that thinks and acts for itself… like me.

Darkness: You have done well Jackie. I was always on your side. This was just a test. You should not have been here.

Darkling: Okey-Dokey! Da, Comrade! Yes! We are not alone.

Darkness: Your gift. Your heritage. Your burden.

Darkling: Let's go shopping! Yeppers. Here's mud in your eye. Anyone want to play?

[Jackie walks out to the giant train.]

German Soldier: You're not supposed to be here! Leave it alone! Stay away from the controls!

[Jackie turns the train around.]

German Soldier: You're doing everything wrong.

Darkness: Fixed your broken head ball. You have passed my test. No more dreaming.

[Jackie returns to the world of the living. He, too, sits in the cabin of the train... only this time it's modern.]

Darkness: Your day. Your time.

Machinist: Sir! Get out. Raus!

The machinist pushes Jackie out of the car. He ends up at the subway station.

Woman: Hey! Yo, Estacado, is that you?

Jimmy The Grape: My God, Jackie! Where the fuck you been hiding? First Jenny gets murdered, your ass goes up in smoke… Everyone figured Paulie blew you the fuck away.

Jackie Estacado: He did, Jimmy. I just came back, is all.

Jimmy The Grape: You know your Aunt Sarah, that poor woman. That poor woman would just sit there in her Raspberry Street apartment... ...and wait just for you, yeah just for you to show up. You ever do one thing right in this whole mess... ...in this whole life of yours, you go down to the Lower East Side and you see her. You hear me? You go down to Raspberry Street and you go see your Aunt Sarah.

Unrepayable Debt
Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) My Aunt Sarah. Now, she taught me about life. After I left the orphanage, she was the one person who cared for me. And she loved you. Now, when her husband Jimmy Franchetti died, the family forgot about her. Except for the older guys… ...and me.

[Jackie gets off the subway and stops by the aunt who lives nearby.]

Aunt Sarah: Jackie! I've been so worried about you! I heard you were gone and I feared the worst. You look thin. Have you been eating? You come on inside. C'mon. You want some minestrone? I know what's happened, Jackie. You know how much I've always loved you. You know how I hate it when our family turns against each other like this.

Jackie Estacado: Aunt Sarah... I lost her. What the hell am I gonna do without Jenny?

Aunt Sarah:  It's terrible...... I cleaned out her apartment. She was waiting for you, Jackie - anyone but you could see it. You should have taken her away from this place when you had the chance. Now you've got to take care of it.

Jackie Estacado: I'm real sorry for the way things came out, Aunt Sarah. You know I never meant any disrespect… ...to you an' the family. But I'm gonna have to take a stand against Paulie and Eddie Shrote… ...and punish them for what they did.

Aunt Sarah: I know. Some of the older men, they'll support your decision, Jackie. But you're gonna have to earn their trust. If you were to hurt Paulie's operation… ...they might consider joining ya. They want things back the way they used to be.

Jackie Estacado: I'm gonna tear his face off, Aunt Sarah, pardon my language. But I'm gonna rip that dirty little motherfucker's face off and feed his lips to the fuckin' rats. But I can't kill that little fuckin' scumbag without your blessing, you know that.

Aunt Sarah: Well, "kill" is such a dirty word. But, do what you have to do. And understand that you won't get to Paulie unless you go through his police dog first. The only way to Paulie is through Captain Eddie Shrote. Now, I happen to know he has an apartment up by Gun Hill. And I spoke to Jimmy the Grape and he's arranged for a man named Abe Hunter to let you into the building. I suggest you go there and take up Jimmy's offer of help while you can.

[Jackie leaves her aunt's house and goes down to the subway.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) It's like I have everything to live for, and nothing to gain. I got nothing worth having without you. But at least I got a purpose. And that's tearing Eddie Shrote into a thousand pieces. It's my reason to live.

[After getting off the train, Jackie approaches a man standing at the station.]

Mitch Deval: Let's say you could get past this gate - you could walk all the way to the old City Hall Station. Long as you didn't tread on any dead hookers. (laughs) 

Jackie Estacado: What's at City Hall Station?

Mitch Deval: I'm trying to find my brother, Ernie. I think he went down that way. You see Ernie Deval, you tell him his brother Mitch is waiting for him. You tell him to get his sorry ass back here.

Woman: Show me them moves, D-Style. Let's see if you got what it takes.

Man: Nice moves!

[Jackie comes out of the subway.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Even a guy like Eddie Shrote has a good side - and a bad side. Now, he's killed and tortured a few people. But then again, you should see his bad side. Now, I try not to judge, but for what he did to you… ...both sides are as good as dead.

[Jackie walks up to Shrote's apartment, with an informant standing next to him along with some tough guys.]

Mobster: Everything okay?

Mobster: What's up?

Abe Hunter: Well you took your sweet time, didn't ya? I'm Abe Hunter. I don't know where the fuck you been? What, you hit traffic, or something? Alright, Shrote's up in his place. He's been there about an hour maybe. Five'll get you ten he won't be expecting no company. Only about five people even know where he lives.

Jackie Estacado: Thanks for the info. Now how do I get in?

Abe Hunter: Listen, ride up in the elevator and go straight in. Follow the stink. You can't fuckin' miss it. Alright, here you go, pal. Okay, so you got the key to Shrote's apartment. The elevator's over there.

[Jackie takes the elevator up to Shrote's apartment. He hums a jolly song and pretends not to notice Jackie. When he gets close Shrote opens fire.]

Edward Shrote: I see you, ya little prick. Estacado! If you weren't such a dumb shit, Jenny might still be alive!

[He runs away trying to shoot. Jackie chases after him.]

Edward Shrote: The whole of the NYPD is behind me. Estacado. Here come my boys, Jackie! Who's got your back?

[The house begins to be shelled from the attack helicopter.]

Policeman: Covering your six, captain! Locked n' loaded n' ready to go, cap! I'm gonna redecorate these walls with your brain! (laughs)

[Jackie goes out on the roof.]

Edward Shrote: Are ya still crying over Jenny?

Darkness: She's dead. Jenny Jenny, Jenny! (nasty laugh)

Policeman: Yeah, that's it! Bring it on!

Policeman: Here he is!

Policeman: Uh-oh!

Policeman: Is someone over there?

Policeman: Do you see what I fucking see?

Policeman: Get the fuck out of here! Move! Move! Now! Now!

Edward Shrote: Jackie Estacado! You are now officially on the NYPD shoot to kill list, by order from me, Captain Edward Shrote! In other words: You are fucking dead!

[Jackie even has to jump off the roof in pursuit of Shrote, but he manages to escape. Jackie goes back down to the subway through the technical entrance.]

Dirty Reputation
Pager: Jackie, I've got someone for me from you. —Butcher

[Jackie quickly finds a pay phone.]

Butcher Joyce: Jesus, Jackie... What the hell did you do to Eddie Shrote? I heard he bolted for his little rabbit hole. Hey, I just got an idea... Eddie's been safe-keeping a suitcase for Paulie. It's full of evidence that can put them both away. If you nab the suitcase, Shrote will definitely come out to get it back. But before you return it, I'd say we prepare it with a little surprise. 

Jackie Estacado: Sounds like a plan. So where's he keepin' this bag of goodies?

Butcher Joyce: Well, as you might expect Eddie and his goons snag a lot of confiscated gods for themselves. They stash most of it in the old Turkish Baths. It's hard to go there, though - if you don't know how. But from Fulton, there's a connection through the old City Hall station. You'll need to get past the gate between Fulton and City Hall. But Shrote's gang makes damn sure it's always locked. However someone whispered in my ear that they keep a key hidden somewhere in the public toilets at Fulton Street Station.

Jackie Estacado: Okay, I am off to grab Paulie and Shrote-fuckers' piece of candy. Thanks Butch.

Butcher Joyce: Be careful, Jackie. Go to the old Turkish baths and get that suitcase. Then meet me at those same public toilets at Fulton Street station. The ones where they keep the key to the gate. I'll be waitin' there for you when you come back.

Vinny Montarello: Estacado! Hey, how you been doin', gavone? It's me! Vinny! Here's the deal… We gotta some old men with their dicks flapping in the breeze and their noses seriously out of joint, you know what I mean? That little schmuck Paulie's gone too far. He's got some fuckin' West Coast assholes doin' all our meaningful labor. Jesus Christ, wo been earners for this family for more years than I care to remember, an' now this?

Jackie Estacado: What do you say I put him over a barrel and show him the true spirit of family loyalty?

Vinny Montarello: I knew we could count on you, Jackie. There's an entire gang of these idiots. We need you to put 'om in the ground… one by one. Now the first one's been tailing your Aunt Sarah… ...but don't think she don't know every move he makes.

[Jackie uses the key and opens the door to the technical corridor.]

Darkness: Ordinary, dull, pointless maggots…

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) This is City Hall. You know, used to be a subway station but it's pretty much went to hell a few years ago. It's the only way through to where I need to go. Back to the motherfuckers will kill you.

[The technical corridor leads him to an abandoned station.]

Darkness: Human misery, suffering, disease of the mind and heart festers here. It's a good place to die.

[Jackie hides his Darkness and puts away his weapon.]

Emerson Darke: Better go back the way you came, pal. Cops shut down the entrance to the old Turkish baths a year ago… 

Chip Feary: ...By special order from Captain Edward Shrote. Dickhead! 

Emerson Darke: That cocksucker Shrote… Stole our best hangout.

Jackie Estacado: Tell me about the Turkish Baths.

Emerson Darke: And you know another thing... We used to have a passage down to the old Baths. Did they close the place down after a couple of old ladies drowned one time. It was the warmest place in the city to sleep on a cold night. That busted Eddie Shrote stole it from us. Hey, good luck gettin' in there, pal. You need a compass an' half a ton of dynamite. Okay, hey… Hey! I wouldn't try goin' in there if I was you! The entrance is blocked. Besides, you don't want to get close to Deval's people.

[Jackie sneaks through crowds of crazies and death traps, which, thanks to his abilities, don't have much trouble.]

Madman: Death to invaders!

Madman: Backward ugly American!

Ernie Deval: He's coming... I knew he would... He knows what I did. Help me, Lord Satan… your humble servant, Ernie Deval… All that I have is yours.

[Jackie finds Ernie.]

Ernie Deval: Help! Heeelp! He's unclean! Unclean!

[A delirious Ernie attacks Jackie.]

Ernie Deval: You lied to me. This wasn't the deal!

[Jackie has to kill him. By eating his heart, Darkness obtains the Black Hole ability, which allows him to create small black holes that suck everything around him. Thanks to his new ability, Jackie manages to break the gate for which he has no key. After walking down the corridor he finds a staircase leading to the Turkish baths.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) These are the old Turkish Baths. Shrote's secret warehouse full of stolen evidence. I got a little birthday surprise waiting for me, courtesy of good old Butcher Joyce. All I gotta do is get through half a legion of bent cops, find that suitcase and bring it back to Butcher.

[As soon as Jackie walks into the baths he immediately starts killing.]

Policeman: This thing goes off more than a robot in a metal detector. This better not be another false alarm.

Policeman: Is someone over there?

Policeman: Stop him from going upstairs!!

Policeman: Jesus... fucking... 89!! Crime against nature!

Policeman: He's here!

Policeman: Goddamnit! One down!

Policeman: Are you serious?

Policeman: Okay.

Policeman: Don't let him near the storage room!

Policeman: Code 30 goddammit!

Policeman: Go back! Go back!

Policeman: Ahh! Holy-fucking-shit!

Policeman: Call dispatch! Tell them we got strange activity!

Policeman: We're doomed!

Darkling: I want to shoot someone.

Policeman: Hey, either we cap his ass or Eddie caps us!

Policeman: Got it.

Policeman: I have a bead on him!

Policeman: We're not alone.

Policeman: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

Policeman: Suspect confirmed.

Darkling: C'mon! Let's kill a Commie! Yes, Sir! Drink this, you asswipe! Affirmative. Enemy Down. Yes, Sir!

Policeman: 34s in fucking progress! Backup! Now!

Policeman: Advance on him!

Policeman: He's tryin' to get to the briefcase!

Policeman: You're mine now asswipe!

Policeman: We got company.

Policeman: They don't pay me enough for this shit!

Policeman: Fuck! Fucking eat this, you fuck fuck!

Policeman: That was fun.

Policeman: Ahh! Holy-fucking-shit!

Policeman: Tango spotted.

[Jackie picks up the suitcase.]

Policeman: I'm outta here!

Anthony Estacado: (whispers) Jackie... I think I got it.

Darkness: It's a lie.

Policeman: Hey fuckhead! You're under arrest!

Policeman: Rise and shine!

Policeman: Holy fuck!

Policeman: Somebody get that briefcase back!

Edward Shrote: (from a helicopter) Jackie, remember me?! Remember Gun Hill?! Jackie, you fuckin' coward! Stay and fight this time! You gonna run away again, Jackie? Drown, you worthless piece of shit. No use resisting, Jackie! You're surrounded! Grow some fuckin' balls, Jackie!

Policeman: Retreat!

Policeman: Stop 'im! Stop 'im!

Policeman: He's in the lower pool area!

Policeman: I see you, asshole!

Policeman: Target is hiding in the second pool area!

Policeman: Don't let him outta your sights!

Edward Shrote: Mayday, mayday! Losing altitude! The fucker got me! I'll see you in hell, Jackieee.

[His helicopter goes down.]

Policeman: Bad guy over here!

Policeman: Fall back! Fall back!

Policeman: Jesus... I feel like I'm chasing ghosts.

Policeman: They don't pay me enough for this shit.

Policeman: Nothing here, as far as I can tell.

Policeman: Holy shit! Get outta the way!

Policeman: Nope. Not even a mouse.

Policeman: Don't let him get away!

Policeman: Bring him in, dead or deader!

Джеки удается сбежать. Он возвращается на заброшенную станцию.

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Now, I know a thing or two about ambushes, having set up most of Paulie's business in that regard for years. So I know when I'm about to be on the receiving end. Eddie's boys are gonna be out here intent on blowing my brains out. These fucking morons must think I was born yesterday.

Emerson Darke: Man... I don't know who you pissed off but you did a fine job. I seen about twenty or thirty cops down there - heavy shit... SWAT an' everything. 

[Jackie continues to explore her surroundings in search of a way out.]

Policeman: Five Charlie Niner... do you have a visual ID at this time?

Policeman: Keep it down. Let him make the first move...

Policeman: This is Ten Adam Six... nothing yet.

Policeman: Stay on it... he's coming.

Policeman: What the hell d'ya bring all these cops around here for? This place was fine 'til you came here.

Policeman: Maintain radio silence.

Policeman: That means don't talk on the radio, dipshit.

Policeman: That's what I'm saying.

Policeman: Yeah... Over the radio.

Policeman: I said, 'fuckin' maintain radio silence.'

Policeman: Are you really that stupid? If you maintain radio silence, you're not supposed to tell everybody over the radio... Moron.

Policeman: Hey! You hear a sound?

Policeman: Nope. Nothin' in sight!

Policeman: I'm not dying for this shit!

Policeman: Yeah, yeah... relax.

[Jackie summons a machine gunner and attacks. He has to go through crowds of cops who need to get Jackie's stolen suitcase by any means necessary.]

Darkling: I want to shoot someone.

Policeman: Watch your back!

Policeman: What the cock?

Policeman: C'mon! Let's kill a Commie!

Policeman: Holy shit! Get outta the way!

Policeman: Careful?

Policeman: Ahh! Holy-fucking-shit!

Policeman: Call dispatch! Tell them we got strange activity!

Policeman: What's that?

Darkling: Tigers!

Policeman: Get outta here! Go back!

Darkling: Hi-yah!

Policeman: Fall back!

Policeman: Get outta here! Go back!

Policeman: Look out, gang.

Darkling: Da, Comrade!

Policeman: Do you see what I fucking see?

Policeman: Aw, shit.

Darkling: Damn right!

Policeman: Fuck! You see this?

Policeman: We gotta big problem.

Darkling: Yeehaw!

Policeman: I have a bead on him!

Policeman: Holy shit! Get outta the way!

Policeman: Watch out!

Darkling: Let me cut someone.

Policeman: This way!

Darkling: I like to squeeze.

Policeman: I'm outta here!

Policeman: Ahh! Holy-fucking-shit!

Policeman: Watch your back!

Darkling: Lemon curd!

Policeman: We're doomed!

Policeman: Why?

Darkling: I am disturbed.

Policeman: Get outta here! Go back!

Policeman: Holy shit! Get outta the way!

Darkling: Ready for action! Yes, Sir! Who goes there?

Policeman: You're under arrest, shit-for-brains!

Policeman: Tango is D.O.A.

Darkling: That felt good. A-ok! Affirmative.

Policeman: Don't let him get away!

Policeman: Fuck!

Policeman: Hey shithead... take a dive!

Policeman: Hey, Estacado! No hard feelings, huh?

Policeman: I see you, asshole!

Policeman: Take him down!

Policeman: They don't pay me enough for this shit!

Policeman: Watch your back!

Policeman: This blows.

[Jackie manages to escape the hellish trap and return to the technical corridor of the subway.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) "Fight fire with fire," that's what I always say. My Uncle Paulie always goes for the spectacular when he's breaking somebody's balls. Let's see how he likes it when I do the same to his main man, Eddie.

Darkness: Human flesh sustenance for such as us. This is where you are... where you will remain.

[On his way out of the technical corridor, Jackie meets Mitch, who asked to look for his brother.]

Mitch Deval: Say, did you see my brother?

Jackie Estacado: Well, I saw him, but I think he's kinda reluctant to meet up with you. He's got serious people problems.

Mitch Deval: Oh... my brother Ernie's always been the family freak. Hey, but thanks for trying. Here.

Hellish Church
[Jackie goes to the men's room where he meets Butcher.]

Butcher Joyce: Well, you stirred up a hornet's nest, Jackie, make no mistake. Your Uncle Paulie had big plans for that briefcase. I'd imagine they'll be calling any second now. But first, I'm gonna put a bomb in that suitcase.

Jackie Estacado: Okay.

Butcher Joyce: There you go. Like clockwork.

Pager: Alright you fucking bastard, let's talk —Shrote

Butcher Joyce: You're setting the rules now, Jackie. You decide when and where you meet Eddie. Just be careful. He didn't get this far in life by being stupid.

[Jackie comes out of the bathroom and walks to a pay phone.]

Woman: A'ight. Check this, D! You go girl!

Edward Shrote: (via phone) You fucking piece of shit! Do you know what you've done? I got twenty pissed off people from East coast to West because of you. I want that fucking briefcase back! Where are you?

Jackie Estacado: Wow, Eddie... I didn't know you cared.

Edward Shrote: (via phone) Don't push your luck, Estacado. I am warning you. And don't call me Eddie!

Jackie Estacado: What, you're gonna kill me? I'm shakin'.

Edward Shrote: (via phone) I can do worse, Jackie. I seem to recall your lady-friend's face exploding. Just tell me a place.

Jackie Estacado: Trinity Church. Bring fifty grand in unmarked bills and come alone.

[Jackie gets on the train and goes to meet Eddie.]

Jackie Estacado: Used to be the only person I cared about was you. Now, the only person care about is Eddie Shrote. Him and my Uncle Paulie. You just hang in there, Eddie. I didn't forget
about you.

[Jackie gets off the subway and walks to the cemetery.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Luck isn't just luck. It's "preparation meets opportunity." Well, I got my opportunity. Jury's out on whether or not I'm really prepared. One thing I know for sure: this is my path to the men who killed you. There's no way in Hell anyone can stop me from paying them back - for what they did.

[Along the way, he sees a ghost.]

Ghost of Anthony Estacado: (whispers) Hey kid. I think I just figured it out.

Darkness: No! Jackie is mine. Let me have him.

Ghost of Anthony Estacado: You can control the Darkness. Here in no-man's-land. You gotta work out how to get back.

Darkness: Don't get any ideas now Jackie.

[Jackie opens the gates of the church.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) The trenches. See, they weren't inside my mind. I was inside the mind of the Darkness. That's where it's vulnerable. It's where I gotta go back. That means I gotta top myself again, but this time… ...I'm gonna take Eddie fuckin' Shrote along with me for a ride.

Darkness: Why this place? Filthy church!

[Jackie sees into the main hall with the altar. Eddie stands on the second floor.]

Edward Shrote: Well, I see you came alone. I knew you'd keep your word, Jackie-boy. And I see you brought my stuff, just like you promised. Go ahead - put it on the altar. Nice and slow.

[Jackie puts the suitcase on the altar.]

Edward Shrote: Yeah, that's what I love about criminals. You can always be relied on to make the dumbest mistakes possible. Like they train you guys to be dipshits on command. Kendal! Turn off the lights!

[The hall lights go out and Jackie is attacked on all sides by corrupt police officers.]

Policeman: He's here!

Policeman: Hey, Estacado!

Policeman: Take that, you little Italian queer!

Policeman: Holy shit! Get outta the way!

Edward Shrote: I really liked that little girl of yours. Jenny was it? My favorite part was the look on your face... ...when we spray-canned her brains all over the window. You make sure you give her my regards when you see her. You hear me?

Policeman: Stand still, you little Guinea piece of shit.

Policeman: Attention!

Policeman: Fuck!

Policeman: Go back! Go back!

Policeman: Eddie! He's tearin' us apart!

Edward Shrote: Well, turn the damn floodlights on! He can't do that shit in the light! AND DON’T FUCKIN’ CALL ME EDDIE!

[The cops turn on some spotlights. Jackie calls for Darkling with a machine gun, while he tries to stay in the shadows.]

Policeman: What was that noise?

Darkling: Let me cut someone.

[Jackie kills cops shooting from the second floor.]

Policeman: We got a bogey.

Policeman: He’s mine!

Policeman: Ain't so cocky now, you little sonovabitch?

Policeman: Do yourself a favor an' give up now!

Policeman: Watch out!

Policeman: Hey shithead... take a dive!

Policeman: Take cover!

Policeman: He’s ours now!

Policeman: Rise and shine!

Policeman: Got some problems here?

[Jackie kills all the cops in the church.]

Darkling: Enemy disengaged, Sir!

Edward Shrote: You think you can get away with this, Jackie? Killin' my people like they're nothing. I bet you feel like a tough guy. pulin' those tricks in the dark.

Darkling: Doctor Scurrilous!

Edward Shrote: Well it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out your weakness.

[He throws some blinding grenades on the lower floor. Jackie loses consciousness.]

Darkness: Wake up!

[Jackie wakes up tied to a chair. He is illuminated by a bright spotlight. Eddie’s standing next to him in his police uniform. He's kneading his knuckles.]

Edward Shrote: Welcome back to the land of the living. But don't get used to it. (punch) Okay, now tell me… (punch) Who helped you out on the hit at the Turkish Baths? Aw, what's the matter? Helpless without that screwy shit you been pullin' in the darkness? Too light here, isn't it? 

Policeman: Huhuh... Yeah, scumbag.

Edward Shrote: You're mine now.

Policeman: ...low-life.

Edward Shrote: Ah, let's get creative. You don't have to talk. I'm gonna have fun either way. Go get me that power-drill.

Policewoman: Sure thing, Eddie.

Edward Shrote: It ain’t Eddie, you fuckin' moron! It's Captain Shrote!

Policewoman: Ah, shit. Sorry... Sure thing, Captain Shrote!

Edward Shrote: Now I'm gonna tell you how this works. You tell me who helped you out on the hit at the Turkish Baths, you tell me who saw the briefcase, you play ball, an' you'll die quickly. Otherwise, you get little holes drilled in the pain centers of your brain. And believe me, I've done this work before. You may think you're a tough kid, but you don't want to go that second route. You know ya made Paulie real nervous. That little turd is so paranoid I gotta keep him in a safe place until the heat dies down. Now say your prayers.. "Holy Mary, Mother of God. Pray for us sinners now and at..."

Policeman: Ha! 'Mother of God.’ Thať's a good one, boss. I mean, considerin' the shipment we got comin' in…

Edward Shrote: Well, don't tell him, you stupid shit!

Policeman: What's the difference? Who's he gonna tell? Won't make any difference if he knows about the.. You said we was gonna waste him.

Edward Shrote: Oh yeah, we're gonna waste him. And if you say one more word about Mother of God we're gonna waste you next!

Policeman: Alright... Easy, alright alright alright…

[The policewoman brings Eddie the drill.]

Policewoman: Here you go.

Edward Shrote: Now then... You may feel a little discomfort…

[However, the wire is a little short to reach Jackie's head. Eddie is furious and pulls the wire and rips it out of the socket.]

Edward Shrote: Fuck… Shit... Goddamnit! Why'dya plug it in all the way over there?... Jesus Christ. Goddamnit I'll do it myself.

[He slowly goes to plug in the drill, cursing hard on the way.]

Edward Shrote: Now.... Where were we? Oh yeah…

[He drills a hole in Jackie's head, but then the drill breaks down.]

Edward Shrote: Chinese piece of shit!

[He goes off to fix the drill. Jackie laughs quietly.]

Jackie Estacado: (to the policemen in an eerie voice) Come over here. The light's in my eyes. I need some shade.

Policewoman: You caused us a lot of trouble, Estacado. You know how long it's gonna take us to repair all the damage you done?

Darkness: Ah, dark bliss…

Jackie Estacado: (in an eerie voice) You'll die before you realize what I'm up to.

Policewoman: I seen a man die of shock one time - before the drill even touched his skull. Lucky son-of-a-bitch.

Darkness: Display your power.

Jackie Estacado: Keep lickin Eddie's ass, ya cunts. Polish his sweet butt-crack.

Policeman: Boy, you sure did put the cat among the pigeons, Estacado. You know what I'm saying? That means you fucked everything up. Why? Now we gotta do what we gotta do. You! That's it, that's all we gotta do. Forget it.

Darkness: Yes, darkness.

Jackie Estacado: You're fuckin' hilarious. You think fuck-face Eddie could ever make me talk?

Policewoman: Man he messed up your face. I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes, boy.

[Jackie uses the power of Darkness to detonate the bomb in the suitcase.]

Darkness: No! Stupid puppet!

[The frame freezes. We hear a voiceover.]

Jackie Estacado: (offscreen) And that… That was the second time I died.

The Second Time I Died
Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) I'm inside its mind. My guess is the Darkness has never been controlled and it's not about to change. Means I gotta move fast before it finds a way to stop me. I'm a little rabbit trying to stop a runaway train.

[Jackie returns to the train cabin as if he had never left it.]

Darkness: Death awaits you. Worse than death.

[The train stops in front of a blockage. Jackie tries to fire the cannon, but the handle doesn't move.]

German Soldier: The master will kill us!

Darkness: Again you fail. Worthless host. (laughs)

[Jackie gets off the train to deal with the problem himself. He finds the half-decomposed corpse of a British soldier without a leg at the station.]

British Soldier: It is no use, old chap. Won't without a shell. You need to find one... somewhere else.

Darkness: You are without hope.

[Jackie goes to retrieve a shell through crowds of abstract German soldiers.]

Darkness: This is the wrong way.

[Jackie emerges through the tunnels to a village where British soldiers are based.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) I never felt like I needed much. Place to sleep. food and drink. Maybe a piece for protection. I need a cannon shell. Need a little hope. I need to know why the Darkness is lying to me. I need to see you again.

Frances Fox: Well done old chap. If His Majesty's can ever be of service, don't hesitate to ask.

Jackie Estacado: I need to find Anthony Estacado. You know where he went?

Frances Fox: Well, it's all a bit hectic and whatnot. The Yank went off to the trenches. He said he was expecting you, said he was getting things ready... Sorry, it's all I can remember.

Darkness: Ignore him. They hate you, Jackie. They always lie.

[Jackie climbs down the stairs to the sewers and walks to the trenches.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Did you ever hear a scream and realize it was you? Not you... Something inside you. Something that has no right to be there. I hear the Darkness, crying foul because it knows I'm about to gain control. Because it's afraid.

Anthony Estacado: Finally! You're back! You got the Darkness running scared, Jackie! I can sense it in the air! Get on to the tank, Jackie. Man the gun, I'm driving. We got some payback to deliver.

[Jackie climbs into the cockpit and they drive the tank over the uneven ground from the constant bombing. Along with Anthony, Jackie destroys tanks and helicopters on the battlefield.]

Anthony Estacado: Here we go! Take it outta the sky! We got company! Coming down from upstairs! Krauts at three-o-clock! Go for the tank! Eyes right, Jackie! Look right! They're coming in from the right!

[They drive into a German base. Jackie destroys the bunkers.]

Anthony Estacado: Message from Estacado, Fritzie! Alright, there she blows! That was too close. Jackie. I can’t brake! Nine o-clock! Stay sharp! Snipers! I hate snipers! Aw, that's right. No brakes. Ah, shit! I think we're almost there!

[They crash into the gates of the German citadel. The tank overturns. Anthony approaches Jackie, trapped in the cockpit of the machine gun.]

Anthony Estacado: Man… I thought we were goners there for sure. Goddam tank almost crushed my spine. You don't look so good, Jackie. I’ll go find something to get you outta here. Don't go anywhere kid.

[He steps away from the tank and hears the eerie roar of some creature. Anthony squats down and walks away quietly.]

Anthony Estacado: Hey! Over here you ugly bastard!

[Jackie hears the sounds of a fierce struggle.]

Anthony Estacado: Come one! You want him? You gotta take me first! Get away from him you ugly piece of shit! I'm the one that brought this on our family! You think I'm afraid of you? I've been here too long to be afraid! Go back to hell!

[The creepy creature throws Anthony against the wall, then grabs the tank. Jackie opens fire with a machine gun. A short time later, the creature dies. Jackie runs to Anthony, leaving a terrible bloody trail on the ground.]

Anthony Estacado: Oh... That was a ride, huh? I think I see it, Jackie. I know what went wrong with the Darkness. All those years alone to think… It lived a thousand lifetimes, and it just went insane… It was us, see? We're the big mistake... Oh... God..I can feel something inside me… It's moving… Don't forget me, kid.. It’s okay… (coughs) I've been waiting to die for centuries… I knew I was losing my mind... But I see it better now… Everything's changing… You're the one, Jackie... You were always supposed to be the one. Hey, kid… I think I got it… That thing about the light in the darkness… You know what that means?

Darkness: Do not interfere.

[The darkness causes a small earthquake and Anthony falls somewhere down.]

Darkness: Only the darkness will prevail.

[Jackie begins to explore the citadel of the German army.]

Darkness: You’ll be alone forever, Jackie.

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) What if you get to the end of the line? I mean, what then? Maybe there is a way out - and I just can't find it yet. Or maybe it's through here - in the heart of the Darkness. Or maybe I'm just walking into a trap.

[Jackie finds a huge shell on a transport wagon and gets on it. The wagon is equipped with a machine gun. Jackie leaves the hangar and heads for the train, firing off planes along the way.]

Darkness: Please, Jackie… this is a mistake, Jackie.

[Jackie rides the wagon up to the train, which is already surrounded by German soldiers. After killing them all, he climbs into the cab of the train.]

Darkness: I beg you reconsider.

[After loading the cannon, Jackie dashingly presses the projectile launch button. The rubble turns to dust.]

Darkness: I’ll destroy you.

[Since there are no rails further away, Jackie has to walk.]

Darkness: I’ll put your teeth to the grindstone. I’ll tear your mind. I’ll boil your eyes.

[Ignoring the threats, Jackie walks on over the thin, flimsy bridge to the Citadel of Darkness, its heart.]

Darkness: Turn back or you lose Jenny forever. I can take you to her. Your heart's desire.

[Jackie keeps going.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) This is the heart of the Darkness. It's where the creature dwells. I think... this is the end of the line.

[Jackie enters a room with several corpses tied to chairs.]

Darkness: Nothing for you here.

[Jackie gives the Darkness Guns to one of the corpses, putting them in his hands.]

Darkness: Stay away, Jackie!

[Jackie tries to sit down on one of the vacant chairs. He screams in terror and quickly gets up from it.]

Darkness: No! Must not! This is not for you.

[He uses two other chairs, which turn out to be extractors. What they do is not entirely clear, but Jackie sits in them anyway. When he uses all the chairs, the corpse at the far end of the room turns into himself.]

Other Jackie: Jackie! This is not a place you can bend to your will. You insulted my legacy! Now we have to teach you a lesson!

[They fight. Other Jackie can use the same abilities that Jackie himself has, but experience is as always more important than tools.]

Other Jackie: This is not your life anymore! Surrender to the Darkness. 

Whisper of Jenny: Fighting only makes it stronger. Find another way.

Darkness: This is my world.

Other Jackie: You don't belong here.

Darkness: No! Cannot! Must not!

[Jackie absorbs the Other Jackie.]

Darkness: No!

[The screen goes dark.]

Darkness: I am yours to control… for now. But Jackie… with each life you take I grow closer to owning your soul.

The Boat to the Underworld
[Jackie returns to the world of the living. He was awakened by the ghost of little Jenny.]

Ghost of Jenny: Jackie Estacado! Wake up! Catch me if you can! (laughs and runs away)

[Jackie gets to his feet. He finds himself outside a burnt-out orphanage. As he walks outside he hears a black man and woman talking.]

Man: You know what would be neat? If people had flying cars.

Woman: It would also be neat if I had a clue what you were talking about.

Man: I'm just saying, "where's my flying car?” I thought we'd have them by now.

Woman: They're called planes.

Man: No, I mean a car you could park in your garage. Now, when I was a kid I was going to invanta flying car.

Woman: So why didn't you?

Man: Well, I got sidetracked.

[Jackie goes down to the subway.]

Vinny Mortarello: Jackie? Jackie Estacado? Is that you? Holy Mother of Pearl, Jackie - everyone thought you was dead! We heard you flamed out the same time as that cocksucker Eddie Shrote. That's one hell of a stunt you pulled. Where you been hidin'?

Jackie Estacado: I spent a couple of weeks in a dark place. You wouldn't understand.

Vinny Mortarello: Mystery man, huh? Well you sure made some waves, son. The Chicago boys are considerin' pullin' the plug on your, dear old Uncle Paulie. He's on his knees ready to suck whatever dick he can so they won't freeze his assets. He's holed up. Not even Butcher knows where.

Jackie Estacado: Shrote's people mentioned "Mother of God". Now, I think it had somethin’ to do with the administration in Chicago. You know anything about that?

Vinny Mortarello: Uhm, strange. He and Paulie got religious? Run the name with Butcher. He's gonna shit in his breeches when you show up. You're supposed to be dead. So go see Butcher. Should be over Aunt Sarah's. He's helpin' her out with some stuff or some shit, I don't know…

[Jackie gets on the train and goes to her aunt's house.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) There's something coming... Maybe it's that eclipse they were talking about on the news? The air just feels weird. Whatever it is, it's big. I feel like a penguin trying to stop a runaway polar bear.

Dorothy Paine: I was poking around, you know the Lower East Side as Iwant to do, as my husband Harry is always teasing me... Anyway… Then I went by the harbor a few hours ago. And the wind is just picking up. You think it has to do with that eclipse thing?

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) The Mother of God thing was way too obvious. I figured it had to be something else. Now, I knew that Aunt Sarah and Butcher were ready to see Shrote and Paulie's asses on a platter. I’ve already got an opening. Maybe they can help turn it into a gaping hole.

[He gets off the subway and walks up to his aunt's house. When he rings the doorbell, she instantly runs up to the door.]

Aunt Sarah: Jackie... you're still alive! Oh, thank the Lord.

Butcher Joyce: Holy catfish… Jackie? Jackie! Is that you?

Aunt Sarah: This problem with your Uncle Paulie has gone on long enough, Jackie. It's time to take action. I think the decision has just about made itself anyway, what with the way he's been carrying on. Some old friends of the family want to know what they can do to help. 

Jackie Estacado: Eddie Shrote's guy said something about the Mother of God. It was supposed to be an… ...inside joke but it meant something. I think there's some kind of connection to the Chicago Families… ...Something Paulie wants to keep to himself.

Aunt Sarah: The Mother of God... Like the Virgin Mary? You don't suppose he's talking about the Santa Maria?

Butcher Joyce: That's a Chicago family boat... It's been running shipments of drugs into the harbor for years. Knowing Eddie, he wouldn't resist the chance to talk about it to a dying man. He always did have diarrhea of the mouth. Especially if there's something big going on. The Chicago Families are gonna be real interested in what happens here, Jackie. This is gonna be your best chance to get Paulie out of the picture for good. Just say the word and I'll help if I can.

Jackie Estacado: I want to know more about this Santa Maria, Butch. Anything there I can use against Paulie?

Butcher Joyce: Listen, Jackie - I would never normally say this.. you know me, I never choose sides. But you already put a hole in Paulie's finances when you took out Dutch Oven Harry's operation. You put a few holes in that boat Santa Maria, the Chicago families gonna pull the plug… ...and Paulie'll find himself swimming to the bottom of the river.

Jackie Estacado: I need to know how to mess up Paulie's deal.

Butcher Joyce: They've got people inside the Coast Guard. They usually wait for the coast to clear… ...and they call the Santa Maria in from the harbor to make a shipment. There's a radio they use, down at Grinder's Lane… tuned to the correct frequency at all times. You get to that radio and call in, they'll send the boat.

Aunt Sarah: Now, you do what Butcher says. The boat's name is "Santa Maria". You should go to Grinder's Lane and find that radio.

[Jackie leaves his aunt's house and goes down to the subway.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) I knew a guy that worked down here one time. Yeah, Mickey Fat Lips. Weird son-of-a-bitch. Used to collect subway tokens and feed 'em to his cat. Used to say. "Jackie, here. Try one. They're a good source of iron." Stupid fuck.

[Jackie arrives at Grinder's Lane.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) During the war, they used to have this saying… ..."Loose lips sink ships." Now I know what they mean and soon the Chicago families will now too. All I need is that radio to call in their boat.

Paulie’s Mafioso: Is someone over there?

Paulie’s Mafioso: This is getting weirder by the moment!

Paulie’s Mafioso: What the hell?

Darkness: This is the right way! Kill more!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Peekaboo motherfucker!

Darkling: Hmm… not bad.

Paulie’s Mafioso: There's nowhere to run, Estacado.

Darkling: I need some action.

Paulie’s Mafioso: He's right goddamn here!

Paulie’s Mafioso: That cannot be real!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Aw fuck! Shoot!

Paulie’s Mafioso: This is fucked!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Put him down!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Hey, Jackie! How's it feel to be on the outs?

Paulie’s Mafioso: He ain't getting away this time.

Paulie’s Mafioso: Better make peace with your Maker, Estacado!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Got anything left in you, you prick?

Paulie’s Mafioso: You fucked your family, Jackie!

[Jackie finds the radio in the workshop where he once found a can of gasoline to burn Pailie's money.]

Radio: This is Captain Andre Kuchev of the Santa Maria. What's the story? Over.

Jackie Estacado: You can bring in the boat. Everything's clear. Over.

Radio: Affirmative. We're coming in.

[When Jackie comes out of the workshop, a car with a mobster drives into the meatpacking plant.]

Paulie’s Mafioso: Hey, what the hell was that?

Paulie’s Mafioso: This is fuckin' insane!

Darkness: Kill them all!

[Jackie shoots them all with two UZIs.]

Pager: Jackie, I got some information for you. —Butcher

Jackie goes down to the subway. As he stands on the platform waiting for the train, he notices an old woman looking at the tracks. She approaches him.

Ingrid Pulanski: Ai Borja… (Oh God…) I'm certain it's here somewhere. I dropped it right around here. 

Jackie Estacado: Better give it up an' go home, lady, before you fall on the tracks an' kill yourself.

[His train approaches the station and he boards it.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Hey, you know why the New York subway was invented? Alright, I'll tell you. It was a group of tunnels they used for smuggling Italian immigrants. Well, that's what Jimmy the Grape told me one time.

[Jackie finds a pay phone and calls Butcher.]

Butcher Joyce: (via phone) That's the spirit kid! Now you listen to me. That boat "Santa Maria"? Waiting for you down at Pier 19. You put a few holes in that boat, and the Chicago people will get Paulie out of the picture for good. You need to put a bullet right between the boat captain's eyes. Go take care of business now kid!

Darkness: Come… Embrace the darkness.

[Jackie walks through the tunnel to the pier.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) A job's not worth doing… ...unless you do it right. Paulie's a dead man unless he grows a beard and learns how to speak Swahili. Oh, he won't get that chance. Not for as long as I draw breath.

[As Jackie emerges from the tunnel he hears the voices of the mobsters.]

Paulie’s Mafioso: I’m there because Paulie Franchetti tells me where I gotta be. So when he tells me to watch out for his "Mother of God" boat, or whatever, that's what I do. 

Paulie’s Mafioso: No, you fuckin’ dipshit. I mean, "Did you hear about Ernie Palanco?"

Paulie’s Mafioso: Oh, right. I get it.

Paulie’s Mafioso: Well?

Paulie’s Mafioso: No, I ain’t heard nothin’.

Paulie’s Mafioso: Well, get this... The other day Paulie sends Palanco to rub out Timmy the Nose, right?

[Jackie attacks them. A firefight ensues.]

Paulie’s Mafioso: There you are!

Paulie’s Mafioso: I got a problem over here!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Let's make a deal okay Jackie? Let's just call it a draw and walk away okay?

Paulie’s Mafioso: Hey, you... I see you, asshole! You're one of Paulie's boys!

Darkling: Die, sucker! Got it.

[After killing everyone on the pier, Jackie boards the Santa Maria. An alarm is sounded on the ship.]

Santa Maria Crew: Take him down!

Santa Maria Crew: Shit fuck!

Santa Maria Crew: Intruders detected. I repeat. Intruders detected!

Santa Maria Crew: He’s here now.

Santa Maria Crew: What the fuck? Whose body is that?

Santa Maria Crew: He's surrounded.

Santa Maria Crew: Alright, we know where he is!

Santa Maria Crew: Watch out!

Santa Maria Crew: I'm getting the fuck out of here.

Santa Maria Crew: This is fuckin’ insane!

Darkness: Relinquish all control.

Santa Maria Crew: What the hell…!?

Santa Maria Crew: He's around here somewhere.

Loudspeaker: Paulie Franchetti's men are trying to steal the cargo. Give 'em hell!

Santa Maria Crew: Hey, what the fuck was that?

Santa Maria Crew: Eyes over here!

Santa Maria Crew: Fuck!

Santa Maria Crew: Take him from there! 

Loudspeaker: We know who you are, asshole!

Santa Maria Crew: Go down the side!

Santa Maria Crew: Fuck this, I'm taking off!

Loudspeaker: You think the Chicago people are gonna let this slide?

Santa Maria Crew: Come to papa.

Santa Maria Crew: Don’t kill me! I’m unarmed! I’m not worth it!

Loudspeaker:Now tell Uncle Paulie he's finished, you hear me?

Santa Maria Crew: He’s too much!

Santa Maria Crew: He's rippin' us to shreds!

[Finally Jackie comes out on the bridge.]

Captain: You tell Uncle Paulie that he is dead fucking meat!

[Jackie brutally kills him. After that, he destroys the controls of the ship.]

Darkness: Good! Let go.

Loudspeaker: They killed the Captain. Don't let 'em leave this ship! All hands on station! Make ready for immediate departure.

Pager: Paulie’s gone crazy. Under attack. Help us!!! —Sarah

Darkness: Punish them.

[Paulie's men left on the pier are hungry for Jackie's blood.]

Paulie’s Mafioso: Motherfucker won't go down!

Paulie’s Mafioso: End of the line, Jackie!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Нou’re dead, motherfucker!

Darkness: Exquisite meat.

Paulie’s Mafioso: He's tippin us to shreds!

[Jackie fights his way to the tunnel and hides in its darkness.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) Now that Paulie's found out that the old crew's on my side, it’s like some snake bit him on the heel. Next thing I know, I got Jimmy the Grape an' everybody, all holed up at my Aunt Sarah's place… ...while Paulie's boys crawling over them like stink on shit. I guess maybe this is what I wanted all along: The opportunity to impress.

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) You know, I never thought I'd last as long doing this. Always figured some guy would… ...sneak up on me in the middle of the night… ...and shoot me in the back. Guess I'm just really fuckin' lucky.

[Jackie sneaks up on him and shoots him in the back. After that, he kills the rest of Paulie's men, who are besieging his aunt's house.]

Stand Your Ground
Nicky Barruci: Yo, Estacado. Come on!

[Together they defend the house against Paulie's men, constantly arriving. It looks more like a military conflict than a gunfight.]

Aunt Sarah: I think I'm enjoying this... 

Jimmy the Grape: I got a little something for you, Jackie!

Aunt Sarah: (reloading) My Jimmy would never have stood for this. And neither will I.

Darkness: Feed my power.

Jimmy the Grape: Don't let them little punks get away with this, you hear me. Don't let them get away with this! Whatever happened to common decency? Whatever happened to honor amongst our kind, huh? You think you can shoot straight, huh? You little fucking jerk-off you.

Aunt Sarah: You've got to do something, Jackie. Whatever happened to respect? Disgusting behavior. Just disgusting.

Jimmy the Grape: Paulie really crossed the fucking line this time.

Aunt Sarah: This will never do.

Nicky Barruci: Oh darn. All out of ammo. Guess I'm done for.

Darkness: Kill them. Kill them all!

Jimmy the Grape: The Chicago people are really gonna break his fucking ass this time they find out what happened here.

Paulie’s Mafioso: I've had up to here with this asshole!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Fuck him up!

Aunt Sarah: Oh God, why won't they leave?

Paulie’s Mafioso: Aim before you shoot people!

Aunt Sarah: This is beyond the pale.

Paulie’s Mafioso: I hit him! I swear I hit him!

Aunt Sarah: If they don't leave on their own right now, we'll show them the door.

Paulie’s Mafioso: There's nowhere to run. Estacado.

Jimmy the Grape: That's it, that’s it! Give these little scumbags what you got!

Darkness: Darkness will fall.

[Finally they manage to kill all the attackers. Butcher arrives. He enters the house and picks up the closet that acted as a barrier.]

Butcher Joyce: I don't think much of the redecorating job, Jackie. It's the work of Paulie's rat bastard, backstabbing motherfuckers. I am glad to see you're all in one piece. And the Chicago people... they're gonna be grateful that you protected your Aunt Sarah. They'll owe you a great debt. Paulie, on the other hand... Okay, I've got a lead for you. I think I know where Paulie Franchetti's been keeping himself. Paulie paid for an old lighthouse to be renovated last year. He's out there, hoping to Hell you don't find him. You can only get there by boat.

Jimmy The Grape: You got balls, kid. You really got balls. And you got brains. Listen... ...me and some of the old guys, we been talkin' the other day. And we were saying that someone like you with brains, balls and respect. And someone who honors the old ways. You know what the "old ways" mean, don't ya? 'Cause there ain't nothin' but the old ways. So what we want - we want for you to come in and take over the family. Just for a little while. Huh? You like that? C'mon, this way you be the guy. You be - the Don. Sure... as long as it doesn't interfere with my day job.

Butcher Joyce: That's the spirit, kid. But don't let it go to your head, huh? Get this straight: there's a boat waiting for you down at Pier 19. Mario's there. Hell take you out to the lighthouse, okay? You ain't home yet.

End of the Line
[Jackie returns to the pier. The bodies have already been moved away, the mobsters have fled, and there's only one police car and a couple of cops at the loading crane.]

Policeman: You know what I hate? Fucking donuts!... Just kidding.

[Jackie approaches them.]

Policewoman: Back off, pigdick!

[A boat comes up to the pier.]

Darkness: Soon, Jackie…

Mario Del Arte: Yo, Estacado! It's me. Mario Del Arte! Butcher sent me to take you to Paulie's mansion.

Jackie Estacado: I’m ready.

Mario Del Arte: Okay, get in.

[They are sailing at full speed toward the mansion.]

Jackie Estacado: (in the darkness) End of story. Except I'm not the one linin' up for the last rites. It's my lovin' Uncle Paulie. He knows the end of the story as well as I do... but he don't like it as much. You know what I say to that? Fuck ‘im.

Mario Del Arte: I seen that stupid prick shovel a whole mountain of shit into some good friggin' people. Dealin’ with the dope-heads an’ sellin’ out to the cops. You take Paulie Franchetti out, I’ll be right behind you. You remember me, right? Mario Del Arte?

[He's sailing away. It's a bright, sunny day outside. Jackie goes out to kill.]

Darkness: The sun shall fall into darkness.

Paulie’s Mafioso: One clean shot an' he's dead.

Paulie’s Mafioso: Fuckin A-right!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Go gettim, boys!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Jackie! Stick out your ugly fat face! I wanna take a picture!

Paulie’s Mafioso: You need shootin’ lessons boy!

Paulie’s Mafioso: He's as good as dead.

Darkness: More dead is better. Feed me with murder.

Paulie’s Mafioso: Shit fuck, cock!

Darkness: Do not stop!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Spray the bastard!

Darkness: Kill them all. Succumb to darkness. Kill them. Relinquish all control.

[Jackie approaches the mansion, treading on the corpses of enemies who are fighting for every corridor.]

Paulie’s Mafioso: What the fuck…?!

Paulie’s Mafioso: Burn his ass!

[Jackie walks into the mansion. An image of a dead Jenny with empty eyes appears before his eyes. After that, everything fades into darkness.]

Darkness: My time. As was prophesied.

[The Darkness takes control of Jackie's body and kills the mobsters defending the entrance to the main entrance in a few tentacle strokes.]

Darkness: I grow strong upon you, Jackie.

[The Darkness continues to kill mercilessly and methodically.]

Darkness: Show me what you can do with my powers. Behold, vessel! Let me… (nasty laughs) Yours is the power of darkness.

[The massacre continues.]

Darkness: Now I show you my power.

[The Darkness, disregarding the shot, grabs the helicopter and hurls it at the mobster.]

Darkness: Now, it should be my will only. Can you feel it? Your rage feeds our power. I make us invincible. Look.

[The Darkness summons a massive black hole, destroying part of the mansion and killing a dozen mobsters.]

Darkness: Make them fear you.

[The Darkness stops controlling Jackie's body. He goes after Paulie, killing the remaining mobsters.]

Darkness: All control of the vessel is mine.

[The Darkness corners several mobsters. They beg for mercy.]

Darkness: We are the stuff of nightmares.

[The lights go out. From the sounds of it, the Mafiosi die a long and gruesome death.]

Darkness: You like the blood, don’t you?

[Control of the body returns to Jackie. He sees a pile of mutilated corpses without an arm or a leg. One of the mobsters turns out to be alive…]

Paulie’s Mafioso: This is not happening… No. Please... Jackie... Come on! We've been through so much together, man.

[Jackie shoots him in the head and goes looking for Paulie. Some of the mobsters lying around the mansion moan in pain and die in agony…]

Paulie’s Mafioso: Oh, please… Please, just let me live… 

Paulie’s Mafioso: I'll do anything... Please take him…

Paulie’s Mafioso: I told you I don't know anything…

[He finds his dear uncle at the stairs to the top of the lighthouse.]

Paulie Francetti: You think you made a difference here, Estacado? Nothing's changed, you fuckin' piker! You brought this on by yourself, Jackie. I didn't do shit that you didn't do yourself!

[Jackie corners him on top of the lighthouse.]

Paulie Francetti: The problem with you is, you never learned how to listen. You always wanted to be me. It doesn't work that way, Jackie! You're a dead man! You hear me? A dead man!

Darkness: This is the last one. Finish him.

Paulie Francetti: You got somethin', kid - that stuff with the dark is a neat trick. But you don't have what it takes to capitalize.

[Paulie tries to shoot at Jackie, but... he easily dodges and knocks Paulie down with a few shots.]

Paulie Francetti: Ahhh… ehh… Listen, Jackie. I been thinkin'. I know this worked out bad for both of us, but there's no need to be rash here… Why don't you fuckin' listen to me. you piece of shit!

Darkness: When he dies, I own you. Take his life so then I can take yours.

Paulie Francetti: Estacado, you fuckin' piece of shit! I hope you rot in Hell forever.

[He dies from the wounds.]

Darkness: Now you are mine… Mine!

[Jackie's eyes are covered with a black veil.]

Jackie Estacado: And that… ....was the end of the line.

[After a few moments, the screen goes white.]

Voice of Jenny: There's always a little light in the darkness. Didn't I tell you so, sweets?

[Jackie and Jenny find themselves in the park, sitting on a bench. Or rather, Jenny is sitting, and Jackie is lying with his head on her lap. It's like he's waking up.]

Jackie Estacado: Jenny?

Jenny Romano: We get one moment, Jackie. It’s all they can allow.

Jackie Estacado: What?... Who?

Jenny Romano: Just one moment. Just to say goodbye.

Jackie Estacado: You were everything to me… ...and all I ever did was kill you. I’m so sorry. I’m sorry. 

Jenny Romano: I can’t forgive you, Jackie. How can I forgive you when it wasn't your fault? You have to go now.

Jackie Estacado: I don't wanna go. I wanna stay here with you.

Jenny Romano: I know.

[They sit in silence for a few minutes.]

Jackie Estacado: Am I dreaming?

Jenny Romano: Yes. You have to wake up now. Wake up…

THE END
