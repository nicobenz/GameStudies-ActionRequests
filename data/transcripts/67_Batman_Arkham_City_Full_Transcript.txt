[The game begins with a wide shot at the painting "Cain and Abel. The Duality." The painting hangs in the house of some rich man who’s been robbed by Two-Face henchmen. One of them moves the painting away and finds a safe behind it.]

Henchman 1: Look what I found!

Henchman 2: Don’t touch it, man. He’ll kill you!

Henchman 3: How long till the Boss gets here?

Henchman 4: He’ll be here.

Henchman 5: Riley said he saw the Bat. Is he here too?

[The shadow of Batman’s mask appears on the floor, but it quickly disappears.]

Henchman 4: In Arkham City? Why would he come here? You guys just need to chill the hell out.

[A window breaks.]

Henchman 3: It’s Batman!

[A woman enters the room...]

Henchman 4: What the hell?!

Catwoman: Sorry to disappoint you, boys. It’s just little ol’ me.

[She quickly deals with the henchmen.]

Catwoman: Now that they’re all taken care of, it’s time to get what I came for out of that safe.

[She cracks the safe.]

Catwoman: Try and get one over on me, will you, Harv? I don’t think so.

[Someone’s putting a gun to her head.]

Two-Face: Get your filthy paws off that, now.

[Screen going white. We hear the sound of a discharge of electricity and the cry of pain.]

Hugo Strange: Wake up, Mr. Wayne. We have much to discuss.

Bruce Wayne: Strange? You won’t get away with this...

Hugo Strange: I already have.

[We’re going back in time, to the streets where a reporter, Vicki Vale, covers an important event for the city.]

Vicki Vale: This is Vicki Vale reporting live from Arkham City: the controversial super-prison built right here in the heart of Gotham. In a few moments, Bruce Wayne will be live on stage to explain his sudden interest in Gotham politics. The infamous playboy millionaire has never been one to…

Bruce Wayne: It’s billionaire, Vicki. Millionaires are so last year.

[Screen going white again. We hear a scream of pain.]

Hugo Strange: I assume that you thought yourself untouchable. Well, as you can see, no one is untouchable.

[Bruce takes the stand. He’s surrounded by reporters and photographers.]

Bruce Wayne: Thank you! Thank you, everyone. Imprisoned behind these walls, gang leaders are fighting a bloody war in the middle of our once great city. Every inmate from Arkham Asylum and Blackgate Prison has been relocated to this facility. How can this be safe for the people of Gotham?

[Screen going white once more. Bruce is in pain again.]

Bruce Wayne: You have to shut Arkham City down. It’s out of control.

Hugo Strange: Shut it down? By the end of tonight, I will be a hero, just like you... BATMAN.

[[File:batman-arkham-city-logo.png|thumb|center|400px]]

Bruce Wayne: Today, I’m starting the campaign to close Arkham City and make Gotham safe again.

[Several soldiers run up to him.]

TYGER Officer: (via radio) Remember, Wayne is the priority target.

TYGER Soldier: Surround him! Hands in the air, Wayne!

TYGER Officer: (via radio) Target secured.

[One of the soldiers knocks Bruce out with a buttstock to the head. He wakes up in a small room. Hugo Strange has already turned off the lamp that shines into Bruce’s eyes.]

Hugo Strange: I feel I should thank you. Capturing Bruce Wayne is so much easier than Batman. And now that we have you, Protocol Ten is ready to begin. It will be my legacy, a monument to your failure and if you try to stop me, I guarantee everyone will know your secret.

[He comes out of the room. Ominously, normal light comes on and we see Bruce sitting in a barracks chained to a chair. Hugo Strange’s voice is coming from a speaker nearby.]

Hugo Strange: (via speaker) You are mine, new inmates. Let me introduce myself. I am Professor Hugo Strange and I am in charge of the Arkham City Facility. Up until this point you have shown a total disregard for the law for society and yourself. From this moment on, you are no longer part of the society that you have shown no respect for.

[Bruce swings on the chair and frees himself. A guard enters the room.]

TYGER Guard: What the hell are you doing? Did you think we wouldn’t hear you?

[Bruce intercepts his blow and throws him to the floor.]

TYGER Guard: Help me! Escape in progress!

[Another guard comes in, bumps Bruce’s head against the monitor and throws him out of the barracks into town.]

TYGER Guard: Welcome to Arkham City, Wayne!

[The street ends up clogged with prisoners. TYGER soldiers strictly watch their behavior. There’s a checkpoint nearby.]

Inmate: What are you doing here, Wayne?

Inmate: Did you kill your butler?

Inmate: You’re going to die in here, rich boy!

Inmate: You’re mine!

TYGER Guard: On the ground. Now! (shoots) What are you waiting for, Wayne? Line A. Move!

Black Mask: No one arrests Black Mask. No one!

TYGER Guard: Give up, Sionis!

Black Mask: Get me Strange!

TYGER Guard: Line A! Now! Don’t fight it!

Black Mask: Stop it!

Inmate: Please! Help me!

TYGER Guard: You’re nothing in here! Line A, prisoner!

TYGER Guard: Wayne! You’re in Line A. Move it, rich boy!

[Bruce is lining up for the entrance.]

TYGER Guard: You two get out the way! Wayne! Get your ass up here!

Inmate: I did. What’s it to you?

Inmate: I hate the Penguin.

Inmate: Bruce Wayne? You’re on my list. Bang.

Inmate: Break his face! C’mon! Smash him in the face!

TYGER Guard: Move up, prisoner! I said, break it up! NOW!

[Bruce is getting a buttstock in the face again.]

Hugo Strange: Lower your weapons. Mr. Wayne will not be any trouble. Will you, Mr. Wayne? The cuffs can stay on. We don’t want to make things too easy, do we?

TYGER Guard: Close the doors. Prepare for insertion!

[Bruce is being led to the door to Arkham City.]

Political Prisoner: I can’t believe I’m going to die here.

Jack Ryder: Bruce Wayne? Great. There I was reporting on your crummy press conference and now here we both are. I guess that’ll teach you to get involved in politics, won’t it?

Bruce Wayne: Listen to me carefully. When they open the door, do not panic. Stay close to me.

Jack Ryder: Do you think I’m taking advice from some guy who’s never even been in a fight?

Bruce Wayne: Stay calm. They’re trying to scare us.

Jack Ryder: Sorry, man. It’s every man for himself.

[They hit a long hallway with a lot of prisoners on both sides. Some of them jump the fence and try to attack Bruce, but he dodges and then helps Ryder.]

Inmate: Hey! Over here! Look at me, Wayne!

Inmate: You’re gonna die in here!

Jack Ryder: Wayne! Help me!

Political Prisoner: Help me!

Inmate: When I’m done, you’ll only have a face for radio!

Inmate: Hey! Where’s your freakin’ butler!?

Inmate: Wayne! You ain’t gonna last five minutes in here!

Jack Ryder: Please, Wayne!

Inmate: Wayne! Can you spare me a dime?!

Bruce Wayne: On your feet, Ryder. I said, get up!

[While Bruce helps Ryder get up, one of the inmates hits him in the legs with a bat.]

Penguin: Welcome to hell, Brucey-boy. Lights out, rich boy!

[The inmate hits Bruce in the head with a bat. He wakes up in some alley.]

Penguin: Wakey-wakey, Wayne! Oh, what’s up? Do you need me to call your butler?

Bruce Wayne: Cobblepot!

Penguin: Aw, you remember me. I’m touched. Your family destroyed mine, Wayne. This… well, let’s just call this good, old-fashioned revenge.

[He puts on knuckles and tries to hit Bruce, but he dodges and breaks the Penguin’s arm.]

Penguin: GET HIM!

[A few prisoners are coming in.]

Penguin: Hurt him! I think he’s broken my bloody hand! Get this gate open! Now!

[After a few quick dodges, Bruce breaks the cuffs.]

Inmate: He broke free! How’d he do that?

Penguin: You’re gonna pay for this, Wayne!

[Bruce beats all the inmates and knocks the Penguin out with one powerful blow.]

Bruce Wayne: I can’t contact Alfred from down here. I’ll need to get higher. Alfred, have you got my location?

Alfred: (via radio) Only just, sir. There’s more interference than usual.

Bruce Wayne: I need an immediate drop on the roof of the Ace Chemicals building. I’m on my way there now.

Alfred: (via radio) Of course. I watched your incarceration on the evening news. Was getting yourself arrested a part of your plan all along?

Bruce Wayne: Not exactly, although I did get some one-on-one time with Hugo Strange.

Alfred: (via radio) And how was that?

Bruce Wayne: Not good. He knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman. He also told me that something called Protocol Ten will make him famous. I can’t leave Arkham City until I find out what it is.

[Bat Wing flies through the night sky and drops a metal capsule.]

Alfred: (via radio) Did it arrive, sir?

Bruce Wayne: Right on time.

[He opens the capsule with his palm print and suits up.]

SOLOMON WAYNE COURTHOUSE
Batman: Alfred, I took an encryption key from a TYGER guard. I’m going to hack into their communications.

[He hacks the net with his descriptor and a previously obtained SIM card.]

TYGER Helicopter: (via radio) All units, this is AIR TYGER 4. We have confirmation that Prisoner 4011 is in the courthouse. I repeat, Catwoman is in the Courthouse.

Hugo Strange: (via radio) Is she in danger?

TYGER Helicopter: (via radio) Affirmative. Target is being held by Dent. We believe he intends to kill her. How should we proceed?

Hugo Strange: (via radio) (laughs) Stand down. Let Two-Face have his fun.

TYGER Helicopter: (via radio) Understood.

Batman: That doesn’t sound good.

Alfred: (via radio) No it does not. Mister Dent’s predilection for all things binary may not bode well for Miss Kyle.

Batman: If there is one person in Arkham City who knows what’s really going on, it’s her. I need to find Catwoman now.

[Batman spreads his wings and goes to the courthouse. A gang of thugs meets him at the doorsteps.]

Inmate: Over in the courthouse, Two-Face is getting ready to skin the Catwoman!

[Batman easily beats them up and walks into the building. He goes up to the second floor and sees a hearing happening downstairs in the courtroom. A bunch of thugs are standing there with banners. Two-Face philosophizing with his best half.]

Two-Face: (undamaged side) The only way to get by in this place is to get ourselves some respect.

Two-Face: (skinned side) Fear. That’s how we get respect. Show them all how we do things.

Two-Face: (undamaged side) We should be fair, though. This is a place of justice, after all.

Two-Face: (skinned side) Screw justice. Kill her and they’ll all fear us. Bring out the defendant!

[He rips the blankets off the convict. It turns out to be the Catwoman. She hangs on a rope above a vat of acid.]

Catwoman: You certainly know how to keep a girl hanging, Harv. Hey, have you had some work done?

[Two-Face slapping her.]

Two-Face: That’s for stealing from us. No one steals from us!

Catwoman: I’m sorry. I’ve been a bad kitty. Untie me and I’ll make it up to you.

Two-Face: Let’s see if the coin thinks you’re telling the truth.

[He flips his coin. The undamaged side falls out.]

Two-Face: This court is now in session. Order in the court! Order! Order!

Inmate: (shots at the others) Be quiet!

Batman: Taking out the thug with the gun is the key. Without him, the rest of the room won’t be a problem.

Two-Face: Fresh faces for the gang. Today we present each of you with an exciting new opportunity. Two opportunities. To join with us. To create a new force in Arkham... And take this place for ourselves! When the clown dies, we will own this town! We will RULE this town! Or you can just leave now. And we will hunt you down and kill you all! But let’s not dwell on the negative. Let’s have some fun! Fate delivered a gift to us tonight. A gift that will show everybody that we mean business. And you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, will be part of it. Help us decide if we should kill the bitch who tried to steal from us. Or let her go to do it again! Like hell we will. There are two sides to every story. Let’s hear hers before passing judgment. Nah! Let’s just kill her and be done with it. So what will it be, distinguished members of the jury? Is the bitch guilty? Or should we let her go steal from someone else?

Catwoman: Objection! Isn’t that a leading question, Harvey?

Two-Face: Silence in my court!

Catwoman: Let me go, boys I’ve got places to go, people to see.

Two-Face: More like things to steal. Maybe I should just cut both your hands off... Or maybe we should wait for the verdict? Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say. I’m hoping for a hung jury anyway.

[Batman knocks out an inmate with an automatic rifle and watches the whole time, standing on a rope under the ceiling.]

Inmate: It’s the Bat! Run!

Inmate: What’s he doing here?

Two-Face: Our friend Batman has arrived. Grab him and cut him in two! Hold still while I pass judgment! Damnit!

Catwoman: Are you just playing with these guys?

[The Knight of the Night takes out all the inmates in the courtroom.]

Two-Face: Your sentence is death, Batman! Objection!

[He shoots Batman in the chest.]

Two-Face: Overruled!

[After killing the Dark Knight, Two-Face approaches the Catwoman.]

Two-Face: Heads or tails, kitty cat?

Catwoman: Which one lets me out of here alive?

Two-Face: (flips his coin) Not this one. Time to die!

Catwoman: I vote for a stay of execution.

[She scratches it with her claws, untie her legs and bounces off a dangerous vat of acid.]

Catwoman: No gun, Harv? Shame. This is gonna hurt.

Two-Face: Two guns, bitch!

[He doesn’t have the time to shoot - Batman hangs him on the rope.]

Catwoman: And I thought it was cats who have nine lives. How’s it hangin’, Harv?

[She smacks his stomach with her foot.]

Catwoman: (grabbing what she’s stolen) Come to kitty. Anyone ever tell you that you’re full of surprises?

Batman: I figured you could use my help, Selina.

Catwoman: You’re right. I think I chipped a nail back there.

Batman: Funny.

Catwoman: So what do you need, Mr. Detective?

Batman: Protocol 10. What do you know, Selina?

Catwoman: Never heard of it.

Batman: That’s not what I wanted to hear. What about Strange?

Catwoman: I don’t trust him. He’s been missing for years and then is suddenly put in charge of running Arkham City. Rumor has it he’s been working with Joker, planning something very special just for you. Maybe that’s “Protocol 10?”

[Meanwhile, someone with the Joker’s voice is watching the courthouse at the sight of a sniper rifle.]

Voice: Twinkle, twinkle, little bat, watch me kill your favorite cat! (laugh and cough)

Catwoman: The ex-District Attorney here said something about... What the hell?

[Someone tried to shoot her, but Batman spotted the green laser beam in time.]

Voice: See you soon, Bats. (laugh and cough)

Catwoman: This place is dangerous. I like it. You expecting a kiss?

Batman: It was Joker. You’re not safe here. No one is.

Catwoman: Nine lives, remember?

[She uses her whip and leaves the building.]

Batman: I need to locate where the bullet entered the court and where it impacted.

[Batman is starting an investigation.]

Batman: The bullet hit the floor here. Now, where did it enter the room? The trajectory the bullet traveled will lead me to the shooter.

[He goes to the nearby chapel. It was from her roof that the shot was fired.]

Hugo Strange: Protocol Ten will commence in 10 hours.

Inmate: Is he still in there?

Inmate: I think so. I can hear someone in there.

Inmate: Keep that door shut, man. I don’t wanna go head to head with Batman.

Inmate: You didn’t say it was Batman. Why the hell are we still here? We should run, or something.

Inmate: You think?

Inmate: Don’t be stupid. If you keep that door closed, he can’t get out and we’re safe.

Inmate: Really? What’s stopping him going out the back?

Inmate: There’s a back?

Inmate: Yeah. Two-Face showed me. There’s a basement. It’s full of cells. There’s some guy down there.

Inmate: And you didn’t think to mention it till now?

Inmate: What’s he doing here? He’s not one of us, is he?

Inmate: I saw him. He appeared out of nowhere. Took out everyone in the court.

Inmate: At least the kitty cat got offed.

Inmate: He saved her too. And took out the boss.

Inmate: You cold?

Inmate: Course I’m cold. It’s like 10 below out here and Harley left us outside to freeze to death. Crazy bitch. Bet she’s nice and warm in there.

[Batman’s dealing with them.]

Batman: I’m at the church. It looks like Harley Quinn is inside.

Alfred: (via radio) That dreadful woman is no doubt setting a trap for you.

Batman: Don’t worry, Alfred. Quinn never was too smart. I’ll be OK.

[He enters the church. Harley’s throwing herself on him right away.]

Harley Quinn: Comin’ through, B-man!

[But her attempt fails - Batman easily blocks the attack.]

Inmate: Let the lady go, bat freak! Or these people all get a bullet in their heads!

Harley Quinn: I think you should do what he says. It would be a’shame to get blood all over my nice new outfit. What do you think, Bat-Brain? Like it? What am I saying, ’course you do. Who wouldn’t? So, anyway, here’s the deal. Mister J is really not up to a visit right now. He’s not feeling himself... Well, actually, he was earlier, but that’s not what I meant. He’s not doing so good and that idiot doctor sent from here didn’t help. I’ve seen more smarts from these bozos. I’ve got to run, boys. If he tries anything funny: KILL HIM!

[She leaves.]

Batman: Attacking armed thugs head on is suicide. I need to disappear, pick them off silently, one by one.

Inmate: Don’t you move, Batman. Just stay there and this will all end OK.

[He drops a smoke pellet and jumps on one of the gargoyles near the ceiling.]

Inmate: Where’s he gone?

Inmate: He’s vanished! He disappeared!

Batman: They don’t know where I am. Good, let’s keep it that way. Time to survey the room. Plan out my tactics. Four thugs, all armed, two hostages. This is gonna be easy.

Inmate: We need to get out of here!

Inmate: He’s gonna get us!

Inmate: Batman! Can you hear me?! Try and get us and these people die!

Batman: That idiot thinks he’s safe in the confessional. He’s just made it easier for me to get in behind him.

[He silently knocks the inmate out and rescues the hostage.]

Batman: You’ll be OK. Wait here and don’t make a noise.

Inmate: Can you see him? Where is he?

Inmate: I don’t know where he is. I can’t see him! He could come from anywhere!

Inmate: Keep it together! Hello? What’s happening? Answer me, man! What’s going on?

Batman: He’s got a hostage. I can glide to the scaffolding above him without being seen and take him down from there.

M.P.T. Aaron Cash: (to inmates) When this is over, I’m going to make you regret this.

Inmate: Shut up! Shut up!

[Batman is rescuing the second hostage.]

Batman: You’re safe. Stay quiet.

Inmate: Can you see him? Where is he?

Batman: If I get behind those two without being seen, I can take them both in one move.

[He descends quietly from the gargoyle, comes to the inmates from behind and bumps their heads against each other.]

Batman: The room is secure, you’re safe now!

M.P.T. Aaron Cash: Thank God. Yo, Batman, thanks for the help!

M.P.T. William North: I’ll get you free, Doc.

Doctor: Thank you.

M.P.T. Aaron Cash: OK, people, listen up. We’re in control here. Not these animals. I want this place locked down tight. All medical staff, check supplies. Find out if anything was taken.

Doctor: What about Stacy? Isn’t anyone going after her?

M.P.T. Aaron Cash: I don’t know if any of you just noticed, but Batman just saved our asses. If anyone can find her, he’ll do it. OK, does everyone understand? Look after the wounded, keep the bad guys out. We’re a team! Let’s keep it that way! Thank God you got here, Batman.

Batman: After what happened at the asylum, I thought you’d settle for a quiet desk job.

M.P.T. Aaron Cash: Yeah, right. When Sharp closed down the asylum. It turned out that there wasn’t much work for an ex-security guard who failed to stop a mass breakout. This is the only work I can get.

Batman: What happened back there wasn’t your fault, Cash. What was Harley Quinn doing here?

M.P.T. Aaron Cash: That crazy bitch busted in a couple of hours ago with the rest of these idiots. Took something up the tower and then blew up the staircase.

Batman: Thanks. I’ll check it out.

M.P.T. Aaron Cash: Wait! I mean, sorry, Batman, forgot: Couple of them grabbed one of the docs. Quinn said something about needing her to fix up the Joker.

Batman: If she’s alive, I’ll find her. You concentrate on securing this church. It should keep you all safe.

M.P.T. Aaron Cash: Will do. Hope you find the doc. Her name’s Stacy Baker. She’s one of the good ones.

Batman: (to himself) The gunshot came from the bell tower. I need to find a way up there.

[Batman finds his first Riddler’s Trophy.]

The Riddler: Hello, Dark Knight. Did you find that easy? You were supposed to. That was merely a taste of what is to come. You will regret trying to outsmart me. You will solve my riddles and you will collect my trophies. You may not want to, but you must. It’s a matter of life and death.

[He climbs to the top of the bell tower, using his hook to move along the broken stairs.]

Batman: There’s the gun. It looks like it’s being controlled remotely by Joker.

[The room is filled with hand-made bombs from flammable barrels. Next to the rifle are two full-length Joker figures with TVs on their heads. The TVs are on and we see the scariest clown in Gotham.]

Joker: Well, look who it is. I haven’t seen you for, how long has it been? Let’s see, there was an asylum, some monsters, and oh, that’s right, you left me to die. Now you probably don’t remember it that way, but who cares? You just need to worry about the bombs. Hurry up now. Clock’s ticking.

[Without losing a second, Batman runs to the window and jumps out of it, smashing stained glass. He spreads his wings and flies towards the near future. The bell tower explodes.]

Batman: Alfred, I’ve got a lock on the signal used to remotely control the sniper rifle. Joker’s behind this.

Alfred: (via radio) Was there ever any doubt?

Batman: The radio signal should lead me right to him.

Alfred: (via radio) Good luck, sir.

SIONIS STEEL MILL
[Batman starts exploring the city for a signal source. The search leads him to the Sionis Steel Mill. Batman hears Harley’s voice coming from speakers all over the factory. Judging by the look of it, the Steel Mill was captured by the Joker gang long ago.]

Harley Quinn: Listen up, dumb-asses and listen carefully. As you know, Mister J... he’s... he’s not himself, and the last thing he needs is any so-called superhero coming in here and stopping his recuperation. That’s where you come in, morons. You need to protect the Steel Mill, protect it with your life, because if you fall, I’ll make sure your miserable lives don’t mean zip. You get it? Good!

Batman: Alfred. I need to find a route into the Sionis Steel Mill.

Alfred: (via radio) Have you tried the front door, sir?

Batman: Why didn’t I think of that?

Alfred: (via radio) It was obviously too easy. Let’s see... If all other access routes are locked down, the only way in would be no... it’s suicide.

Batman: The main chimney? OK then.

[Batman spreads his wings and flies straight into the factory’s smokescreen. He lands on a thin steel wire over boiling steel.]

Batman: The steam from the furnace will boil me alive. I need to cool down the coals somehow.

[He’s using his hook to open the flap. Part of the piano floods with a powerful stream of water and Batman moves on. He breaks through the floor with a special gel and walks under the floor of the loading bay. He hears the inmates’ voices coming from above.]

Inmate: Yeah, Joker wants you to think he’s sick. Then, wham! Gotcha!

Inmate: I don’t know, man. He looks pretty sick.

Harley Quinn: I promised you some entertainment, right, boys?

Dr. Stacy Baker: Please. I did my best.

Harley Quinn: Well, you should have tried harder.

Dr. Stacy Baker: (scream)

Harley Quinn: That useless quack has failed Mister J. And you know what that means.

[The inmates chant "Kill!"]

Dr. Stacy Baker: Help me!

Harley Quinn: Stop! Change of plan, take her to the smelting chamber. Mister J wants this one to suffer a little longer!

Inmate: You’re coming with us, Doc!

Harley Quinn: Right then, the rest of you idiots get out of here. You know what you have got to do! Go get the snowman and bring him back here right NOW! He’s going to pay for screwing over Mr J. I need him back here like yesterday!

Inmate: Who was Harley talkin’ about?

Inmate: Sounds like she’s declared war on Freeze.

Inmate: Yeah. She sounded pissed. How’s he connected to Joker and all this mess?

Inmate: How should I know? She’s always freaking out these days. Joker really must be sick after all.

Inmate: I guess. I always figured he’d last forever. Know what I mean?

Inmate: Maybe it’s got something to do with all that crap back at Arkham Island. You saw what happened, right?

Inmate: Only what was on the TV. He was like some kind of freakin’ monster. He was, he was huge. I thought he was going to start ripping choppers out of the air.

Inmate: And then, next time we see him, he’s all normal lookin’.

Inmate: Yeah, normal. Like he ever looks normal.

Inmate: OK, whatever. He looked like the Joker.

Inmate: Yeah. It was weird I don’t buy it. This is all part of Joker’s plan. It must be. He’s gonna be fine. He’s just screwin’ with the Bat.

[Batman jumps out from under the floor, surprising the inmates.]

Inmate: Look out! It’s Batman!

Harley Quinn: Well look who didn’t get blown to pieces in Mister J’s lovely trap! Don’t let him get away again, boys. Hey, Bat-Brain! Don’t ya have somewhere better to be?

[Batman kicks a whole gang of inmates’ asses.]

Harley Quinn: What the hell are you doing here? You’re supposed to be dead! Well there’s no way you’re getting to Mister J. We’re safe and sound up here. You can just stay down there and burn!

[She leaves for the main office upstairs. Batman stays downstairs.]

Batman: Alfred, Joker’s holed up in the manager’s office in the Steel Mill.

Alfred: (via radio) I’m sure you’ll find a way, sir.

Batman: Of course I will. Some of his goons dragged a doctor away. I’m going to find her first, then deal with Joker.

[There are muffled voices coming from the top floor.]

Harley Quinn: Oh, Mister J, it’s a miracle. You look perfect... oh... no, it’s not you is it?

Joker: Be quiet, Harley. (coughs)

[Batman goes to the assembly line.]

Inmate: No one said anything about the Bat coming here.

Inmate: So?

Inmate: I’m just saying. I thought the whole point of being locked up in here was that Batman was out there. You know, in Gotham.

Inmate: You scared of the Big Bad Bat?

Inmate: No! Not scared exactly, but... Well, he broke three of my ribs back at the asylum and my arm six months ago.

Inmate: Better make sure he don’t come too close then.

Inmate: Easier said than done, man. You’ve never seen him in action.

Inmate: And when I do, I’m gonna teach him not to mess with me. Harley wants him dead, and I want a piece of Harley.

Inmate: Are you insane? Harley? Have you forgotten about her boyfriend?

Inmate: Way I hear it, the whole world will have forgotten about her boyfriend soon enough. Then I get a ride on the Harley.

Inmate: Or a bullet in the face. Seriously. Don’t get too cocky. Batman’s dangerous. Hell, Harley’s dangerous.

[Batman pushes a button on a full-length Harley cartoon figure, with a heart in her hand.]

Harley Quinn: (recorded) Hello? Is this thing on? If you don’t stop pressing that button, I’m… tell my Joker and he will be sooooo angry. Keep this to yourself, but I think Batman may be here. If you see him, kill him! Listen, If anyone asks about Mister J, tell them he’s fine. No, don’t tell them anything. Well, tell them that you’re not going to talk about it, and then shoot them in the face. OK?

[Batman is trying to move on...]

Batman: They’ve got that doorway covered. I need to find a different way to get past Joker’s men.

[Batman quietly removes security and walks into the Smelting Chamber.]

Inmate: It’s gotten quiet out there.

Inmate: Stay here, I’ll go check it out.

[But Batman’s already knocked out most of the inmates!]

Harley Quinn: He’s making you look stoooopid! I should be the one making you stupid. Hmmm? How about I make you all wear nice little dresses?

Inmate: Can I get you something, doc? How about a painkiller? Just tell us how to fix the Joker and you can crawl outta here.

Harley Quinn: How do you think poor Mister J is going to get better if you idiots fail to stop the rodent?

[Batman eliminates the remaining prisoners and knocks out an assault rifle-armed thug guarding the doctor.]

Batman: Can you stand?

Dr. Stacy Baker: Give me a second. What’s wrong with these people? That crazy woman thinks I can fix the Joker.

Batman: What’s wrong with him?

Dr. Stacy Baker: There’s something in his blood, some kind of toxin. It’s killing him. He blames something called Titan.

Batman: TITAN?

Dr. Stacy Baker: Yeah, do you know what he’s talking about? He kept going on about his last laugh.

Harley Quinn: (via her statue) Uh, uh, Doc! Isn’t that information supposed to be confidential?

Dr. Stacy Baker: What’s happening? How does she know what we’re saying?

Harley Quinn: Get that door sealed up nice-n tight, boys. We don’t want the vermin escaping, do we?

[The mercenaries weld the front door from the other side.]

Dr. Stacy Baker: At least they won’t be getting in. We’re safe, right?

Batman: Wait here, doctor.

[He walks up to the power transformer and opens the lid.]

Dr. Stacy Baker: What the hell are you doing?

[Batman removes an element from the transformer and plugs it into one of his gadgets.]

Batman: I need to get out of here. Someone needs to stop Joker. Stay here. You’ll be safe.

Dr. Stacy Baker: You sure?

Batman: If you hear anyone coming, hide. I’ll be back.

[Batman’s arsenal has now been expanded with Remote Electrical Charge, a special device that allows you to send electrical discharges at a distance. Batman quietly walks through the ventilation and comes out to the henchmen welding the door.]

Hugo Strange: Protocol Ten will commence in 9 hours.

Inmate: And what? We just wait for the Bat to try and break through the door, and then we jump him?

Inmate: That’s the plan.

Inmate: It’s not a plan. It’s a suicide note.

Inmate: I’m not scared of him. The door’s welded shut and he’s just some freak in a costume.

Inmate: OK, then you stand in front.

Inmate: Why? You chicken?

Inmate: Will you two just shut the hell up and get ready? I don’t like this anymore than you do. But if we’ve got one chance, It’s that we all jump him. Together.

Inmate: It’s the Bat!

[Batman deals with them quickly and goes out to the loading bay, where Harley and the Joker are hiding. He’s taking out his new device. It gives Batman the means to control the chain hook and break the door to the Joker’s office.]

Harley Quinn: How did you get out of the smelting chamber, B-man? What did you build? Tell me, tell me!

Joker: Harley! Get back in here! I think I’m dying!

Harley Quinn: Now see what you’ve done! Scram B-man! Coming, Mister J! What’s wrong with you, B-man?! You come into Mister J’s home and start smashing it to pieces? Don’t you know he’s sick!?

[Batman tries to climb into the office, but he gets hit in the face by a one-armed clown with a hammer named Abramovici.]

Harley Quinn: Surprise, B-man! Meet Mister Hammer! He’s gonna teach you some manners!

Abramovici: You will die here, little bat! I will crush every bone in your body! I will leave you smeared across this room! You are not going to reach the Joker. I will stop you!

[Batman scatters a crowd of henchmen and throws a heavy clown to the floor with half a dozen powerful blows to the stomach.]

Harley Quinn: No! Why, why, why, why, why??!!

[Batman enters the office. Harley is crying over Joker’s body.]

Harley Quinn: You!

Batman: Get out of my way, Quinn.

Harley Quinn: Leave us alone, B-man... just leave me with him.

Batman: I said move!

[He pushes her away and she falls to the floor.]

Harley Quinn: This is all your fault! You’ve hounded him for years, beat him to a pulp, and for what? Why are you so mean???!!

[Suddenly, a real Joker is pouncing on Batman from behind. He uses his gas to take the dark knight’s will to resist.]

Joker: Surprise! You fell for the ol’ fake Joker gag, Batman.

[Harley hits Batman in the face with a bat.]

Harley Quinn: Batter up!

[She hits him in the face with a baseball bat and Batman passes out. Meanwhile the Catwoman sits on the roof of the next building...]


Baudelaire
Catwoman: Sounds like the detective will be busy with the Joker for a while. Good. Gives this kitten some time to play. So, what next? Help tall, brooding, and handsome, or help myself to all the loot Professor Strange has locked up in that vault of his? I know, difficult choice, right? Hmmm, what will it be? Find Croc and have him rip a hole into the vault? Ask Penguin for some explosives? Not my style. I always prefer a woman’s touch in these situations. Stay where you are, Ivy. I’m coming to get you.

Catwoman: I need to get my kit from my apartment. No way I can face ivy without my things. I’d be naked without them.

[Catwoman runs on the roofs of Arkham City and then graciously climbs into one of the buildings.]

Inmate: Can’t kill people on an empty stomach! How are we supposed to find out where she lives anyway?

Inmate: Two-Face said she lives somewhere near here.

Inmate: So what? How does he know?

Inmate: How am I supposed to know. I don’t question the boss. You shouldn’t either.

Inmate: I know, I know. How come he’s so pissed all of a sudden anyway?

Inmate: Oh, I dunno. Maybe it’s because Catwoman left him hanging over that acid tank?

Inmate: Really?

Inmate: Yeah. He had her just where he wanted her and the bitch broke free.

Inmate: Seriously? How come I miss all this stuff?

Inmate: Maybe it’s because you spend half your life eating that crap in those tins, and the other half on the crapper.

Inmate: Yeah, there’s something wrong with it.

Inmate: Then here’s an idea. Stop eating it and find out where Catwoman’s been hiding.

Inmate: Lookout! It’s the Cat!

[Woman cat cleverly defeats the inmates, climbs into her nest and grabs her equipment]

Catwoman: It’s good to be home. OK, Selina, time to find Ivy. Let’s hope she’s forgiven me. Of course she has. She wouldn’t hold a grudge. Well what do we have here? Weird, out of place plants, check. Mindless, hypnotized henchmen... check. The oh so subtle odor of rotting pumpkins... check. Looks like I found the entrance to Ivy’s lair.

[She walks into the building.]

Catwoman: Hello? Ivy? You here?

Poison Ivy: You shouldn’t have come here!

Catwoman: Oh, c’mon. You’re not seriously going to hold that against me forever, are you?

Poison Ivy: You killed them all.

Catwoman: They were just flowers, Ivy. I’ll buy you some new ones. I know a place that…

[Ivy knocks the Catwoman off her feet with a liana.]

Catwoman: C’mon, Red. Can’t we just... Oh, for the love of...

[Ivy grows a few pods pn the floor from which drugged inmates come out.]

Catwoman: Hey, Pammy, here’s an idea! If you want a boyfriend, how about trying the dating route? Beats this voodoo crap.

Poison Ivy: Don’t let her hurt me. You can’t outrun nature, Selena. My spores will fill your lungs and kill you from within.

Catwoman: You done, Red?

Poison Ivy: Do you really think you can beat mother nature? A billion micro-organisms will enter your bloodstream. Spores will grow, replacing the blood in your veins, and when I’m done, your flesh will be replaced with bark.

Catwoman: Are we done yet, Ivy? I just want to talk. That’s all.

Poison Ivy: If you’re still breathing, it’s not over.

Catwoman: She’s consistent. I’ll give her that.

Poison Ivy: I’ve spent weeks perfecting the toxins that will destroy your pathetic meat sack of a body.

Catwoman: Look, Red, I just need your help.

Poison Ivy: Never!

[When Catwoman conquers all enemies, Ivy grabs her with her vines hanging her head down.]

Catwoman: Not again.

Poison Ivy: You’ve got some nerve, Selina.

[She touches Catwoman’s face with her poisoned tentacle. We move back to Batman, who’s in a difficult situation. Harley Quinn is getting ready to take his mask off!]

Joker: Get back here, Harley! (coughs)

Harley Quinn: But I want to know who he is, sweetie.

Joker: No one’s who you think they are, my dear. Why spoil the fun?

Batman: It was all a lie. There’s nothing wrong with you.

Joker: Nice of you to say, but you of all people should know... There’s plenty wrong with me.

[He comes out of the shadows with a big smile. His face is covered with boils and his right eye is filled with blood.]

Joker: Take my blood for example. I wish somebody would... This stuff is killing me!

Batman: Why should I care?

Joker: Because now there’s a teeny little bit of me in you too, Bats.

[Batman dramatically looks to his left and sees he’s hooked up to a machine that injects the Joker’s blood into him.]

Joker: Oh, c’mon. Don’t tell me it’s not what you always wanted. Look, we’re running out of time, I need your help. I nearly had a cure; it was so close and then it was taken from me.

Batman: So we both die. I’m fine with that.

Joker: Are you? Imagine, sucking down that last breath, knowing that Gotham is doing the same.

Batman: What are you talking about?

Joker: Oh, didn’t I say? I’ve spent weeks shipping samples of my blood to emergency rooms all over the city.

Batman: So, that’s Protocol Ten. Poison Gotham. I expected more.

Joker: Protocol Ten? (dramatic grasp) Never heard of it. Hold tight!

[He pushes Batman, tied to a chair, out the window.]

Joker: I’ll be in touch!

[Batman wakes up with a phone attached to his chest with scotch tape. The phone’s ringing.]

Batman: I’m listening.

Joker: Is someone feeling a little down?

Batman: What do you want?

Joker: Oh, Bats, cheer up. It won’t kill you. Oops.

Batman: Where is the cure? Who has it?

Joker: I had our cold-hearted friend Mister Freeze making it. But he’s gone dark on me.

Batman: I’ll find him.

Joker: I bet you--

[Batman crushes the phone, takes the SIM card out of it and puts it in his suit’s computer.]

Batman: Alfred, Joker’s poisoned me. He may have poisoned Gotham too. Mister Freeze has the only cure.

Alfred: (via radio) What are you waiting for then? He’s in Arkham City. Find him!

Batman: If only it was that simple. He’ll be somewhere cold. He needs to be kept at sub-zero temperatures to survive.

Alfred: I don’t wish to worry you, but it is the middle of winter out there.

Batman: I noticed. I’ve calibrated the cowl to track heat signatures. I’ll find the coldest point in Arkham City.

[He starts flying around town looking for the coldest point. Along the way, he hears the conversations of different gangs of inmates sometimes kicking their asses.]

Batman: Freeze’s lab must be this way. I’m definitely heading towards the coldest point.

Joker: I can’t believe I didn’t think of this earlier. A hotline straight to my bestest friend in all the world. Just think, I can call you up whenever I get bored. I think our relationship is really maturing here. The next thing you know is we’ll be exchanging emails or meeting up for romantic dinners.

Inmate: Who do you think will be next?

Inmate: Quin Ds sending people out looking for Freeze. If he double crossed Joker, I’m figuring we’ll be sticking him in sooner or later.

Inmate: I think we’re going to need a bigger car.

Inmate: I’m telling you. It’s all true. The Joker’s dying in there, This is our last chance to show all the other freaks in this place who’s the real boss of Arkham City.

Inmate: Yeah! I’m ready to go out there and kick some Penguin ass.

Inmate: Me too!

Inmate: We do this for the Joker! When we roll outta here, we find anyone who may know where Freeze is, and beat the information out of them!

Inmate: It’s Batman!

Political Prisoner: If anyone can hear this, I’m on the root of the old Gotham FM building. I think it’s on the North bank of the Gotham River. Someone’s hunting me. I need help!

Inmate: Nah. Getting caught is their problem.

Inmate: True.

Inmate: Anyway, from up here we can see what the clown’s planning.

Inmate: Who cares what he’s planning. Everyone’s saying he’ll be dead soon.

Inmate: What the hell happened?

Inmate: Don’t know. Gas leak?

Inmate: I saw him. He appeared out of nowhere. Took out everyone in the court.

Inmate: At least the kitty cat got offed.

Inmate: He saved her too. And took out the boss.

Inmate: So what now? Batman and Catwoman are free, Two Face is strung up and we’re stuck out here in the cold.

Inmate: It’s the freakin’ Bat!

Inmate: Why’d he save Catwoman. She’s a thief like us, right?

Inmate: She’s better looking than you. And who say she’s one of us? I hear she plays both sides.

Inmate: So what are we going to do now?

Inmate: I’m off to find Black Mask.

Inmate: Why?

Inmate: I used to roll with him. He’ll remember me for sure. I can put in a good word if you like.

Inmate: Yeah that would be cool.

Inmate: Screw Black Mask. The real power in this place is Joker.

Inmate: You think? I heard he was sick.

Inmate: Of course he’s sick. It’s the Joker.

Inmate: How did he know?

Inmate: He’s got some kind of deal going with Strange. That’s why he’s got Freeze down there.

Inmate: Batman! It’s Batman!

Inmate: Batman! He’s here!

Inmate: I don’t know. Maybe I was taking a leak?

Inmate: Look out! It’s Batman!

Hugo Strange: (via radio) The perimeter wall is out of bounds to all residents of Arkham City.

Inmate: There you are, Bat. Get over here! I’ve found Batman!

Inmate: What?

Inmate: You’re not getting past me again!

Inmate: What’s the Bat doing here!?

Inmate: Lookout! Batman’s here!

Inmate: Sharp must have paid off big time to pull this off.

Inmate: What the hell kind of plants are those?.

Inmate: They look kind of familiar.

Inmate: Since when have you been into flowers?

Inmate: I’m not!

Inmate: Sounds like you are.

Inmate: I’m just saying I’m sure I’ve seen them somewhere. Where was it?

Inmate: Back in your bedroom? Next to the pink satin sheets?

Inmate: Are you looking to get your head put through that window?

TYGER Helicopter: We’ve lost sight of Batman. I repeat, target is missing.

Inmate: Where is it?

Inmate: I don’t know. I’m sure this is the place.

Inmate: So do we just wait?

Inmate: We have to. I’m hungry, man. I want to be first in line when the food comes.

Inmate: And you’re sure it gets dropped off round here? How do you know?

Inmate: I heard one of Joker’s guys talkin’ bout it back there.

[Batman finally finds the coldest spot in town.]

Batman: The old GCPD building Freeze must be using one of the old forensic labs give got to get in there.

Inmate: What’s stopping it?

Inmate: The door, it’s shut tight!

Inmate: So what now?

Inmate: You two keep trying to get in. I’ll blow their faces off If they try to get out.

Inmate: And then what? We just grab Freeze and take him back to the Joker?

Inmate: Sounds like a plan. Anyone got anything to smoke?

Inmate: Nah, I’m out. Since Joker and Penguin went to war, It’s getting harder and harder to get what you need in here.

Inmate: I know what you mean. Maybe Penguin’s crew has got some. Guess we can find out after we kill ’em all.

[Batman quietly knocks them out the fully armed inmates.]

TYGER Helicopter: Target in sight.

[On one of the inmates, Batman finds a radio with the Penguin’s voice coming from it.]

Penguin: Can you hear me? What’s going on? On, for the love of...

Penguin: If any of you idiots at the GCPD are still capable of breathing, switch to channel Puffin-Zero. Do you understand? Puffin-Zero. Now!

Batman: If I hack the radio, I’ll be able to listen in to all of Penguin’s communications.

[He hacks the radio and enters the GCPD building.]

OLD GCPD BUILDING
Inmate: The Joker’s crew are still outside, Mr. Cobblepot.

Penguin: (via radio) Good. Make sure it stays that way.

Inmate: No problem. Listen up. The boss wants this place held tight. No one in or out. You see one of Joker’s crew, waste ’em.

Inmate: What about Batman?

Inmate: Kill him too.

Inmate: Just like that?

Inmate: Just like that!

Inmate: What does it look like?

Inmate: How do I know?

Inmate: So how will we know when we find it?

Batman: Penguin’s thugs have got this room locked down tight. I need to find different way in.

Inmate: What does Freeze do here, anyway?

Inmate: No idea. All I know is Penguin wants it. It’s good enough for me.

Inmate: We can’t find it. It’s not here!

Penguin: (via radio) Let’s get this straight. Are you telling me that you are all so incompetent that you need me to come down there and help you search a room?

Inmate: Err, no. I mean...

Penguin: (via radio) Well, it sounds like that’s what you’re saying.

Inmate: Please, Mr. Cobblepot. I didn’t mean it. We’ll find it.

Penguin: (via radio) Good. Oh yeah, one last thing. I hear Batman’s coming your way. Good luck.

Batman: Penguin’s keeping track of his crew using heartbeat monitors. He’ll know each time take someone out. I need to move quickly.

Penguin: (via radio) Are you mocking me about? Find him!

Inmate: Penguin gave an order, so MOVE!

Inmate: I’ve got someone here!

Inmate: This is no good. He won’t wake up!

Inmate: How’s he keep doing this? What’s going on?

Inmate: Shut the hell up. We need to keep looking or we’re all dead!

Inmate: What’s wrong?! Too scared to show yourself?

Penguin: (via radio) I’m running out of patience. You’re running out of people. Let’s see what runs out first!

Inmate: You heard what the Penguin said, right?

Inmate: It came from over here! I’m sure of it!

Inmate: There’s someone here!

Inmate: There you are, Bat. Get over here! I’ve found Batman!

Inmate: He’s gone! I lost him.

Penguin: (via radio) Two down.

Inmate: We’ve got to find him. NOW!

Inmate: I know what you’re doing and it ain’t gonna work! Or now?

Inmate: Jeez! It’s you. I could have killed you!

Inmate: Stop pointing that thing at me!

Inmate: He’s here, Mr. Cobblepot. Batman’s here!

Penguin: All alone, son. You’d better not piss me off by dying. I’d hate to have to wake you up to kill you again.

[Eventually, there’s only one inmate left in the lab.]

Inmate: Please! I give up. Look at me! I’m dropping my weapon. You don’t need to hurt me!

Batman: Where’s Freeze?

Inmate: He’s in the museum! Penguin’s got him!

Penguin: (via radio) I’ll have to cut that tongue out of your head, boy. I don’t like people tellin’ tales on me.

Inmate: No! I’m sorry, Mr. Cobblepot. He made me tell him.

Penguin: You can leave him, Batman. I’m safe and sound here in my Museum. Try and get me if you like. I’ve got plenty of surprises ready for you if you do, starting right now.

[A mild earthquake happens.]

Batman: That doesn’t sound good. Alfred.

Alfred: (via radio) Hello, sir. Have you retrieved the cure from Mister Freeze?

Batman: There were complications. Penguin has got his hands on Freeze and trapped me in the GCPD building.

Alfred: (via radio) You do realize that you will actually die if you don’t get this cure soon.

Batman: Thanks for reminding me, Alfred. I’m in a police building. Cobblepot’s obviously bribed some official into giving him the lock codes for the municipal structures. I’m downloading the unlock codes right now.

[Once out on the street, Batman is in for a little surprise… The bridge to the police station explodes.]

Penguin: (via radio) See. I told you it would work. Blow the bridges and cut off the clown’s forces. Easy.

Penguin Thug: (via radio) But Mr. Cobblepot, we’re stuck too.

Penguin: (via radio) So?

Penguin Thug: (via radio) We can’t get back.

Penguin: (via radio) And your point is?

Penguin Thug: (via radio) Well, it’s just... You’ve left us over here with the Joker’s crew.

Penguin: (via radio) Try to take some of them down before you die, son. (laughs)

Penguin Thug: (via radio) You bastard....

TYGER Helicopter: We have visual on the explosion. Thermal scans show multiple detonation points. Over.

Command Center: (via radio) Roger that AT3.

Hugo Strange: (via radio) It appears that Mr. Cobblepot has made his move. Leave them to it. It will be interesting to witness how things progress as we approach Protocol Ten.

Command Center: (via radio) Affirmative. AT3, continue your patrol. Out.

NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM
[When Batman enters the museum, he is met by several inmates armed with knives. The passage to the museum itself is closed with a lattice gate. This is a trap - it is impossible to go into the building without activating it and not closing the lattice gate.]

Inmate: This is Penguin’s turf you freak. I’m going to cut you up into tiny pieces for breaking into here.

Announcer: All visitors should be sure to check out our latest attraction, "Dangers from the Deep," in the Aquatic Observation Chamber. All visitors with a valid ticket or concession card can enjoy a discount at the nearby, world-famous Iceberg Lounge. Welcome to the cyrus Pinkney Natural History Institute.

[After defeating the scumbags with knives, Batman jumps into the next room, breaking the window. It is in this room that the panel is responsible for managing the door trap. He is trying to hack the panel with his decoder.]

Penguin: I don’t think I want you breaking into my little home, Batman.

Batman: Something’s blocking communication back to the Batcave. Penguin must be using military grade communication disruptors. The only way to crack this security is to destroy them.

[He scans the city to the jammers of the signal, then leaves the museum.]

Inmate: How does this thing work, anyway?

Inmate: All you need to know is Penguin wants this thing powered up. While it’s working, no one in this hell-hole can use anything that broadcasts out into Gotham.

Inmate: So that’s why my cell phone stopped working.

Inmate: Yes, dumb-ass, that’s why your cell stopped working. Did you even listen at the briefing?

Inmate: Nah.

Inmate: Figures. Listen, this is the deal. If anyone interferes with this tower, it will be our fault. Mr. Cobblepot doesn’t like it when his people fail him.

Inmate: The Bat’s here!

[Batman beats scumbags and destroys the first jammer.]

Inmate: Just got to remember. You see weird ass plants round here and you know you’ve found Poison Ivy, which is a bad thing.

Batman: The jamming tower has 3 terminals attached. I’ll need to destroy all three to shut it down.

Batman: One jammer down. I should look for more.

Penguin: What’s going on out there? One of the jammers’ signal’s disappeared!

Penguin Thug: Sorry, Mr. Cobblepot. I don’t know.

Penguin: Well find out! And while you’re doin’ it, make sure the other jammer’s safe or I’ll find you and I’ll stick what’s left of it up your…

Inmate: Is it working?

Inmate: According to the log, all wave frequencies are being suppressed. The entire site is radio secure.

Inmate: Nice. Where does Cobblepot get military-grade kit like this from?

Inmate: He’s a collector. He’s got things you’ve never heard of in that museum. Crazy stuff.

Inmate: Like what?

Inmate: No way, man. First thing you learn about Cobblepot. Keep your mouth shut.

Inmate: We’re in control here.

Inmate: No muscle, no protection, yeah, Wayne’s a dead man for sure.

Inmate: We own Arkham City. Screw anyone else who thinks they do.

Penguin: I’ve lost one of you idiots. Let’s end it there.

Inmate: Keep it up! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

Penguin: Batman’s done something to the jammers up top! Where are the rest of you idiots?

Penguin Thug: We’ve only just managed to get below ground. We’re at the…

Penguin: Just set it up wherever you are. Do it now! Batman’s probably on his way down there! Understand?

Penguin Thug: Yes, sir, Mister Cobblepot.

Batman: The signal’s blocked again. Sounds like Penguin’s final jammer was activated somewhere underneath Arkham City.

Inmate: Must be going crazy. Could have sworn I saw some kind of Ninja over there.

Inmate: What the hell were they carrying?

Inmate: Penguin sent ’em down under ground to set up another comms disruptor. I guess he’s still trying to screw with Batman.

Inmate: Lookout! It’s the Bat!

[Soaring to the entrance to the subway Batman has to enter into a fight with two armed thugs. Disarming them with the help of a hook, he knocks them off and enters the subway.]

Inmate: Penguin sounded pissed.

Inmate: Batman’s been screwin’ with his plans.

Inmate: Do those things even work underground? I read the manual, it never said anything about working underground.

Inmate: Yeah, they work.

Inmate. If you say so.

Inmate. Since when have you been all about reading, anyway?

Inmate: I read.

Inmate: Porn don’t count.

Inmate. Screw you.

[Batman silently knocks them both out.]

Inmate: I’m telling you, it’s him.

Inmate: It can’t be.

Inmate: It is. Look again. He looks big, right? He’s gray?

Inmate: This poster’s got to be over a hundred years old. How can it be the same guy? And even if it was, how did Penguin get him?

Inmate: I don’t know, but I’m sure it is. It’s even got a name.

Inmate: Sol-o-mon… Grundy? Stupidest name I ever heard.

Inmate: That’s the thing you can hear in the museum. You know, "Solomon Grundy. Born on a Monday."

Inmate: You may be right.

Inmate: The Bat’s here!

Batman: That was one of the TITAN Containers Joker had back at Arkham Asylum. What is it doing here?

Inmate: You heard the Penguin. Batman’s on the way.

Inmate: Good. I always wanted a chance to go up against that freak.

Inmate: But I thought he wanted us to drag this thing over to the Joker?

Inmate: He did. I guess Batman’s made him change his plans.

Inmate: Who cares? We kill Batman, then we drag this thing to Joker turn it on, and go back to Cobblepot as heroes.

Inmate: What? Just like that? Kill Batman?

Inmate: Yeah. I’m not scared. He’s nothing. Just some idiot in a costume. He’s nothing.

[Sneaking through the ventilation shafts, Batman goes out to the station, guarded by a lot of armed thugs. He has to act quietly and eliminate them one by one.]

Penguin: Don’t you dare let ’im get to my disruptor!

Inmate: Penguin’s losing it. We’ve got to get to Batman ASAP.

Inmate: We own Arkham City. Screw anyone else who thinks they do.

Penguin: I’ve lost one of you idiots. Let’s end it there.

Inmate: They were right. I’ve found someone! C’mon, wake up. Dammit, he’s out cold!

Inmate: Huh? I’m sure it came from over there!

Inmate: What’s wrong?! Too scared to show yourself?!

Inmate: Is… Is that supposed to scare me?

Inmate: Where the hell are you?

Penguin: I’m running out of patience. You’re running out of people. Let’s see what runs out first!

Inmate: You heard what the Penguin said, right? There’s someone here!

Inmate: Wake up. Do ya hear me? Wake up!

Penguin: This is all wrong. Pull it together or I’ll get someone to pull you apart.

Inmate: What the hell is going on?

Penguin: I’m one man down. That’s not good Is it? Still, I’m sure the rest of you will do your best not to disappoint me.

[Knocked off all the thugs, Batman destroys the jammer.]

Batman: That was the last jammer. I should be able to get into the museum now.

Penguin: What the hell is happening down there? Hello? Is someone going to answer me? I give you one simple task: stick up a couple of freaking machines. And what? You couldn’t even get that right? I hope Batman broke every bone in your stupid bodies. I hope you are lying there, desperately trying to breathe through fractured ribs and punctured lungs. If you’re not, you’d better summon up whatever strength you’ve got left and run, ’cause after I’m done with the Bat, you’re all next!

[Batman goes back to the museum and hacks the trap and sees a new type of enemies. Armored prisoner beats a policeman with a baton.]

Batman: He’s wearing body armor. I’ll need to unleash a series of quick, focused attacks to penetrate his defenses.

At this time, the information record of the museum is coming from the speakers.]

Announcer: The Tyrannosaurus Rex was a bipedal carnivore that roamed the land that eventually became Gotham City over 65 million years ago.

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: Go to hell I said… I’m not tellin’ you nothing.

Inmate: What’s the Bat doing here!?

[He strikes an armored enemy with a lot of quick blows. Batman manages to save a policeman who was beaten up by a prisoner.]

Batman: You’re safe… for now.

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: Thank God!

Batman: You may want to hold off on thanking Him until after you’ve answered my question. Who are you?

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: Sorry, man. I’m a cop. Gordon sent us in here.

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: I’m from the 13th Precinct, part of the strike team. Been in here since the beginning.

Batman: If Gordon sent you, you’ll know the code?

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: Yeah, yeah! He said… Oh man, what was it?

Batman: The code! Now!

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: It’s "Sarah" He said to tell you the code is "Sarah".

Batman: You’re safe, officer!

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: It’s Jones, Batman. Elvis Jones.

Batman: Gordon always said he planned on sending your team in.

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: He wanted to know what was going on in here. I guess we found out. There were ten of us. Hopefully, there still are.

Batman: I told Gordon It was too dangerous to send you in. Stay here. If the rest of your team is alive, I’ll find them.

[Batman walks up to a stand behind the glass of which sits a girl in a ninja costume. He pushes a button and hears the Penguin’s explanation.]

Penguin: Now this little minx is a real puzzle. Where did she come from? How did she kill 8 of my men before we managed to hold her down and beat her into unconsciousness? All I know, is… I like her pajamas. (laughs)

[Batman adds all police officers on the museum grounds to his computer. He then stumbles into the aisle with the lattice gate closed and the button behind it.]

Batman: A Remote Controlled Batarang can hit switches that are out of reach.

[The roar of the crowd can be heard from deep in the corridor. There’s a wounded policeman walking towards Batman.]

Injured Policeman: Help… me!

[Someone’s killing him with a gunshot to the back. Batman’s getting ready for the fight. The killer is the Penguin.]

Penguin: I wouldn’t do that if I was you. Show ’im what we’ve got.

[A one-armed thug comes out of the corridor and carries a policeman.]

Penguin: So, Batman, you ’ere for the cops? The Ice-man? Or me?

Batman: I was only here for Fries and the hostages. But now, I’m taking you down too.

Penguin: Aren’t you scary?

Batman: You’re about to find out.

Penguin: Am I really? Listen, I’m what you might call, a collector. If someone wants it, I like to think… I’ve got it. And, if I don’t have it, I’ll get it. So here’s the thing. Back there, I’ve got a cabinet with your name on it, just waiting to be filled. And, as luck would have it, here you are, standing just where I want you. So, what do you think? Are you going to be a good boy and give up nicely?

Batman: You’re not giving orders here anymore, Cobblepot.

Pinguin: I was hoping you’d say that. Look around you. This horrible bunch of psychopaths are all begging to join up with me, but unfortunately for them, I only take the best. And today, best means whoever can kill you. Come on out, lads. It’s initiation time!

[Batman has to fight a lot of prisoners in a closed arena.]

Penguin: Stick a knife in him! Do you lot want to join with me or what? You weren’t supposed to do that, Batman. You’re forcing me to bring out the big guns.

[He shoots his umbrella at a cage attached to the roof and the cage falls to the ground. A TITAN poisoned freak rips out of the cage.]

He doesn’t look happy to see you, Batman. Good luck!

[Batman defeats the freak.]

Batman: (via radio) I found Penguin.

Alfred: And Mister Freeze? Have you located the cure yet?

Batman: Not yet. The situation is worse than I thought. Penguin has a supply of the TITAN formula.

Oracle: He’s got what? How’d he get TITAN off Arkham Island? What’s going on here? Your suit’s bio readings are spiking.

Batman: Nice of you to join us, Oracle. Alfred, bring Barbara up to speed.

Alfred: Of course.

Oracle: But…

Batman: I’ll be in touch.

[He finds a way out of the arena and goes to the center of the museum which is flooded and frozen. As soon as Batman enters the room, Penguin shoots him with Mr. Freeze’s gun and freezes his hand to the wall.]

Penguin: Stay where I can see you, Batman. You wouldn’t believe the fight the old snow man put up. Still, I got what I wanted. That’s all that matters. Hold still, boy!

[He’s freezing an escaping policeman.]

G.C.P.D. Officer Forrester: No…No…No..

Penguin: When you’re done in here, feel free to join me in the Iceberg Lounge so I can kick your arse again. Enjoy the copsicle!

G.C.P.D. Officer Forrester: Over… here… please!

Batman: The ice looks unstable. I need to move slowly, take my time.

G.C.P.D. Officer Forrester: Please… help… me!

Batman: Hold on! You should be safe here.

G.C.P.D. Officer Forrester: Th-thank… you.

Batman: Are you from the 13th Precinct? Where’s the rest of your team?

G.C.P.D. Officer Forrester: There… two more guys in this room. Penguin froze ’em up, then went after me. I ran and… Well I guess you saw what happened.

Batman: I’ll get them. You wait here and try to warm up.

[Batman jumps on thin ice and starts walking on it slowly and carefully.]

Penguin: Sorry, Batman. Did I forget to mention my little friend down there? Meet Tiny. Who’da thought a big fish could be so useful? Not me, that’s for sure. He’s like a mobile garbage truck. Whatever I drop in that tank, just… vanishes. Poof. Problem gone.

[A giant shark jumps right out of the icy water on Batman. It chews off a piece of ice and plunges underwater.]

Batman: The undercover cops need my help. If I leave them in the ice they’ll freeze to death.

[Batman finds a way to get to a frozen policeman.]

G.C.P.D. Officer Whitman: So…cold, Where did P…penguin get that gun?

Batman: He stole it from Mister Freeze. I’m getting it back.

G.C.P.D. Officer Strickland: Please… someone… Help me!

Batman: Stay here for now.

G.C.P.D. Officer Strickland: No… pr… problem, sir. There are… more of us.

Batman: If they’re still alive, I’ll find them.

[He’s sailing up one of the corridors available to him. Going a little ahead, Batman discovers a vast area well guarded by the Penguin’s men.]

Batman: They’re using thermal imaging headsets. Anyone wearing them will be able to spot me hiding up in the darkness.

Inmate: No worries, Mr. Cobblepot. We’ve got it covered. Freeze’s suit is In the case. I’m looking at it now.

Penguin: You better, son. Batman’s on the way and the last time I saw him, he didn’t look very happy.

Inmate: He’s not getting past me and the boys, sir. The suit is safe.

Penguin: Tell the boys there’s an extra hundred grand in it for whoever brings him in alive.

Inmate: Very generous, sir. Consider it done.

Penguin: I’m one man down. That’s not good is it? Still, I’m sure the rest of you will do your best not to disappoint me.

Inmate: There’s someone here!

Inmate: Hey! Wake up man! C’mon, wake up!

Inmate: How’s he keep doing this? What’s going on?

Inmate: Shut the hell up. We need to keep looking or we’re all dead!

Inmate: What’s wrong?! Too scared to show yourself?

Penguin: I’ve lost one of you idiots. Let’s end it there.

Inmate: You heard the Penguin. Move it!

Inmate: Well look who it is? This’ll teach you for trying to steal from me. You guys go. I’ll be along soon.

Inmate: You’re not getting away from me.

Penguin: Are you mucking me about? Find him!

Batman: One of Penguin’s crew has taken that cop hostage. The only way to save him is to make sure his captor doesn’t see me.

[He silently sore from one of the gargoyles and knocks the prisoner out with a kick.]

Penguin: What’s happening in there? Have you lot stopped Batman yet? What about Freeze’s suit? Answer me!

G.C.P.D. Officer Miller: I saw you clear the room. Awesome work, man! The name’s Tom. Tom Miller.

Batman: You’re part of Gordon’s strike team. I’ve seen your file.

G.C.P.D. Officer Miller: You have? I mean, yes, sir, Cobblepot’s turned this place into a fortress, Someone ratted us out. Me and the boys got grabbed, brought here, and beaten the crap out of.

Batman: You’re safe now. There are just 2 more or you unaccounted for.

G.C.P.D. Officer Miller: Have you tried the Iceberg Lounge? Cobblepot liked to take us in there to beat us up some more. If we’re lucky, that’s where they are. OK, listen up. In case you didn’t notice, Batman just saved our asses. From this point on, we own this room. No one in or out.

G.C.P.D. Officer Sanchez: What about the little bastard that did this to us? I want payback.

G.C.P.D. Officer Miller: You’ll get it. We grab guns, hole up here till Batman finds the rest of the squad and then we’ll get our payback on Mr. Cobblepot. Michaels! Grab a firearm and start a patrol.

G.C.P.D. Officer Michaels: No problem.

G.C.P.D. Officer Miller: Sanchez, cover the main entrance. Let’s make it out of here in one piece, OK?

G.C.P.D. Officer Sanchez: see one of those sons of bitches and they are dead.

G.C.P.D. Officer Miller: We do this by the book, guys. It’s what Gordon would want. We’re better than these people.

Batman: No sign of Fries, just his suit. He can’t survive without it. I need to find him before it’s too late.

G.C.P.D. Officer Whitman: I saw you over there, Batman. I take it anyone working for Cobblepot is unconscious now.

[Back in the icy central hall, Batman hears the Penguin’s voice through the loudspeakers.]

Penguin: Hello, Batman. Can you hear me? Course you can. Thought you’d like a little entertainment to go along with the ice skating. Tell him your name, son.

G.C.P.D. Officer Denning: Yeah? Screw you!

Penguin: This piggy’s still got some life in him. Good. Let’s hear him squeal. What you’re hearing is the sound of an undercover cop having his fingers frozen to sub-zero temperatures. Now, I wonder what would happen if I take this hammer and… Well, what do you know? His whole bloody hand explodes.

[Batman enters the opposite corridor by crossing the icy lake. That’s where he sees three scumbags clearly setting a trap for him.]

Inmate: You scared, little bat?

Inmate: Hey, what’s he doing? He’s got some kind of computer thing.

[Batman hacks the panel and turns off the trap.]

Inmate: How’d he do that? You said he couldn’t get through!

Inmate: Shut up and hit him!

[Batman walks up to a showcase with two hyenas and presses a button.]

Penguin: Recognize Joker’s pets? Me too. That’s why I had them shot and stuffed!

[Then he presses the button of the window in which Mr. Freeze himself sits.]

Penguin: Surely no introduction is necessary. A prize-winning cryogenic scientist pushed to the edge of sanity by a desire to help his poor, dying wife… Or an old man, captured by me and stuck on the grill?

[Trying to get to Victor, Batman breaks through the wall with his exploding gel, but a one-armed freak immediately pounces on him.]

Abramovici: I shall slice you into pieces, American. I hear you defeated my brother. He was always weaker than me! I shall kill you!

[Batman beats him and comes up to Victor. He grabs his head.]

Batman: Joker’s cure. Where is it?

Victor: Forget the clown, I want Cobblepot. He has my suit. My weapons. I end him for what he’s done to me.

Batman: Penguin’s mine. You need to stay focused on that cure or innocent people will die.

Victor: You don’t understand. I cannot complete my work without it. I must have it. Everything depends on it. Everything.

Batman: Penguin is protecting himself with your ice gun. How do I get past it?

Victor: Do I look like a fool? Why would I tell you that?

Batman: Because if I can’t get past it, I won’t help you get your suit. Think about it, Victor. You don’t look well. If you’re gone, what will happen to Nora?

Victor: (shocked) Leave my wife out of this Batman. Don’t let this situation fool you. We are not friends.

[Batman pulls out Victor’s cooling battery.]

Victor: No! No!

Batman: Today is not a good day to push me, Victor.

[He’s pouring some liquid from the battery onto the floor.]

Victor: Stop! There’s a security override chip I built into the suit to stop anyone using my weapons against me.

Batman: How did that work out for you?

Victor: Why don’t you go get the security override and figure out a way to stop him yourself.

Batman: It’s been a pleasure, Victor. Keep thinking about that cure, ll get you your suit back.

[He throws the battery under Victor’s feet.]

[Batman returns to the flooded and frozen main hall.]

Batman: It looks like the ice is beginning to thaw.

[Having crossed the lake with the help of a raft and a bathook, Batman returns to the freed policemen. In the very place where they were held is a stand with the suit of Mr. Freeze.]

G.C.P.D. Officer Miller: So that’s the famous Freeze suit.

Batman: Unfortunately.

[Batman breaks the glass and pulls the cooling battery out of the suit.]

G.C.P.D. Officer Miller: What are you doing?

Batman: When I leave here, wait 10 minutes, then get this over to Freeze. He won’t be dangerous.

G.C.P.D. Officer Miller: No problem, Batman.

[After examining Mr. Freeze’s costume, Batman manages to create a device that blocks the freezing gun.]

G.C.P.D. Officer Michaels: Who are these people? That looks like military grade thermal imaging kit.

[Batman goes to the Penguin’s place - Iceberg Lounge.]

Penguin: Hello, Batman! I know it’s you! What is it? Finally grown a pair and come to find me? This place is mine, Batman. Piss off outta here! You’re mine, Batman!

[Batman walks up to Penguin with a gun blocker behind his back.]

Penguin: Tell you what, Batman. I’ll give you this one for free.

[Batman presses the button and the gun stops working.]

Penguin: What? C’mon, fire, damn you!

G.C.P.D. Officer Denning: Please! Help us!

Penguin: What the hell is wrong with this thing?

[Batman’s powerful uppercut knocks the Penguin off his pedestal.]

Batman: You’re finished, Cobblepot.

Penguin: No! I’m sorry! Please don’t hurt me.

Batman: I can’t guarantee that.

Penguin: Me neither.

[He presses the remote and the iceberg on which Batman was standing is blown to pieces. Batman lands in a vast arena. The pieces of ice flying down almost smash his head into it.]

Penguin: I tried to help you Batman. I gave you the opportunity to end this and walk away, but oh no. You had to be the big man. Well, guess what? From up here, you look pretty small. Don’t look so sad, I’ve got a little surprise for you down there.

[He presses a button and a huge monster at the far end of the arena gets a discharge of current. This repeats several times.]

Monster: Solomon Grundy. Born on a Monday. Christened on Tuesday. Married on Wednesday.

Penguin: I found him down there when I bought this place. Comes in handy!

[Solomon Grandy rips the chains that were attached to the wall. At their ends, we see huge metal balls. Batman has to go into battle with an unbeatable monster. He has to do a trick - he’s not fighting Grandy himself, but with a device that feeds him with energy.]

Penguin: Stop that! No! What the hell are you doing? Oh, you’re asking for it now! Let’s see how much that ugly son of a bitch can take!

[He hits Grandy with so much current, his body fires up.]

Penguin: Oh, that looked like it hurt, didn’t it? Good job that bugger’s immortal! Enough with the bloody explosives!  I mean it. No! What have you done? You little. You can’t kill him! You can’t!

[Batman walks up to defeated Grandy to strike him one last blow, but he wakes up and grabs Batman.]

Penguin: Well what do you know? You really can’t kill that bastard!

[The fight continues.]

Penguin: Those things are antiques! Leave ’em alone!

[Batman defeats Solomon Grundy.]

Penguin: Oi! Just you and me left! The Bat vs. the Bird!

[He tries to use his infamous umbrella and shoots several rockets at Batman, but he easily doges and hits the loser in the face. Like fifty times. Mr. Freeze enters.]

Victor: Where is Cobblepot?

Penguin: Well, look who it is. Mister Fr…

[He stepped on his palm with his armored shoe. The penguin screams in pain.]

Batman: Enough! Freeze! Enough.

Victor: Of course. You will regret what you did, Mr. Cobblepot.

[He puts him in a glass stand just like the Penguin held him.]

Batman: The cure, Freeze.

Victor: There isn’t one.

Batman: What?

Victor: Perhaps I should elaborate. Creating an antidote to the disease that afflicts the clown was easy. Unfortunately the cure degrades too quickly. It needs a restorative element, some kind of reforming enzyme, without it it breaks down before it can help the host.

Batman: I’ve seen this before.

Victor: Finding a suitable enzyme is not the only problem. It needs to be adapted, bonded to human DNA. That will take decades: time it appears you do not have.

Batman: What if I told you l know a man who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries?

Victor: What man?

Batman: His name is Rā’s al Ghūl.

[A ninja girl in the next stand unexpectedly comes out of meditation.]

Victor: Bring him to me. All I need is a sample of his blood. It is your only hope.

Batman: Rā’s al Ghūl is dead.

Victor: Then you and the clown are doomed.

Batman: Not exactly. I need someone to tell me where the body is… Then I can go wake him up.

Ninja: Blasphemer. You are not worthy to speak of the great Rā’s al Ghūl.

[She runs away.]

Victor: You are a fool, Batman. You have let your only hope escape.

Batman: No, Victor. If Rā’s al Ghūl is in Arkham City, I now have a trail right to him.

Batman: (via radio) Oracle, change of plan. I’m going after the League of Assassins.

Oracle: Why? What have they got to do with all this? Oh, wait a minute. Is this about Rā’s or his daughter?

Batman: Penguin had one of the League’s assassins imprisoned in the museum. I recognized the insignia. She’s a member of Talia’s elite guard.

Oracle: I knew it. What is it about that woman that makes her instantly the most important person in your world?

Batman: Talia is not the goal, Barbara. I’ve uploaded Freeze’s unfinished cure. It looks to me like the answer is --

Oracle: Found in Rā’s al Ghūl’s blood. OK, Bruce, I guess you need to go after him, but please, stay focused. Don’t let her get in the way again.

Mister Freeze: Are you sure this man can provide the missing ingredient?

Batman: I’ve met Rā’s al Ghūl many times. He claims to be over 600 years old and I believe him. Which means something is keeping him alive.

Mister Freeze: Let us hope you are correct, Batman. After all, your life depends on it.

Penguin: This isn’t over.

Batman: It is from where I’m standing.

Penguin: I’m a patient man. I can wait. I’ll take all this back. Just wait and see. My family used to own Gotham. It will again. You’re going in my collection, Batman. I always get what I want.

Mister Freeze: The structure of the disease that affects you is complicated. The missing element you suggest is interesting from a purely scientific perspective.

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: That’s it, man. This night can’t get any worse. First I got beaten to a pulp by a midget’s goons and now this. My man Denning here gets taken down by a freakin’ ninja.

[Batman leaves the museum.]

Alfred: (via radio) I see you have sent a data request on the League of Assassins to the Batcomputer… on, and another equipment request. Did you ever consider a bigger belt?

Batman: I did. Too heavy. Slowed me down. Let me know when it’s here.

[Batman follows the blood stains left by the ninja girl.]

Penguin Thug: Can anyone hear me? Over.

Penguin Thug: I hear you. It’s chaos here. The boss has vanished.

Penguin Thug: What? Where’d Penguin go?

Penguin Thug: No idea. One minute he was all "Batman’s going in my trophy case", the next, nothing. Zip. I don’t like it.

Penguin Thug: Do you think he’s dead? Did Batman kill him? Have you been back to the museum?

Penguin Thug: The museum’s locked down. Those undercover bitches have taken over. I knew we should’ve killed ’em.

Penguin Thug: So what’s the plan?

Penguin Thug: Lay low. See any of Joker’s crew. Kill ’em.

Inmate: Lookout! Batman’s here!

Batman: The blood trail has run out. The only way I’m going to find that assassin is to locate more evidence.

Hugo Strange: (via loudspeakers) Prisoners of Arkham City: You have given up your basic human rights because of your crimes against society. Gotham is a safer place without you.

Batman: The only way to find Rā’s, is to get a tracker on that ninja. I’ll need to get in close.

[He’s going after a ninja girl. She agily jumps from roof to roof, but the Dark Knight’s vast experience and good knowledge of the city quickly allows him to catch up with her. He secretly plants a tracking device on her.]

Assassin: You only continue to live because the great Rā’s al Ghūl allows it.

[Robin shows up behind her back. He whistles to attract her attention and makes a warning swing with his stick.]

Assassin: Call him off.

Robin: I can take her.

Batman: Stand down.

Assassin: Do not follow us.

[She jumps off the roof and disappears.]

Batman: I didn’t need your help.

Robin: Really? That’s not what it looked like from where I was standing.

Batman: I had it under control. Why did Alfred send you?

Robin: He was worried about you.

Batman: Take this, get it analyzed and start searching the hospitals and emergency rooms. Anyone with this blood in them will be dead within 24 hours.

Robin: Whose blood is it? Oh… It’s yours, isn’t it? I’ll get it to the hospitals and come back. You need my help here.

Batman: I can handle it. You’re needed in Gotham. Things could get worse. Much worse.

Robin: You think? If Strange really knows who you are, what happens If he tells everyone? How will you…

Batman: Trust me. I’ll find a way.

Robin: If you need me, you know where I am.

Batman: I know. Now go!

[Batman takes the new device Alfred sent him. Then he goes after the ninja girl.]

Inmate: I don’t like it. They say Batman’s taken down the Penguin.

Inmate: Do you think it’s true?

Inmate: I don’t know, man, but if it is, we need a plan now. With Penguin gone, Two-Face will make a move. He’ll take over. I know it.

Inmate: Didn’t Catwoman take him down?

Inmate: Nah. I heard she just hurt him. He’s coming back. No one knows how, but he will.

Inmate: It’s time you losers did something to prove you wanna to work for Two-Face.

Inmate: What do you mean prove ourselves? We just took out Joker’s crew.

Inmate: Those idiots were easy. Anyway, Joker’s on his way out. Soon he’ll be dead and someone needs to run this place. Two-Face says it’s gonna be him.

Inmate: I don’t plan on disagreeing.

Inmate: I’ll do it! I hate Penguin!

Inmate: Lookout! It’s the Bat!

Inmate: Whoa, this is Gotham, not Tokyo. We don’t have ninjas here -- do we?

Hugo Strange:  (via loudspeakers) Do not attempt to escape from this facility, TYGER operatives will pacify any attempted escape with extreme prejudice.

[Batman enters Gotham’s Courthouse.]

Inmate: I still don’t get it. Why is this guy here?

Inmate: I told you, Two-Face wants us to look after him. Stop Batman from getting him.

Inmate: You spoke to Two-Face? Where is he?

Inmate: That doesn’t matter right now. All you need to know is he wants this chump looked after.

Inmate: What did he do?

Inmate: Who knows?

Inmate: The boss knows. He’d a told you.

Inmate: Well he didn’t. Look. There’s no conspiracy. We’re a team, right? We work together and do what we’re told.

Inmate: I guess.

[Batman beats them up and rescues a policeman.]

M.P.T. Eddie Burlow: I didn’t want to do it, but he made me. He had my friend. He stuck a knife in his leg. It’s all my fault but he was going to kill him.

Batman: Where is he?

M.P.T. Eddie Burlow: He’s insane. He told me to get everyone out of the church. He said they’d all die if I didn’t. I was scared. He kept blaming you.

Batman: You’re safe now.

M.P.T. Eddie Burlow: He told me to tell you something. He was very, very specific. It’s just some numbers: 2-7-5, 3-2-5. I have no idea what they mean.

Batman: They sound like a radio frequency.

[He decides the signal.]

The Riddler: At last. I suppose I should fulfill my side of the agreement. A riddle for a bat. Can you solve it?

M.P.T. Eddie Burlow: Did you figure out what the numbers mean?

Batman: Yes. It’s just one of Riddler’s games. He gave you something, right?

M.P.T. Eddie Burlow: Yeah. It’s just a box. I don’t know what it does.

Batman: l’ figure it out. You should head back to the church, you’ll be safer there.

The Riddler: Riddle me this: If you know me, you’ll want to share me but if you share me, I’ll be gone. What am I?

[Batman answers using the machine.]

The Riddler: Well done, Dark Knight, you did it. Like a child learning to walk for the first time, I feel I should reward this miracle and give you the location of the poor, soon to be dead doctor, who is desperately crying out for help.

Batman: (via radio) Riddler’s loose in Arkham City. He’s taken the guards from the church hostage.

Alfred: As I recall, he’s been incarcerated since you led the police to his location from Arkham Island. What does he want?

Batman: Revenge. He’s leaving me radio frequencies and he gave me a device to decode his riddles. They lead to map references within Arkham City.

Batman: I’ll let you know how I get on.

[Batman finds an old acquaintance in one of the cells at the police station.]

Calendar Man: Thirty days has November. April, June, and September. Of twenty eight is but one.  Of course Leap Year comes and slays. Every four years got it right, and twenty eight is twenty nine. Don’t be scared, Batman, Halloween will be a day to celebrate if you come and see me. Halloween Halloween, All Saints day. Wake up the witches or someone will pay.

[Batman starts searching the city for the location pinpointed by the Riddler.]

Inmate: On, please. If Harley Quinn takes over when Joker croaks, I’ll waste her myself.

[In a small narrow alley, Batman notices something’s wrong. He walks up to the wall and knocks on it a few times. The wall appears to be a fake one. Batman breaks it down with his bare hands and finds a door behind it.]

The Riddler: So you decided to finally show up, did you?

Batman: Let them go, Riddler. They’re innocent.

The Riddler: Don’t be stupid, Dark Knight. They wouldn’t find themselves in the predicament they are currently in if they had tried to think just a few steps ahead now,  would they? Now if you solve the room ahead and four other equally challenging ones, you save them.  If you don’t, then they die, and we’ll see if society crumbles at their passing.

Batman: You’re insane.

The Riddler: No, that would imply either mental illness or derangement. I suffer from neither. Oh, and yes, I can see you, Batman, and I look forward to watching you fail.

[Batman tries to get in, but the door is locked.]

The Riddler: Come now, Dark Knight. How can a mere door thwart your attempts to rescue that pathetic individual. Do I need to provide you with a key? How about a cheat code?

[Batman solves the puzzle and goes inside a large room where the floor is lined with electric panels. At the top of the room is a platform on which a tied medic sits.]

The Riddler: Well done, Dark Knight. You figured out how to open a door.

Medic Adam Hamasaki: Hey! Batman! You’ve got to help me! Get me off of this thing!

The Riddler: Is that really you, Batman? Has someone SWITCHED places with you? I see you have resorted to cheating in order to complete my conundrum. I suppose I shouldn’t be disappointed in you. It was inevitable that you would solve it this way.

Medic Adam Hamasaki: Help me!

Batman: Hold tight.

[He rescues the medic.]

Medic Adam Hamasaki: 6-2-5, 9-2-5! That’s what he told me to tell you. I don’t know what it means, but he said he’d kill the others If I didn’t tell you exactly what he said. Why doesn’t he just tell you what he wants?

Batman: Because he’s insane.

Medic Adam Hamasaki: You don’t say.

[Batman is decoding the new signal.]

The Riddler: Too soon, Dark Knight. The missing ingredient to finding hostages is secrets and you don’t have enough.

[Batman goes into town and keeps looking for a ninja girl.]

Inmate: Even the snot in my nose is frozen.

Inmate: So let’s get this straight. Batman saved Freeze from Penguin. Are they working together?

Inmate: Nah, Batman don’t work with Freeze.

Inmate: But he took down Penguin to get Freeze. Wasn’t Freeze working for the Joker? I’m sure he was. I think the ice box was supposed to be making Joker well.

Inmate: I’m telling you, man. It went down there!

Inmate: You’re just seeing things. No way did something get past us and go down there. No way!

Inmate: Huh? Time to die! I’ve got him! He’s over here!

Inmate: It’s the Bat!

[Don’t pay much attention to them, Batman’s going down through a hole in the ground.]

WONDER CITY
Batman: (via radio) Oracle, I’m heading underground. Below the surface, Gotham’s a maze of old steel and ironwork. My signal may get weak. Try and stay locked on.

Oracle: Re-routing additional satellite coverage now. Good luck, Bruce.

Inmate: Man, I thought it was bad up there. Down here, I’m not just cold, I’m wet and I smell like I’ve been standing in something Croc left behind.

Inmate: Do you ever stop complaining?

Inmate: Shut up! Both of you. We’ve got a job to do. Penguin’s crew are on the run. Joker wants us to off any of them we find.

Inmate: I thought he was offering them jobs?

Inmate: He said it’s up to us. Personally, I don’t like those jerks so I say we put a bullet in their heads.

Inmate: Fine with me.

Inmate: I heard the Riddler was back. Looks like they were right.

Inmate: What’s the Bat doing here?

Batman: Joker’s got his crew moving through the sewers, hunting down what’s left of Penguin’s thugs.

[He finds a secret room that smells like a trap.]

The Riddler: (via loudspeaker) This is not going to be easy, Dark Knight.

Batman decides not to test his fate - he has too much on his shoulders.

Inmate: Listen up! The last of Penguin’s crew are holed up somewhere up ahead. Joker wants ’em found.

Inmate: Do we kill ’em?

Inmate: Up to us.

Inmate: I say we kill them. Half of Penguin’s crew were mercs. Never trust a merc.

Inmate: Look out! It’s Batman!

[Batman beats the inmates and grabs one of them by the neck.]

Batman: Don’t make me hurt you!

Inmate: I’ll tell you what I know!

Batman: Thank you.

[He knocks it out with a powerful blow.]

Hugo Strange: (via loudspeakers) Protocol Ten will commence in 5 hours.

[Suddenly, Batman gets sick. He wobbles and squatters. Apparently the Joker’s poison finally got to him.]

Oracle: Are you alright? Did something happen? All the readings from your suit just went red.

Batman: Just give me a minute. I’ll be alright.

Oracle: No, you won’t. Hurry. You’re running out of time.

Inmate: Man, what’s in these things?

Inmate: Guns, explosives, thermal trackers. Everything an army needs.

Inmate: To kick Penguin’s ass!

Inmate: But how come we’ve got them? Ain’t this place supposed to be a prison?

Inmate: You ask a lot of questions, boy. You sure you’re on the right side?

Inmate: What are you saying? Joker’s my man, you know that. Been in his crew for years.

Inmate: So stop asking questions. You know I don’t like questions.

Inmate: OK, sorry. Just seems weird, that’s all.

Inmate: You guys know what this place is? I never heard of no "Old Gotham" before.

Inmate: I guess you never went to school, did ya?

Inmate: What happened? Too busy wetting your bed to learn something?

Inmate: If you’d bothered learning something, you would know that what we call Gotham is actually built on top of the old city?

Inmate: What old city?

Inmate: Old Gotham. There was some kind of fair, hundred years ago, maybe more. Something happened and bits were demolished. A new city was built on top of it.

Inmate: You learn something everyday, don’t you?

Inmate: It’s the freakin’ Bat!

Batman: (via radio) Oracle, it looks like Joker is sending his crew down to steal weapons off the TYGER guards.

Oracle: That’s not good. Those guys are armed with the latest military weapons. If Joker get his hands on that stuff. Well, you know.

Batman: He won’t. I won’t let him.

[He goes out to a large room with an elevator in the center. Several heavily armed prisoners are holding a doctor hostage.]

Inmate: Well, look what we got here. What’s up, doc?

Fiona Wilson: Please don’t hurt me.

Inmate: Oh, we ain’t gonna hurt you, sweetie. Not a pretty little thing like you.

Fiona Wilson: Please. I’m an intern. I don’t know what’s going on here.

Inmate: Can I have her?

Inmate: No, you got the last one. Get the rest of the guns out and stack ’em up over there. We’re on a schedule here.

Inmate: What are these things?

Inmate: Military grade interference generators. Best money can buy. These babies screw with all electronic equipment in their vicinity. Now, stop yapping and get moving.

Inmate: Man, she looks scared.

Inmate: She’s all alone down here with us. She should be scared. We’re not nice people.

Fiona Wilson: Oh, God. Please. I can’t fix him. Please let me go.

Inmate: Sorry, doc. You’re ours now. Just do me a favor. Don’t try to run. I’d hate to have to punish you. You’ve got such a pretty face.

Inmate: Yeah. You don’t want a bullet going through it.

Inmate: Me, I favor the hammer. More personal, you know. You can feel every blow. Understand the complexity of the human body as it’s deconstructed into a primordial sludge.

Inmate: That’s deep, man. I had you all wrong, I was told you just liked hitting people with hammers.

Batman: Someone in this room is using a signal jammer. I need to neutralize him so that I can scan the room for targets.

Joker: Oooh. I think I just heard someone’s skull cracking against that nice hard floor. Mind the bloody puddle.

Inmate: You heard the boss!

Inmate: I’ve found someone!

Inmate: Hey! Wake up, man! C’mon, wake up!

Inmate: He’s making us look stupid. How’s he doing it?

Inmate: Leave him! We’ve got more important things to be looking out for!

Inmate: Show yourself, chicken!

Joker: Someone’s missing in there. Is it you?

[Batman saves Fiona.]

Batman: Go and hide. Now.

Fiona Wilson: Please help me!

Inmate: Got another one down over here.

Inmate: Not you too. What happened? Just wake up. C’mon!

Joker: Boom! One man down. It’s looking like a re-run of last time.

Inmate: You heard the Joker!

Inmate: They were right. I’ve found someone!

Inmate: Oh, no. You too? Oh, God, wake up!

Inmate: How’s he doing this?

Inmate: What’s wrong?! Too scared to show yourself?

Joker: Is that the sound of one of your faces hitting something hard? I hope so. I can’t believe you let him stop you! What is it? Not enough secret weapons from old Hugo?

Batman: Hang on.

Fiona Wilson: Thank you.

Batman: What are you doing in Arkham City?

Fiona Wilson: I’m In Arkham City? What the hell am I doing here? I was grabbed outside the hospital intern at. They drugged me and I woke up in a building up there.

Batman: The person in charge here has been rounding up doctors to try to fix Joker. Looks like you were unlucky.

Fiona Wilson: He’s dying, right?

Batman: It seems that way.

Fiona Wilson: Is it wrong not to feel bad about that? What now?

Batman: You need to stay here. Keep out of sight and you’ll be fine. I’ll be back.

Batman: (via radio) Oracle, it’s me. Joker’s not stealing the weapons from Strange. Strange is giving Joker the weapons.

Oracle: Are you sure? Of course you’re sure. Why would he do that?

Batman: Maybe he’s trying to control who runs the streets. I’m going to look into it.

Oracle: OK, but… Shouldn’t you find Rā’s first?

Batman: I’m doing that now. Don’t worry, Barbara.

[Batman enters the Wonder City.]

Announcer: This world is doomed. Cities like Gotham will grow to resemble hell breaking through the sidewalk, continuing up into the sky. Structures will grow to blot out the sun, and the people who live in them will be choked by the pollution they create. Eventually, when no space remains, this world will die, struggling for breath as man’s mistakes nail the coffin shut. But this doesn’t have to be your future, Gotham.

[The last few sentences Batman hears are vague. It’s getting darker in his eyes. He starts coughing up blood. But… he manages to get a hold of himself.]

Announcer: There is a better way. Behind this wall is mankind’s chance for survival. A glimpse at a future based on an amazing discovery.

[There’s a prisoner coming to Batman.]

Inmate: They’re… Everywhere.

[He falls to the floor. There’s a knife sticking out of his back.]

Announcer: Are you intrigued? Then step closer. Witness the future of Gotham City.

[Batman is being attacked by some ninja girls. They’re armed with swords and cleverly dodging blows.]

Announcer: The heart of Gotham’s future beats with Lazarus technology. The power of Lazarus is pumped into every street, every home, providing clean, safe energy. Mechanical Guardians will serve you, watch over you and where necessary. protect you from the worst of mankind’s sins. But most importantly, our beautiful world will survive. Ladies and Gentlemen, allow us to present to you the future… Wonder City!

Batman: The tracker’s signal continues beyond this door, but the door looks like it’s been sealed for decades. The assassins must be using another way to get through. These must be the famous Mechanical Guardians of Wonder City. It looks like their inner workings were very advanced; I’m detecting a kind of memory tape they used; almost a primitive video. Perhaps I can scan and analyze it. Damn it! The data is incomplete. This is way ahead of the technology that should have been available back then. It looks like the data is stored in a shared memory pool. Maybe I can retrieve the information from the other guardians down here.

[Batman scans the heads of a dozen robots as he fights with ninja girls. Soon he collects a video that shows the ninja girl opening a secret passage into the city.]

Batman: The assembled surveillance footage shows me where the Assassin went. She must have been using a secret entrance, I need to find it.

[Not far from the main entrance to the city, Batman notices a strange-looking part of the wall.]

Batman: It looks like a sword fits here.

[He takes the sword from one of the ninja girls and inserts it into the socket, then pushes the wall away.]

Hugo Strange: (via loudspeakers) Protocol Ten will commence in 4 hours.

[Next to the entrance to the League of Shadows secret hideout, Batman falls unconscious. He dreams of a giant door opening and his parents coming out of it.]

Martha Wayne: Bruce, you can hear me, can’t you? You need to step into the light. Your father and I are waiting. We’ve missed you so much. You have to do it. We need you to do it, Bruce. Bruce?

[Batman slowly comes to his senses.]

Oracle: (via radio) Bruce! Bruce! Can you hear me? Your vitals… they’re dropping. It’s like they’re in free-fall. You need to find whatever you’re looking for now.

Batman: How long have I got?

Oracle: Oh, thank God. I’m not going to sugar coat it. At this rate, I’d say minutes. Seriously. Bruce, you need to tell me what you want me to do. What do I get Robin to do? You know, if you don’t…

Batman: (weakly) I’ll make it.

[He walks slowly to the hideout entrance, coughing all the time. At the very door he gets surrounded.]

Ninja girl: You should have listened to my warning. There are no friends to save you down here.

Talia al Ghūl: Stop!

[She walks up to Batman and slaps him.]

Batman: Hello, Talia.

Talia al Ghūl: How did you find us?

Batman: I recognized your personal guard. It was just a matter of… …Following her.

Ninja girl: Please, mistress… He tricked me.

Talia al Ghūl: Leave. I will deal with you later. You didn’t need to get yourself arrested to see me, Bruce. After that night we spent in Metropolis, you could have just called.

Batman: I’m not here for you. Where’s Rā’s? If he’s dead again, I need you to wake him up.

Talia al Ghūl: Only a true successor may stand before the great Rā’s al Ghūl. My father always intended us to be together, to command his army. Just imagine it. You.. Me… A better world.

[She lifts up his mask and sees Bruce’s face is not extremely healthy.]

Talia al Ghūl: Your… face? What happened?

Batman: I’m here to take my place at your side.

Talia al Ghūl: You wish to become an assassin? Why should I trust this change of heart?

Batman: You saw my face. Does it look like I have a choice?

Talia al Ghūl: Are you prepared to take the Demon Trials? You must show you are willing to take a life to save the world.

Batman: I’m ready.

Talia al Ghūl: Then let the trials commence.

[She claps her hands and opens the underground passage.]

Talla al Ghūl: Thousands of warriors have fallen in pursuit of the Demon. Would-be successors have proven to be nothing more than children battling the enormity of creation.

Batman: I’ve seen worse.

Talia al Ghūl: Nothing can prepare you for what comes next. Destiny will decide your fate.

Batman: I won’t fall.

Talia al Ghūl: I have heard these words a hundred times. Let us hope you are correct. Your journey begins through this door.

Batman: Let’s get started.

Talla al Ghūl: Are you sure, Bruce? Only one man has passed this ordeal.

Batman: Are you trying to talk me out of this?

Talia al Ghūl: Of course not. I just… just want you to be certain. When the Blood of the Demon takes hold you will be on your own.

Batman: Like always.

Talia al Ghūl: Then may the spirits be kind.

[Batman walks into a small room that only has a table with a chalice on it.]

Rā’s al Ghūl: (voice) Welcome, Detective. I am the great Rā’s al Ghūl. Before you lies your first Demon Trial. Simply drink from the chalice. It is that simple.

[Without finding any trick, Batman drinks from the chalice.]

Rā’s al Ghūl: Good. Feel the Blood of the Demon course through your veins, restoring your health and twisting your will.

[Apparently, the chalice had a hallucinogenic drink in it. The wall in front of the Batman collapses, providing access to a vast location consisting of various building debris soaring in the air. A ghost of Rā’s Al Ghūl appears next to Batman.]

Rā’s al Ghūl: Your next task is simple. Follow me through this world and the trial is complete. Touch anything along the way and you will die.

[Batman completes the task.]

Rā’s al Ghūl: These tests will prove if you are strong enough to lead my forces. To save this world from the evil that is destroying it. Are you the one I have searched for, Detective? The one to succeed me? The Blood of the Demon has allowed me to live for 600 years. Imagine the good that you could do with such a gift. I can see that your body is becoming weaker. The small quantity that I have allowed you to drink will only keep you alive for a few more precious hours. It is time for you to make the ultimate decision. It is time to face me in person. Complete this final challenge and the Blood of the Demon will give you the gift of eternal life.

[Batman manages to get out of the dream world.]

Rā’s al Ghūl: (voice) You have done well, Detective. Now, come and find me. Collect your reward.

[Batman comes to the chambers of the lord of the League of Shadows himself. Talia meets him at the door.]

Talia al Ghūl: You did it.

Batman: You sound surprised.

Talia al Ghūl: Of course not. I always had faith.

Batman: Where’s Ra’s? I need to see him now. I’m running out of time.

Talia al Ghūl: Your final challenge awaits you through this door. I pray the spirits will be kind.

[They’re entering the chambers. An old man in a cloak sits by the small pool with green water.]

Batman: Rā’s al Ghūl.

Talia al Ghūl: Father.

Rā’s al Ghūl: Welcome, Detective. It is time for your final challenge. Kill me. Replace me as the Head of the Demon. It is your destiny.

Batman: I will never kill. Not even you.

Talia al Ghūl: What? You lied to me!

Batman: I needed a sample of your father’s blood. This was the only way.

Rā’s al Ghūl: Allow me to help you. Use my sword. Take it all.

Batman: No.

Rā’s al Ghūl: And that is your final answer?

[He laughs and slowly walks into the pool with green water. In a minute he comes out of the pool young and strong.]

Rā’s al Ghūl: Now, only one of us can leave this chamber alive.

Batman: We’ll see about that.

[Rā’s using his magic and teleports Batman to his dream world. Fierce battle with sands warriors and giant Rā’s begins.]

Rā’s al Ghūl: You should have killed me when you had the chance! You cannot beat us! Witness the true power of my Lazarus Pit. You should have joined us! Accept your destiny! Give in!

Batman: Never!

Talia al Ghūl: We are fated to rule this earth. To wipe it clean of the scum of humanity. Only we can do this. My father is old. His time is over. Ours is just beginning. Take his blade. Kill him. Accept your destiny. Accept our destiny.

Batman: You know I can’t do that, Talia.

Talia al Ghūl: Then, beloved, you will have to die.

Rā’s al Ghūl: You cannot defeat us! We are legion! You cannot beat us! Our numbers are too great.

Batman wins the fight. In a powerless attempt to get what he wants, Rā’s grabs his own daughter and pulls a dagger to her throat.

Talia al Ghūl: What are you doing?

Rā’s al Ghūl: Listen to me, Detective. And listen well. You will kill me. You will lead the League of Assassins. Because, If you do not join us, I will kill the only person you have ever loved.

Talia al Ghūl: This wasn’t part of the plan.

[Batman throws the sword and takes his batarang. He programs it so that it goes back to him. With this device, Batman manages to stun Rā’s and then strikes a powerful blow to the face. Pressing the famous killer against the wall Batman takes a blood sample from him.]

Rā’s al Ghūl: De-tec-tive! You should have killed me.

Talia Al Ghūl: Yes, he should have. What kind of man sacrifices his own daughter? And you. You lied to me. I thought you loved me, Bruce. I thought you were ready to join our crusade.

Batman: Talia…

Talia al Ghūl: Don’t. You two deserve each other.

[She leaves.]

Batman: You’re looking old, Ra’s. What’s really going on here?

Rā’s al Ghūl: I’ve used the Lazarus Pit too many times. I have lived 600 years. My mind and body cannot take much more. Each time I enter the pit I am frightened of what will come out.

Batman: The Lazarus Pit has corrupted your mind. Think about it. If your pit falls into the wrong hands, you will be powerless to stop centuries of destruction. This is your chance for redemption Ra’s. Call off your crusade or I’ll be back for you.

[He leaves the hideout.]

Oracle: (via radio) Bruce? Where the hell have you been? I thought you were dead.

Batman: Sorry to disappoint you.

Oracle: Did you find Ra’s? Hold on, your suit’s reading are back to normal. Are you cured? What’s going on?

Batman: Ra’s and his forces are based underneath Arkham City, extracting some kind of naturally occurring chemical he’s called “Lazarus”. He’s been using it for centuries, slowly perfecting the process until he was even able to bring himself back from the dead.

Oracle: And you took some?

Batman: He forced me to. Small doses appear to heal most ailments, but even the small amount I ingested had a few nasty side effects. Prolonged exposure has driven Ra’s over the edge.

Oracle: So, do you think you’re cured?

Batman: No. The effects are temporary. Ra’s tried to convince me to use his pit, but the risks are too great. When I’m done here, I’ll need to investigate this Lazarus technology further. I told Ra’s to shut his pit down.

Oracle: And you think he will?

Batman: Unlikely; Ra’s is addicted to the pit. I’ve given him one chance to break that addiction or I’ll be back to do it myself. Did Robin get you that blood sample?

Oracle: Yeah, he’s down at Gotham General. It’s going crazy there. I’ll patch through.

Robin: Hey, Barb, am I glad to hear from you.

Batman: It’s me. What’s happening there?

Robin: Bruce, it’s not good. Gotham General has at least thirty confirmed cases, there are nearly fifty at Mercy and it’s looking like the pattern repeats all over the city.

Oracle: I’ve run a simulation. Joker’s blood could be in as many as 2000 people by the morning. The first fatalities are expected soon after that.

Batman: I’m on my way back to Freeze right now. Hopefully the blood sample l extracted from Ra’s will complete the formula.

Oracle: I hope you’re right.

Hugo Strange: (via loudspeakers) Protocol Ten will commence in 2 hours.

Inmate: Did you see the way Penguin’s guys just ran?

Inmate: Yeah. Cobblepot’s finished here. We just need to wait, regroup, and then head into the tunnels and take out the rest of ’em.

Inmate: We own Arkham City. Screw anyone else who thinks they do.

Joker: Is that the sound of one of your faces hitting something hard? I hope so.

Inmate: I’ve found someone! C’mon. Wake up. Dammit, he’s out cold!

Inmate: How are we going to get out of here, man?

Inmate: Leave him! We’ve got more important things to be looking out for!

Inmate: Show yourself, chicken!

Joker: Someone’s missing in there. Is it you?

Inmate: You heard the Joker!

Inmate: There’s someone here!

Inmate: Wake up. Do ya hear me? Wake up!

Inmate: This is not good.

Joker: Boom! One man down. It’s looking like a re-run of last time.

Inmate: Oh this ain’t happening… I’ve got another man down over here!

[Coming out of the underground tunnels beneath Gotham, Batman meets a frighteningly familiar man…]

Killer Croc: You are not welcome here!

Batman: I’m not here to fight you, Croc. Let me pass.

Killer Croc: Your scent is… Different. I smell death on you. I don’t need to fight you, Batman. I just need to wait, and then, I will feed on your corpse.

[He swims away. Batman encounters a new group of thugs.]

Batman: They’ve started using shields. They’ll block head on attacks but that shield can’t protect them from above.

Inmate: You people have two choices. Join up with the Joker and live. Stay with the Penguin and die. Simple. So what’s it going to be?

Inmate: I’m in.

Inmate: Yeah, me too.

Inmate: Good. We’ve got weapons on the way.

Inmate: What? You expect us to join up with you unarmed?

Inmate: Screw that!

Inmate: He said, guns are on the way it won’t be long. What part of that did you not understand.

Inmate: Calm down. We’re all friends here, right?

Inmate: I guess.

Inmate: Good. Now, when the weapons arrive, we can all head topside and kill anyone that stands against the Joker. That’s not going to be a problem, is it?

Inmate: Not for me. I always fight for the winning side.

Inmate: Me too.

Inmate: Cool. Joker wants this over nice and fast. No more screwing around.

Inmate: It’s Batman!

Hugo Strange: (via loudspeakers) Citizens of Arkham. As I speak, there is a new inmate entering my facility. The more nostalgic among you will recognize him as Quincy Sharp, Mayor of Gotham and failed Warden of Old Arkham Asylum. Please provide him with the welcome he deserves.

Oracle: That doesn’t sound good, does it?

Batman: No it doesn’t.

Oracle: I don’t get it? Why would Strange arrange for the Mayor to be sent there? Scrub that. How the hell did Strange even manage to have the Mayor arrested?

Batman: I don’t know, Barbara. But I am going to find out.

[Batman stops by the museum to check on the Penguin.]

Inmate: Well look who it is little Mr. Cobblepot all locked up in his own museum.

Inmate: Did the big bad bat do this? Or was it the Cat?

Penguin: Laugh, boy. I’ll get outta here, and then you are gonna regret this.

Inmate: Really? I’ll let the boss know when he gets here.

Penguin: What!?

Inmate: Oh, sorry, didn’t I mention? Oh, sorry about that. Two-Face is on his way back. He’s got his eyes on this place to set up camp.

Penguin: He wouldn’t dare.

Inmate: Really? What’s stopping him? You?

Penguin: You tell Harvey that if he even steps one foot in this place, I’ll kill him. I’ll tear him in half, though, he’ll probably like that, won’t he? This will be the jewel in my collection. Coming soon, the Batman.

Inmate: Tell him yourself. He’ll be here soon.

[Batman beats their asses.]

Penguin: Well, look who’s back to see me. What’s up, Batman? Did a little bird tell you that Two-Face is back?

Batman: I’m surprised he didn’t kill you. What did you do? Hide?

Penguin: Who do you think you’re talking to? Oswald Cobblepot doesn’t hide from anyone! Understand! He just… He just didn’t see me, that’s all.

Batman: How convenient.

Penguin: My family used to own Gotham. It will again.

[After leaving the museum, Batman’s flying to help the mayor of Arkham.]

Inmate: Time to die! I’ve got him! He’s over here!

Inmate: Once I drag your sorry-ass to my new boss, he’ll make me his right hand man for sure.

[After defeating a big gang of thugs, Batman grabs the mayor and flies with him to the roof of the building. He hangs him upside down on a rope.]

Mayor Quincy Sharp: Please… I shouldn’t be here! No! Please. No.

Batman: I want to know all about Strange and how you’re tied into all this.

Mayor Quincy Sharp: I’ll tell you everything. Strange came to me back at the Asylum. He told me he had friends, powerful friends. The sort of people who could make things happen. All I had to do was turn a blind eye to his experiments, and work on my campaign. He said his friends would ensure that I won.

Batman: Who are they?

Mayor Quincy Sharp: No! I have no idea. I never met them. They funded everything. Money was no problem.  All I had to do was set up Arkham City and put Strange in charge; it made perfect sense. The scum of Gotham needed to be punished. It would be my legacy.

Batman: Strange has been removing anyone with evidence against him and sending them into Arkham City. Enjoy your legacy.

[He cuts the mayor loose.]

Oracle: (via radio) Bruce, I’m seeing massive spikes on your suit’s biometric analyzer. Your health… It… It doesn’t look good.

Batman: I just had a chat with our old friend Quincy Sharp. He confirmed that Strange is working with someone else. I’m going to find out who.

Oracle: What are you talking about? You need to get that blood to Freeze now.

Batman: I will. I just need to…

Oracle: No you don’t. You need to go back to the G.C.P.D. Please, Bruce. For me?

Mayor Quincy Sharp: Strange made me do it. I wanted to stop, but his drugs made me so confused.

Joker: (via phone) What are you doing, Bats? I thought we were friends, working together and all that. From where I’m lying, desperately clutching at what’s left of my life, it seems like you’ve betrayed me and started working with the walking Ice-box. Well two can play at that game. Try and get back to that double-crossing snowman in the G.C.P.D. Without my guys blowing your pointy head off. I double dare you.

Inmate: I don’t think you understand the arrangement we have, fish. You’re supposed to be the one who does what I want. Last thing I need is some ugly son of a bitch coming back here and telling me you got beaten up by someone else.

Inmate: Have you seen how many copters there are now? it’s like every day there’s more. What’s Strange up to?

Inmate: Two-Face told Guido that it’s all to hunt down Batman. Guido said we should keep out of the way in case we get mistaken for the Bat.

Inmate: I can see his point. I’ve been working out. I guess I do kinda look like Batman.

Inmate: Like hell. You look like crap.

Inmate: Lookout! It’s the Bat!

[Batman interrogates one of the thugs.]

Batman: How much do I need to hurt you?

Inmate: You don’t! I’ll talk!

Batman: That was never in doubt.

[He knocks at the door of the old GCPD building.]

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: Get the hell out of… Oh, it’s you. Door’s unlocked, man. Come on in. You came back. Cool. I guess you heard the radio.

Batman: I did. What did you find?

G.C.P.D. Officer Jones: This. Tom over there thinks it has something to do with mines. He used to work bomb disposal. Figured you could use it.

[Batman picks up the mine detonator and leaves the building.]

Batman: I’ll take a look.

Inmate: I hate all these cameras. Hate being watched all the time.

Inmate: I ain’t seen Batman for a while.

Inmate: Good. Last time he turned up he knocked three teeth out of your face. What’s up? You miss him?

Inmate: Like hell. I hope one of them copters has found and blown the crap outta him.

Inmate: We can hope, but I doubt it. Word is he took down Penguin and then vanished. Maybe he just left.

Inmate: Can you blame him? Would you still be here if you were the Bat?

Inmate: Those payphones drive me nuts. Always with the ringing.

Inmate: Bane? Maybe he’s got something to do with those crate things.

Inmate: Batman and Freeze working together. Now that’s something I didn’t expect.

Inmate: There you are, Bat. Get over here! I’ve found Batman!

TYGER Helicopter: Visual on target. I repeat, we have visual on Batman.

[Batman picks up one of the ringing payphones.]

Zsasz: Hello… Batman. Do you recognize my voice?

Batman: Victor Zsasz.

Zsasz: In the flesh. I’m so happy you remember me. I’ll never forget you. I’ve got a special game planned, Batman. A game just for you. Ring, ring.

Inmate: Look out! It’s Batman!

Inmate: What’s stopping it?

Inmate: I don’t know. It keeps freezing back up.

Inmate: It’s Freeze. He’s doing something. You got a backup plan? How are we going to get in?

Inmate: We’re not.

Inmate: I’ll tell Harley you said that.

Inmate: What?

Inmate: You heard. Quinn’s on her way over. She sounded real pissed. I don’t think Joker’s holding up too well. She’s coming over to try and hurry us up. And when she asks what’s stopping Joker getting his cure, I’m pointing at you.

Inmate: But it’s not my fault.

Inmate: You can tell her that.

Inmate: You’re kidding, right?

Inmate: Do I look like I’m kidding? No way am I taking the fall for you not being able to defrost an ice cube.

Inmate: OK, look, Just stall her. I get this thing open. Somehow.

Inmate: You need to hurry up. You don’t want to still be doing this when Quinn gets here.

Inmate: I doing my best here. It won’t open.

Inmate: C’mon. Harley’s on her way. We need to get in there.

Inmate: I’m trying, man.

Inmate: When Harley Quinn gets here. I’ll let you do the explainin’. No way am I taking the blame.

Inmate: I can’t do this with you yappin’ at me. Just shut up already.

Batman: Tell me what I want to know about Riddler, or get ready to eat through a straw!

Inmate: What’s the Bat doing here!?

Joker: Why do you keep doing this to me? It’s like you idiots spend every single day thinking up ways to leave me bitterly disappointed. Harley, when you get to the GCPD, kill a couple of ’em for me, will you, dear.

Harley Quinn: No problem, sweetie.

Joker: If any of you are still conscious, get back to base now.

THE LABORATORY OF GCPD
[Batman enters the building and hears Victor’s voice from a distance.]

Mister Freeze: I will not fail Nora. This is futile. How can this Rā’s al Ghūl hold the secret to the clown’s cure. Batman must have lost his mind. When this is over, the clown will suffer.

[Batman enters the laboratory.]

Mister Freeze: Impressive, Batman. I doubted you would actually return.

Batman: I’m a man of my word, Victor. You should know that by now.

Mister Freeze: The formula is complete. The bonding process appears to have been successful. How are you feeling? You look unwell.

Batman: Give it to me.

Mister Freeze: I’m afraid I cannot do that, Batman. You have given me your last order.

[He’s breaking the tube with the cure.]

Batman: This is not a time for negotiation.

Mister Freeze: I think it is. The clown has my wife. Bring her back to me.

[Batman’s trying to get a second tube, but Freeze shoots him with his freezing gun.]

Batman: You don’t want to do this, Freeze.

Mister Freeze: Oh, I believe I do. You will bring me Nora, or you will die!

[The battle begins with one of Batman’s smartest opponents. Mister Freeze does not forgive mistakes or allow himself to be caught on the same occasion twice.]

Mister Freeze: You are in my world now, Batman.

Batman: (via radio) Oracle, Freeze is attacking me. Get me the telemetry feed from his suit, now!

Oracle: No problem. Bruce, remember what happened last time. Don’t try and take him on in a straight up fight. He’s too powerful. OK, data’s ready. Coming through now.

Mister Freeze: Hide If you wish, Batman. I will find you and end you. No! I see you are attempting to use my weapons against me. Do you really think I will allow that? You are not safe. I will find you. I see you. NO! That is the last time that will work on me.

Batman: I can’t allow Freeze to see me. He’s too dangerous.

Mister Freeze: You cannot hide forever, Batman.

Mister Freeze: Thank you for showing me your location. I can evolve my strategies. Can you? You cannot hide in the cold, Batman. This world is mine. I warned you, Batman, you cannot hide from me. NO! That will not happen again. Your movements are all too easy to track. The clown will pay for taking my wife. This room will be your tomb. What? How?

[Batman beats Victor. When he takes a powerful blow and breaks the glass cover of Mr. Freeze’s helmet, his face turns into a Joker’s face for a second. The poison has begun to affect Batman again. He presses a few buttons on Freeze’s glove and opens the code safe.]

Mister Freeze: Please, find Nora. She is all I have left.

[The safe appears to be empty.]

Mister Freeze: It’s over. That was all I could manufacture.

Batman: Harley Quinn took it.

Mister Freeze: Then what are you waiting for? Go and get it back. The clown must pay for what he has done to us.

Batman: It’s not that simple. Joker’s got the Steel Mill locked down Getting in will not be easy.

Mister Freeze: Perhaps I can help. I’ve been working on a new projectile system. Maybe these will provide the edge you need.

Batman: I promise you, Victor, I will find Nora.

Mister Freeze: Please, find my wife. I managed to track Nora down to somewhere in this area. Please find her for me Batman.

[Batman exits the building and sees a helicopter hanging in the air and intercepts the audio signal coming from it.]

Vicki Vale: My God, our mystery caller was correct. It looks like Batman himself is exiting the building.

Joker: Is he really? Hello, Gotham, it’s me. I’m afraid Ms. Vale will soon be leaving the airwaves.

[There’s a rocket hitting the helicopter.]

Joker: We apologize for this interruption.

Vicki Vale: We’ve been hit! We’re going down! Mayday! Mayday! If anyone can hear me, we’re--

[Batman’s in a hurry to help a hapless reporter.]

Vicki Vale: Hello? Gotham! I don’t know if you can hear me, My news copter has been shot down. We’ve crashed down somewhere in Arkham City. We need help! I am now stuck on part of the old Gotham Freeway in what looks like a turf war between…

[There have been several shots fired.]

Vicki Vale: What the hell was that!? Oh God! There are snipers! They’re all around my position. I can see what look like inmates moving in on us. Please, If anyone can hear me, send help! This is Vicki Vale. I repeat this is Vicki Vale. If you can hear this, help me!

Inmate: This bitch is mine.

Inmate: Don’t speak too soon. Joker will be pissed if you screw this up.

[Batman quietly eliminates one sniper after another.]

Vicki Vale: It appears that the snipers covering my position from the South-East have gone. The roof of the Kirshen building has gone quiet. Either they’ve all left or someone has taken them out.

Inmate: I can’t see her!

Inmate: Look harder. Joker wants the reporter dead.

Inmate: Yeah, OK. I’m trying. I just can’t get a clear shot.

Vicki Vale: Gunfire has ceased from Dini Towers. I can no longer see the snipers on the roof of the apartment building. If anyone can hear this broadcast, send help, please.

[Batman approaches the reporter.]

Batman: You should be safe here for now. Stay here and keep out of sight.

Vicki Vale: Any chance I could get an exclusive? Care to tell Gotham what’s going on with your face?

Batman: No. Stay there and be quiet.

Joker: (via phone) Now, that’s no way to talk to the nice reporter lady, Bats.

Batman: What do you want?

Vicki Vale: Who are you talking to?

Joker: Now see what you’ve done? The poor woman’s all confused, Hardly surprising, I suppose. I mean, she’s just been in a terrible accident. (laughs)

Batman: That you caused.

Joker: How dare you! I’ve never been so… oh what the hell? Yes, OK, it was me. I just needed a little time to guarantee that Harley got back to me with my delicious cure and, if you’re a good boy, I may even save a little for you. It’s unlikely, I know, but I’m really your last hope now, aren’t I?

Vicki Vale: Well, Gotham. It appears I am safe, for now. I’ve just been rescued by Batman. He saved me from what felt like certain death at the hands of snipers, all working for the Joker. How did the Joker’s crew get their hands on sniper rifles in a maximum security prison? That Gotham, is a question I intend to put to Professor Strange if I ever get out of here. I have to say that I have been shocked at the conditions on the ground in this so-called prison facility. So far tonight I have witnessed armed gang, members running wild, murder and mutilation on the streets, and a complete lack of authority. We were told that Arkham City is good for Gotham. If that’s true, maybe that good comes at a price we shouldn’t have to pay. This is Vicki Vale, talking to you live and hoping she’ll stay that way, in Arkham City. C’mon, Batman. There’s more going on than meets the eye, right? Any truth to the rumors that the Joker has poisoned Gotham? What about this place? Do you approve of Professor Strange? C’mon, Batman. Give a girl a break. Do you think the Joker made the call to the network? It must have been him. He got us just where he wanted us. Thanks for the help back there. Are you sure you have no comment?

[Without saying a word, Batman shoots a hook at the next building and flies away.]

Inmate: I’m telling you, no one’s gonna be able to get close without us seeing. You could use these sniper rifles to kill ants from up here.

Inmate: We were lucky to get ’em. I heard Batman stopped the guys Joker sent down to get the last shipment.

Inmate: Tell me about it? Joker sounded pissed.

Inmate: He wants Batman dead. Let’s not disappoint him.

Inmate: We ain’t doin’ nothin! Don’t shoot!

Inmate: Huh?

Inmate: Time to die! I’ve got him! He’s over here!

Inmate: Catwoman and the plant lady. Man, those two are hot.

Inmate: Wonder what Hugo Strange had on Sharp to make him turn over control of Gotham?

Inmate: The Bat’s here!

[Batman flies to save Victor’s wife.]

Inmate: So how are we gonna decide who keeps the ice cube?

Inmate: I want her. It’s my turn. You always get your turn.

Inmate: How about rock, paper, scissors?

Inmate: Can you even play that with three people?

Inmate: Sure you can, c’mon. Let’s do it.

Inmate: One, two, three! All paper, what are the odds?

Inmate: Do I look like I went to school?

Inmate: What’s the Bat doing here!?

Batman: Freeze’s wife is safe. I should tell him.

Inmate: No one’s seen Wayne since he got in here. He’s probably dead already.

Inmate: Bruce Wayne’s billions won’t do him any good here.

Inmate: So cold.

Inmate: What the? It’s the Bat!

Inmate: I’m getting bored. I thought we were supposed to have left by now.

Inmate: Chill out, man. It’s coming. Joker wants us to move on into Two-Face’s territory. Teach that ugly son of a bitch to mess with the boss.

Inmate: It’s a miracle, ain’t it? Yesterday I figured I was a goner, today, he’s back, better than ever.

Inmate: Yeah, it’s good to see the old Joker’s smile back. It’s like there’s been this other guy standing in for him, but now the real Joker’s back.

Inmate: So, we ready?

Inmate: Soon. We wait for the order and then this whole town will know that Joker’s back.

Inmate: Soon as I grab Bruce Wayne, I’m cashing him in for a first class ticket to anyplace else.

Inmate: Someone turn on the heat.

Inmate: More snow? Damnit, end already!

Inmate: Catwoman and the plant lady. Man, those two are hot.

Inmate: I heard Bruce Wayne got put in Arkham City. I’d like to get five minutes with that rich son of a bitch.

Inmate: It’s the freakin’ Bat!

Inmate: Ain’t things bad enough here without the Bat?

Joker: Hey, Bats, it’s me. While you were saving Ms. Vale, took the liberty of beefing up security at my Steel Mill. I’m sorry to have to break it to you, but I don’t think that even you will be able to get in here. Oh, this is getting too emotional. I can barely bring myself to think of you dying out there. I keep thinking of you lying dead in the snow. It’s the only thing that brings a smile to my face.

Inmate: Oh, God. Everyone! Get your asses over here. NOW!

Inmate: There you are, Bat. Get over here! I’ve found Batman!

Inmate: What?

Inmate: It came from over here! I’m sure of it!

Inmate: And then Harley came out carrying the cure. Batman was in there fighting Freeze and she snuck behind and cut the back of the damn safe.

Inmate: Who’d a thought it. Harley Quinn outsmarting the Bat.

Inmate: Must have been Joker’s plan. No way was it hers.

Inmate: I don’t know, man. Joker was pretty out of it.

Inmate: What I don’t get, is I thought Batman was working with Freeze. That’s what Joker said earlier, right? How come they were fighting?

Inmate: You know what it’s like. Allegiances in this place are fragile at best. No way Freeze would work with Batman if he didn’t have some other thing planned.

[Batman goes back to the police lab for a while.]

Batman: I found her, Freeze. She’s safe.

Mister Freeze: Nora! Where is she?

Batman: She was locked up in warehouse 5B in the Falcone shipping yard. She’s safe, Victor. You can go to her.

Mister Freeze: Thank you, Batman. I doubted you. I am sorry. I am preparing a solution to remedy whatever damage the clown has caused my beautiful Nora. Thank you for finding Nora.

Batman: I told you I would find her.

Mister Freeze: Thank you, Batman. I am sorry I doubted you.

Batman: Just fix her and quit this life. You’re better than this.

Mister Freeze: Thank you for this.

[Batman returns to the city again.]

Batman: Someone’s ignited a distress flare on this rooftop. Either someone inside needs my help or it’s a trap.

Inmate: Hope Strange is keeping nice and warm up in that tower of his.

Inmate: Batman! It’s Batman!

Inmate: Where are my damn smokes? I thought I told you to go and get me some. What happened?

Political Prisoner: I couldn’t find any. Please. It’s not my fault!

Inmate: I don’t see anyone else here! You’re the one who didn’t do what he was told to do. So I guess you’re the one whose gonna starting hurting.

Political Prisoner: On, please, no!

Inmate: Shut up! I’m gonna enjoy this.

Political Prisoner: Help!

Inmate: There’s no way Batman’s getting back in this place.

Inmate: Front doors are sealed and Joker even fired up the furnaces so he can’t come back in through the chimneys.

Inmate: He’ll come here, look around for a new route in and we’ll kill him while he’s looking.

Inmate: I can’t believe it. Look at us, Joker’s back and we’re armed to the teeth. Won’t be long and we’ll own Arkham City again.

Inmate: And when we’ve killed everyone who stands against Joker, we’ll tear down the walls to this place and show Gotham not to mess with Joker.

Inmate: It’ll be sweet. Hold on? Why don’t Batman just go round the back and go in there? I mean, it’s dangerous and all but this is Batman, right?

Inmate: Joker’s way ahead of you. He’s got an entire team back there. Soon as they see him, Batman’s dead. He won’t see it coming.

Inmate: Now shut up and keep a look out! He could already be here.

Political Prisoner: Someone! Help me!

Inmate: I ain’t been round this neighborhood since ten years ago. Still stinks.

Inmate: Huh?

Political Prisoner: Help me!

Inmate: They’re letting us starve. I know it.

[Batman has been exploring the Steel Mill for some time. The number of guards are really increased so he has to act very cautiously.]

Batman: The furnace is generating too much heat. I need to find another way in.

Batman: (via radio) Oracle, find me a route into the Steel Mill.

Oracle: Let’s see. I’m assuming you want the most dangerous route possible.

Batman: Why change things now?

Oracle: Well you’re in luck. The only other way in is via the heat exchanges to the south of the building. I’ll mark it on your map.

Inmate: Do you think he’s really coming?

Inmate: Who, Batman? ’Course he is.

Inmate: Nah, I reckon Freeze got him. He’s stuck in a block of a block of ice about now.

Inmate: Yeah. Freeze must be pretty pissed, right? I mean, Joker stole his wife, threatened to pull the plug. No way was Freeze going to forget that.

Inmate: How the hell do you know that?

Inmate: Joker had me drag Freeze’s lady to a van. No idea where she ended up.

Inmate: Did you see what she looked like? Is she hot?

Inmate: She’s in a block of ice.

Inmate: If you thawed her out would she be hot?

Inmate: Way I understand it, if she thaws out, she’s dead, But, to answer your question, yes, she’s kind of good looking in a near dead frozen sort of way I guess.

Inmate: Nice.

Inmate: What’s wrong with you?

Inmate: There ain’t nothing wrong with me. I’ve just been stuck in this place so long, that if a half-attractive piece of skirt comes my way, I’m not bothered if she’s a little cold. Know what I mean?

Inmate: There you are, Bat. Get over here! I’ve found Batman!

Inmate: Think you can hide from me? Grenade!

Inmate: What?

Inmate: Leave me alone, Batman! Please.

Joker: Do I have to do everything myself around here? All asked was that you stopped the stupid Batman.

[Batman beats a whole crowd of scumbags guarding the smelter entrance.]

SIONIS STEEL MILL
Inmate: Whatever. You know anything about Protocol Ten? Sounds scary.

Inmate: Yeah, I was on the phone with professor Strange yesterday and he told me what it is.

Inmate: Really? What is it?

Inmate: You as stupid as you look? Why would I be calling the guy who runs this place?

Inmate: Lookout! It’s the Bat!

Oracle: (via radio) I just heard from my dad, he’s been summoned to City Hall. Strange is requesting that Emergency Protocol Ten is activated.

Batman: Does Gordon know what Protocol Ten is?

Oracle: Just that it’s the worse case security measure. Strange told the High Council he had failed to stem the use of illegal weapons within the prison.

Batman: Weapons he provided. This was his plan all along.

Oracle: It certainly looks that way. He made it sound like the Inmates were planning a mass escape and attack on Gotham I’ll keep you posted.

Inmate: Did you see the Joker just now?

Inmate: Yeah, he looked OK, didn’t he?

Inmate: Yeahs How the hell did that happen? I saw him yesterday and he looked like poisoned crap. Today? All good.

Inmate: So did he find a cure or what?

Inmate: Don’t know. Last thing I heard was the doctors couldn’t save him. Quinn even had me torture some lady doctor to find a cure.

Inmate: What did she say?

Inmate: Right up to the moment she died, she was still saying there was no cure. After that, not so much.

Inmate: Well, who cares? He’s back. The Joker’s back.

Inmate: It’s the freakin’ Bat!

[Having defeated another bunch of scumbags, Batman finds a huge TV, through which the Joker communicates with his man.]

Joker: Good evening, troops. This is General J with a quick update on what’s going on down here in Arkham City. As you can see, I’m looking much better. In fact… think I’m looking better than ever. I can hear you all now: "How did this happen?" "Can I get me some of that crazy cure?" "I want answers, damn it! Now!" Well here’s the thing. Answers don’t give you everlasting satisfaction. Sometimes you need to brace yourself for disappointment. Think about it. Imagine your favorite TV show. You’ve been through it all. The ups, the downs, the crazy coincidences, and then: Bang! They tell you what it’s all about. Would you be happy? Does it make sense? How come it all ended in a church? You guys just need to know one simple thing. I’m back. Back for good. Now arm yourselves, boys. We’ve got a prison break to plan. No hostages. No surrender. Oh, I know. It sounds like suicide, but listen. Whatever happens. I’ll be right behind you.

[In the next room, Batman sees two Joker men torture someone.]

Inmate: Let me explain to you what’s going on: The Joker is winning. You and your boss are losing. Now, we want the Joker to keep winning so you’re going to tell us everything we need to know about Two-Face’s plans.

Inmate: It’s Batman!

Inmate: Hope he breaks your freakin’ legs, you bastards. Please, get me down from here!

[Batman helps him, but the prisoner still attacks him.]

Oracle: (via radio) I’ve hacked into the Council CCTV. The council members are coming back. They don’t look happy. They’re telling Strange that they are disappointed in him, that they never believed Protocol Ten would need to be activated.

Batman: But they gave him permission, didn’t they?

Hugo Strange: (via loudspeakers) Good evening. Protocol Ten will commence in 30 minutes. You all have specific orders for this situation: follow them.

Oracle: (via radio) Do you still need an answer? Bruce, I don’t like this. Be careful.

[Batman pushes a button on one of Harley’s dolls.]

Harley Quinn: (recorded) I’m sorry, bozo, I can’t come to the phone right now. I’m probably off doing something top secret for Mister J, so I can’t tell you what it is. All you need to know is that you should be doing some work and keeping the Steel Mill free of bat infestations. Understand?

[Walking down the narrow corridor, Batman uses his special vision to notice a man standing around the corner with a bat. He abruptly blocks the blow, shocking the attacker. The attacker’s appear to be Dr. Baker.]

Dr. Stacy Baker: Oh God. It’s you! I’m sorry.

Batman: It’s alright. You’re safe.

Dr. Stacy Baker: You’re lucky! I could have killed you with this thing.

Batman: Believe me, doctor. When someone takes a swing at me with a pipe, they don’t get the chance to apologize. What’s been happening?

Dr. Stacy Baker: I did what you said. I stayed out of sight and kept an eye on what they were up to.

Dr. Stacy Baker: They’ve been placing things on the floor in the room next door. I don’t know what they are.

Batman: Sounds like Joker’s trying to stop me with mines.

Dr. Stacy Baker: Will it work?

Batman: Do I look worried?

Dr. Stacy Baker: Worried? No. Sick? Very. You look terrible.

Batman: Don’t worry about me. Get back to wherever you’ve been hiding. I’ll deal with the mines.

[The next room gives Batman a severe test of his skills. The whole room is dotted with mines, so it’s hard to move around and there’s a bunch of scumbags walking around.]

Inmate: And I did what he said. Man, you shoulda seen his face.

Inmate: That’s funny, man.

Inmate: And then what? Did she do it?

Inmate: Course she did. I mean look at me, I’m gorgeous!

Inmate: So what’s the deal with J? He looks better, right?

Inmate: It’s a freakin’ miracle. Yesterday he looked like crap, today the real Joker’s back.

Batman: That thug’s armed with proximity mines.

Joker: Boom! One man down. It’s looking like a re-run of last time.

Inmate: You heard the boss!

Inmate: I’ve got the door!

Inmate: They were right. I’ve found someone!

Inmate: I’ve got this way covered!

Inmate: This is no good. He won’t wake up!

Inmate: How’s he keep doing this? What’s going on?

Inmate: Shut the hell up. We need to keep looking or we’re all dead!

Inmate: What’s wrong?! Too scared to show yourself?!

Inmate: What?

Inmate: Get over and find out who’s screaming!

Inmate: I’ve found another one!

Inmate: What the hell’s going on here!

Inmate: Over here! NOW! I’ve found someone!

Inmate: What’s going on here? That ain’t supposed to be happening.

Inmate: He was actually telling the truth. The mines don’t blow us up.

Inmate: Oh, God. Everyone! Get your asses over here. NOW!

Inmate: Show yourself, chicken!

Inmate: How’s he doing this?

Inmate: Leave him! We’ve got more important things to be looking out for!

Joker: I’m just dying to see which one of you losers Batman takes out first. Let me see, eenie meene, miney, mo.

Inmate: What the hell is going on?

Inmate: Mine in position. Priming now!

Inmate: It came from over here! I’m sure of it!

Inmate: C’mon, where are you?

Joker: Someone’s missing in there. Is it you?

Inmate: You heard the Joker!

Inmate: Man down! Man down!

Joker: Well, what do you know? You did it. You took ’em all out. I should be sad, I suppose, but the truth is, I’m happy. Happier than I’ve been in years. How about you?

Hugo Strange: (via loudspeakers) Protocol Ten will commence in 20 minutes.

Inmate: I hear you, buddy.

Inmate: How’s it going in there anyway?

Inmate: It’s all good. I’m in position, the room’s mined and If see Batman… BOOM!

Inmate: Hope you’re right. The Joker looks like he’s getting ready for a war. If Batman’s out of the picture, we may actually win it.

Inmate: I’ve worked out how to beat the Bat. He uses the gargoyles, right? I just need to take them out too. Boom!

Inmate: Batman’s on the ground and I’m putting a bullet through his brain.

Inmate: Nice. Let me know when he’s dead. I want to come down there and have a little fun with the corpse.

Inmate: Get in line. I’m having the mask. You can have what’s left.

Inmate: It’s the Bat!

[Batman approaches the long tied up Harley Quinn and undo the most useful accessory in her wardrobe - sticky tape on her mouth.]

Harley Quinn: Well look who it is. What do you want, B-man? Come to stick the knife in some more? Well go on then, don’t care. I’m not telling you nothin’! I’m not even going to tell you about the crap Joker took from Freeze and locked up in the boiler room. What are you…

[Batman puts the sticky tape back to its rightful place. And then he comes up with an interesting idea. He decides to piss Harley off a little by putting the tape on and off.]

Harley Quinn: What? Did you have fun beating up a defenseless girl? Don’t you dare… Stop that! What are you… If you don’t stop doing that, I’m gonna tell Mister J and he’s gonna… well, he’s gonna be mad.

Inmate: You heard all that Protocol Ten bull that Strange has been spouting?

Inmate: What the hell is his problem? Didn’t he give us these guns in the first place?

Inmate: Yeah, I thought he wanted the Joker to win.

Inmate: Me too, but, don’t you think that’s kind of crazy? Who spends billions of dollars building a prison and then gives everyone guns?

Inmate: What’s the Bat doing here!?

Inmate: How the hell are we going to find Harley stuck in this elevator?

Inmate: I thought she went off to get something from Freeze.

Inmate: She did. Then she came back.

Inmate: Then why are we searching for her?

Inmate: She probably just got lost. You know what she’s like. Still, at least J’s looking better.

Inmate: Yeah, man. For weeks he’s been locked up in that little room, killing all the doctors who can’t fix him, and then suddenly he’s all good,

Inmate: Jimmy said he just saw him heading out somewhere.

Inmate: Jimmy’s full of crap. I just saw him over in the Funhouse.

Inmate: Really? Weird. Guess Jimmy needs to stop drinking that stuff he found down in the storage rooms. It must be screwin’ with his head.

Inmate: We’re moving! Thank God.

Inmate: Why ain’t the power back on?

Inmate: Who cares? We’re movin’.

Inmate: And then she said, "there’s no way I’m putting all that in my mouth!"

Inmate: Man, that’s funny. What happened next?

Inmate: Not much. She choked to death.

Inmate: Man, you must have really hated your mother.

Inmate: Like you wouldn’t believe.

Inmate: And she ate it all?

Inmate: Didn’t give her much choice.

Inmate: Killing your own mother with a poison birthday cake. Jeez.. and I thought Joker was bad.

Inmate: We’re going up! Why are we going up?

Inmate: It’s not me. I ain’t doin’ it!

Inmate: So, do you know what’s wrong with the Joker?

Inmate: No idea.

Inmate: Alright! Woo! Yeah, look at that! Right in the kisser!

Inmate: Where does the boss get these things from?

Inmate: Doesn’t he get them from Penguin?

Inmate: No way, man. Those two hate each other.

Inmate: Really?

Inmate: Are you serious? Everyone knows they hate each other.

Inmate: So where do the guns come from then?

Inmate: How the hell should know?

Inmate: I’m telling you, the Joker knows where to get the best Screw the bird-man.

Inmate: It’s the Bat!

[Eventually, Batman finds the room where the Joker is. He looks at his disfigured face in the mirror and tries to paint his lips.]

Batman: Where is it?

Joker: Manners cost nothing, Batman A please wouldn’t go amiss. I mean… If you wanted to be cured so badly, you only had to ask. It looks like I need to teach you some respect.

[When the Joker turns, we see that his face is normal. Only his reflection is disfigured.]

Batman: There’s nothing you can teach me, Joker.

Joker: Oh, come on. There’s always something to learn. Let’s start with "Getting your ass kicked 101". Seconds out!

[He’s calling Batman to a fist fight.]

Joker: Just you and me, Batman.

[Having received several blows, the Joker asks for mercy.]

Joker: Please…stop. I can’t take anymore. You win! You beat me. Hang on, did I say me? I meant me… and these guys! Let’s give a big hand to Mr. Abramovici. I mean, it’s not like he couldn’t use one.

Abramovici: I will leave you smeared across this room!

Joker: On, Batman. This is getting boring. Maybe a little TITAN will spice things up.

Abramovici: I will crush every bone in your body!

[Batman wins everyone and gives the Joker a crushing blow. He falls to the floor.]

Joker: What are you waiting for?

[Suddenly a part of the ceiling with badly hung railway tracks collapses. Batman ends up buried under the rubble. The Joker takes out a knife and goes to his sworn enemy.]

Joker: Any last requests? How about a joke?

Talia al Ghūl: How about a trade? Let him go. Take me in his place.

Joker: I’ll handle the jokes around here.

Batman: Talia, what are you doing?

Talia al Ghūl: I represent the great Rā’s al Ghūl, Head of the Demon, master of the League of Assassins.

Joker: Well, bully for you.

Talia al Ghūl: Free Batman and we will give you the secret of immortality.

Batman: Don’t do it, Talia. He’ll be unstoppable.

Joker: What? You mean she’s telling the truth. Immortal?

Talia al Ghūl: Do we have a deal?

Batman: No!

Joker: Oh, shut up!

[He kicks lying on the floor Batman.]

Joker: After you, my dear.

Talia al Ghūl: We offered you this chance, Batman. Now follow your heart.

[She activates a bug on her chest.]

The Cat and the Plant
Catwoman: Are we not done yet, Ivy? I told you, that thing with the flowers wasn’t my fault. You know it, I know it.

Poison Ivy: You should have watered them. You said you would water them. Now there’s only one left and Strange has it, sealed in his vault.

Catwoman: Well, in that case, I think we can strike a deal. I need a way into his vault and I think you’re just the girl to help. If you get me in there, I’ll get your plant. Deal?

Poison Ivy: I should kill you.

[Catwoman smiles.]

Poison Ivy: FINE!

Catwoman: No kiss? I’m kind of disappointed.

Poison Ivy: OUT! NOW!

[Catwoman goes into the town.]

Inmate: Heard Batman and Freeze were having some kind of epic fight back there. Man, I woulda paid to see that fight.

Inmate: Rumor is, Batman’s sick just like the Joker. One of the guys saw him earlier and said his face looked like crap.

Inmate: Batman’s? Do you think it’s catching? Are we all gonna get it too?

Inmate: What was that?

Inmate: You’re dead now, bitch! She’s over here!

Inmate: You sure about that? You don’t look too good either.

Inmate: I’m fine. I’ve always looked like this. My mom says that’s what makes me special.

TYGER Guard: Call it in. TYGER command. We’re in sector 2. We were attacked. The vault is compromised. We believe the attacker was Poison Ivy. Over.

[Catwoman deals with them and descends into the sewers.]

Catwoman: There’re Ivy’s vines… and there’s the storage facility. Nice work, Red. Time to get in there. OK, there’s the vault. Looks like a standard 3 card security protocol. Really, you’d think these people would have learned by now. Hopefully, the keys are down there, deep in the pockets of those TYGER guards. I’ll need to be quick and stay out of sight. One wrong move and the failsafes will trigger and that vault will locked down: permanently. That’s all the keys. Next stop, the security room.

TYGER Guard: What’s going on?

TYGER Guard: Someone’s opening the vault.

TYGER Guard: Is this a drill?

TYGER Guard: If it is, no one told us. Listen up! The room is hot. Spread out and search for intruders. No prisoners. Move!

TYGER Guard: I don’t like this. Do you think it’s Batman?

TYGER Guard: I hope not. We’ve got special orders for him. With any luck, it’s just some Arkham scum trying to get rich. We can have a little fun with them.

TYGER Guard: No sign of target.

Hugo Strange: Check your numbers.

TYGER Guard: Casualty!

TYGER Guard: Target spotted.

TYGER Guard: Moving to cover location.

Hugo Strange: Three against one.

TYGER Guard: This is TYGER 54. We have confirmation that target is in the Steel. I repeat: Batman is in the Steel Mill.

Hugo Strange: Good. Make it our first target. Protocol Ten will wipe both the Batman and the Joker from this earth.

TYGER Guard: Target is set.

Hugo Strange: Then let Protocol Ten commence.

TYGER Guard: Understood.

TYGER Guard: Commencing in 3… 2… 1…

Catwoman: Looks like this kitten’s got the cream.

[She breaks into a safe and picks up Ivy’s orchid.]

Catwoman: Try and tie me up in your plants, like hell.

[She drops the orchid on the floor like it was an accident.]

Catwoman: Oh, does that hurt much, Ivy?

[She’s much more interested in valuable things in the safe. While she’s examining them, she’s surrounded.]

Hugo Strange: (via loudspeaker) It appears we have caught our intruder. Teach her a lesson. Oh, tonight just keeps getting better. Batman will soon be dead and now I have you too Miss Kyle.

TYGER Guard: All units. We have visual confirmation. The Steel Mill is hit. Batman is down, I repeat Batman is down.

Hugo Strange: Good. Wait until Protocol Ten has completed and send out a squad to retrieve the Batman’s body.

TYGER Guard: Understood, sir.

Catwoman: (to herself) You can do it. Just walk right out of here and leave him. It’s easy. You’ll never forgive yourself, Selina. Save Batman then get out of here. It’s not like he’ll die, it’s Batman, right?

[Catwoman faces a difficult choice.]

Catwoman: Screw him.

[The game ends. Credits rolling. Othe white background we hear Barbara’s voice.]

Oracle: Can anyone hear me? My name is Barbara Gordon. We are under attack. Joker’s forces are too strong. My father is dead. Hell, everyone’s dead. We’re going to lose. Wayne Manor has been compromised. Joker’s won. I can’t believe I am saying this. He’s won. There’s nothing we can do. Bruce is dead. He’s gone. They’re all gone. If you can hear this… Send help. Please…

[But… of course it was a dark joke. The time rewinds.]

TYGER Guard: All units. We have visual confirmation. The Steel Mill is hit. Batman is down, I repeat Batman is down.

Hugo Strange: Good. Wait until Protocol Ten has completed and send out a squad to retrieve the Batman’s body.

TYGER Guard: Understood, sir.

Catwoman: (to herself) You can do it. Just walk right out of here and leave him. It’s easy. You’ll never forgive yourself, Selina. Save Batman then get out of here. It’s not like he’ll die, it’s Batman, right?

[Catwoman faces a difficult choice.]

Catwoman: Since when did you grow a conscience ? Do I have to do everything around here? Don’t die, Batman, I’m coming to save you. Great. See what I give up for you, Batman. You’d better not be dead already.

[She’s running to the place where Batman and the Joker fought.]

Catwoman: Well, what do we have here? Figured you could use my help.

Batman: You’re right, I think I chipped a nail back there,

Catwoman: You stick with the brooding, I’ll handle the wisecracks. I guess we both know what Protocol Ten is now, right? If you’re planning on stopping it, you need to hurry.

Batman: (via radio) Oracle, Strange is launching missile strikes on Arkham City from Wonder Tower. You shut this place down; Joker’s taken Talia, I’m going after them.

Oracle: You can’t. Hundreds will be killed. I need your help to stop the attack.

Batman: He’ll kill Talia.

Alfred: You need to think this through. Batman can’t let all these people die.

Batman: My tracker’s not activating. Re-route all Wayne-Tech satellites to boost the signal.

Alfred: I can’t do that. I realize it is difficult, sir, but you need to decide if one life is worth sacrificing to save a thousand?

Batman: Don’t do this, Alfred.

Alfred: Batman must save Gotham. I’m sorry, but deep down, you know I’m right.

Batman: Oracle, do not lose Talia’s signal. OK, the tower’s locked down. No way in without the codes. One of the choppers will be carrying the master control program. I just need to find that chopper.

[Batman flies through town checking the on-board computers on the helicopters. Meanwhile the helicopters executing Protocol 10 orders and  destroy the criminals in Arkham City.]

TYGER Helicopter: Multiple targets down. Body count is high.

TYGER Helicopter: Hit successful. Inmate targets neutralized.

TYGER Helicopter: We have multiple casualties.

TYGER Helicopter: Hit successful. Multiple inmate casualties!

TYGER Helicopter: Target is hit.

TYGER Helicopter: Targets are all nit. Casualties in Sector One are topping one hundred.

TYGER Helicopter: Multiple targets down. Body count is high.

TYGER Helicopter: We have Batman in sight.

TYGER Helicopter: Target Batman has disappeared, we have no visual.

TYGER Helicopter: Hit successful. Inmate targets neutralized.

TYGER Helicopter: Targets are all hit. Sector Four is it up like a Christmas tree.

TYGER Helicopter: Thermal scans of the area are showing fifteen… no… seventeen casualties.

TYGER Helicopter: I’m showing multiple hits in Sector Two.

TYGER Helicopter: Casualties in Sector Three are high. Returning to base.

Batman: I’ve got the code. I’m heading to Wonder Tower.

Oracle: (via radio) Good. You’re doing the right thing. The code should let you enter via the guard room near the main gate.

Batman: Don’t lose Talia’s signal. When I’m finished in the tower, I’m going after her. She doesn’t know Joker, she’s out of her depth. I need to save her.

TYGER Guard: AIR TYGER 5 to command. We have visual on a distress flare on a rooftop in the East Arkham district. How should we proceed?

Alfred: (via radio) Good news, Master Bruce: I believe we have identified the cure. Mr. Fox has manufactured enough to heal you and is working on a larger batch for the people of Gotham. The Batwing has been dispatched and it should be within your vicinity shortly. I’m sure I don’t need to remind you to not waste any time in taking it.

TYGER Helicopter: Target is hit.

TYGER Helicopter: Hit successful. Multiple inmate casualties.

TYGER Helicopter: Multiple targets down. Body count is high.

TYGER Helicopter: Boom. Scratch 20 more inmates.

TYGER Helicopter: Multiple targets acquired… and neutralized.

TYGER Helicopter: Hit successful. Inmate targets neutralized.

TYGER Helicopter: Multiple targets down. Body count is high.

TYGER Helicopter: All targets are lit. I repeat we have multiple successful strikes, all on target.

TYGER Helicopter: Missile locked. Structure is hit.

TYGER Helicopter: Targets are all hit. Sector Four is it up like a Christmas tree.

TYGER Helicopter: Targets are all hit. Casualties in Sector One are topping one hundred.

TYGER Guard: This is unit 42. We have apprehended the 3 escaped new inmates. They were heading for the underground tunnel system.

Political Prisoner: Please! Don’t do it again!

THE TOWER
[Batman goes to Hugo Strange’s tower and hacks the lock.]

Batman: Those TYGER guards have stun sticks. I need to attack from behind to avoid being hit.

Hugo Strange: (via loudspeaker) Hold them in processing. We will let you know when we are ready to move them down to the execution chamber.

[After Batman defeats the guards, Hugo Strange himself appears on the huge TV screen. He holds some black guy hostage with a syringe to his neck.]

Hugo Strange: Stop right there, Batman. We need to talk and I know you wouldn’t be able to live with yourself if your actions caused this poor man to die. I have a question for you. Before my arrival, this city was drowning under a tide of filth. Had you ever considered that all this is your fault? Your presence creates these animals; like germs, they spread. You created the environment that allowed the germ to mutate, to become stronger. Look at the Joker. Would he even exist if not for you? It must be depressing. All your sacrifices and yet, you are the one to blame. Oh, this is beautiful. We have at long last defeated the great Batman. Soon, I will take my rightful place at my master’s side. We will rule over this world. So thank you, Batman, for all your help. Now, kill him!

[Batman is surrounded by several heavily armed guards. He throws a smoke bomb on the floor and begins to brutally deal with them one by one.]

Hugo Strange: Fight back. Stop him! Break his spirit.

Political Prisoner: Did you see that? He took ’em all down.

Hugo Strange: A pointless effort, Dark Knight. You cannot stop the inevitable. I will rain down fire and brimstone on these animals.

Hugo Strange: (pre-recorded) While in my custody, you will follow the rules of Arkham City to the letter. Rule 1: Do not approach the security wall surrounding the facility. Any attempt to approach the wall will be considered an act of escape and will be met with extreme force. Rule 2: All prisoners must surrender themselves for full psychiatric examination when requested. Failure to surrender will be met with extreme force followed by a level nine and ten psychiatric profiling. Rule 3: TYGER operatives have full jurisdiction in Arkham City. If for any reason a TYGER operative approaches or issues an order to you, you must immediately adopt a kneeling position and place both hands on the back of your head. Failure to adopt this position will be considered an aggressive response and will be met with extreme force. These rules are mandatory and by the power vested in me, by the people of Gotham City, lawful.

Fiona Wilson: It’s you.

Batman: I told you I’d be back.

Fiona Wilson: Well, you took your time. It’s crazy back there. First, the Joker’s men came down here and started setting up camp. I did what you said and hid, but…

Batman: What happened?

Fiona Wilson: There were guards. You know, the ones that work for Strange. They came down and started killing everyone. It was a bloodbath.

Batman: It sounds like Strange is trying to cover his tracks. You seem to be good at hiding, doctor. Stay here and do it again. I’ll deal with the guards in that room.

TYGER Guard: That’s the last one. Area secure!

TYGER Guard: TYGER 43 to tower. The room is secure. All new inmates are neutralized.

Hugo Strange: Well done. Protocol Ten is progressing beautifully.

TYGER Guard: Moving to cover location.

TYGER Guard: Man down.

Hugo Strange: As we move into the final stage of Protocol Ten, I would like to congratulate all TYGER forces on this wonderful achievement. As I look at the screens in front of me I can see that we are rapidly approaching fatalities of twenty two percent. My projections show that within three hours, every single inmate of Arkham City will be dead and Protocol Ten will move into stage two. By the end of the month, new camps in Keystone and Metropolis will open; each modeled after Arkham City. You should all be proud of you part in this. We are the solution this world needs. We are the future.

TYGER Guard: Move it.

TYGER Guard: Casualty. My location.

TYGER Guard: Target spotted above us at my location. Target is moving above us.

Hugo Strange: Check your numbers.

TYGER Guard: Move it.

Hugo Strange: He’s taken one of you imbeciles out. Months of training and still you fail to beat the Batman. This is unacceptable.

[Batman hacks a secret elevator and moves to the top of the tower.]

Hugo Strange: What do you think you are doing, Wayne? You cannot stop me. I have won. Within the hour, every single piece of criminal scum will burn, and then I will turn my attention to your allies. I will march to Wayne Manor, I will drag your faithful butler through the streets of Gotham and I will make him tell the world how you have failed. My Arkham City experiment is a success and you… you will kneel before me, begging for your life.

Elevator Announcer: Arriving at the Observation Deck.

TYGER Guard: Elevator’s hot. Cover the door!

TYGER Guard: Yes, sir.

TYGER Guard: When the door opens, kill anyone in the elevator.

TYGER Guard: What if it’s one of us?

TYGER Guard: It’s not. Control says that it’s Batman.

TYGER Guard: Nice. Locked and loaded. Open the doors!

TYGER Guard: Fire!

TYGER Guard: Elevator clear!

TYGER Guard: You sure? Check again.

TYGER Guard: It’s empty. We’re good.

TYGER Guard: Understood. Hold this position.

[Meanwhile, Batman was hiding on the roof of the elevator. He carefully went down, quietly stunning the two guards, and dealt with the rest.]

Hugo Strange: Talk to me.

Command Center: Stage one has been completed, sir. Casualties are exceeding predictions at the primary locations.

Hugo Strange: Good. Refocus your attacks on the Museum. I want Cobblepot’s fortress leveled.

Command Center: Affirmative, Professor Strange.

TYGER Guard: Sir. Initial bombardment of the museum has been completed. Target is not destroyed.

Hugo Strange: How very disappointing. Prepare to fire again. I want that museum gone, Captain.

Oracle: (via radio) You’re running out of time. Strange is killing everyone in that place.

Batman: I’m nearly at the top. I’ll stop him.

Oracle: I know. How did he ever manage all this? He’s killed hundreds of people and he’s got full authorization from the city. It’s insane.

Batman: He’s working with someone. I intend to find out who the moment I stop Protocol Ten.

TYGER Helicopter: TYGER command, we’re at the tower, no sign of Batman.

Hugo Strange: Continue your search.

TYGER Helicopter: Affirmative. Sweeping the tower.

TYGER Helicopter: No sign of Batman on the tower, sir.

Hugo Strange: Good. Perhaps he has fallen. Move your search to the lower sections.

TYGER Helicopter: Affirmative, command.

Hugo Strange: Do not let your guard down. You have all read my reports. Use that data to defeat him. This is the dawn of a new age for Gotham City. Protocol Ten will wipe the scum from this city.

[Batman climbs to the very top of the tower, the office of Professor Strange. There is security to the brim.]

Hugo Strange: You should be proud. A new day has arrived. A new Gotham will be born.

[Hugo Strange notices that his guards began to disappear.]

Hugo Strange: He is making fools of you all!

TYGER Guard: Casualty!

TYGER Guard: Any one got eyes on target?

Hugo Strange: He will ruin everything. Find and stop the Batman. Do not fail me. Batman is in there with you. Stop him!

TYGER Guard: Target is still missing.

Hugo Strange: You are nothing to me, Batman. You hide behind that mask but I shall rip it from your broken face and show the world what truly lies beneath it. You are all supposed to be better than this. He is but one man. Stop him! Work together. Do not allow him to defeat you.

TYGER Guard: Casualty!

Hugo Strange: He is in that room with you. Somewhere.

TYGER Guard: Report. Any contact?

Hugo Strange: I am the future of Gotham. I am its new leader.

TYGER Guard: Huh?

TYGER Guard: Target spotted. Target is moving this way.

Hugo Strange: Batman’s over there! Batman is here. Do not underestimate him.

Hugo Strange: Can you hear me, Mr. Wayne? Of course you can. Understand this: You cannot defeat me. I am untouchable. I know you are there. You cannot escape here.

[Finally, Batman hacks the lock in Professor Strange’s office.]

Hugo Strange: You have not won. You cannot win. I, Hugo Strange, am your successor. I have saved Gotham.

Batman comes close to him and smack him with his head. Then he kicks him so hard that Hugo flies across the table.

Batman: (via radio) Oracle. Shut this place down.

Oracle: My pleasure.

[The professor tries to sluggishly resist, but he cannot cope with the Dark Knight.]

Hugo Strange: You’ve ruined everything. Get your hands off me!

[Batman presses him against the glass. The city outside the window burns with a bright flame.]

Batman: Look at what you’ve done.

Hugo Strange: It’s glorious, isn’t it?

Batman: You’re finished, Strange.

Hugo Strange: I have powerful friends, Batman. This is just the beginning. You cannot stop me, soon I will command forces beyond your comprehension. I’ve achieved what the great Batman could never do. Gotham will forever thank Hugo…

[At this point, someone pierces the professor with a skillfully decorated saber.]

Hugo Strange: Strange?

Rā’s al Ghūl: Your part in this is over, Professor Strange.

Hugo Strange: Why? I did everything you wanted.

Rā’s al Ghūl: Indeed. You clearly demonstrated that Batman is better than you. Let him die, Detective.

Batman: He was your puppet, Rā’s. Why?

Hugo Strange: You said I could replace you. This was… our vision.

Rā’s al Ghūl: And you failed to see it through.

Hugo Strange: But…

Rā’s al Ghūl: When you came to me with Batman’s identity, I gave you this chance to prove your worth, providing you with limitless resources for your plan. You came close, but you have failed me.

Batman: He’s going to die Rā’s. He needs medical attention: now!

Rā’s al Ghūl: Do as you wish, Detective. He is already dead to me.

Hugo Strange: I’m so close. Just give me more time.

Rā’s al Ghūl: Too late. I don’t give second chances. This is a good day, Detective.

Batman: Good? People are dying!

Rā’s al Ghūl: The world will not miss them, why should you? Look at my work. You may have defeated Strange but this, this is just the beginning. Come with me, we will wipe this world clean.

Batman: Never. You’re wrong, Ra’s. You’ve become what you’ve always fought against, and I will stop you.

Rā’s al Ghūl: (laughs) I doubt it.

Hugo Strange: Computer: Activate… Protocol… 11…

Rā’s al Ghūl: What are you doing?

Hugo Strange: Pass… code:.. Wayne. (dies)

Rā’s al Ghūl: No. No, no, no…

Oracle: (via radio) GET OUT OF THERE!

[Batman and Rā’s al Ghūl are thrown out of the room by explosion. They have a brief fight in the air. Rā’s al Ghūl tries to pierce himself and Batman with his saber, but Batman dodges. Rā’s al Ghūl falls on the sharp part of the city’s emblem and dies.]

Oracle: (via radio) Bruce? Are you OK? The tower just exploded.

Batman: I noticed.

Oracle: Thank God you’re alright.

Batman: Rā’s al Ghūl was the power behind Hugo Strange. This whole place was part of his plan.

Oracle: You’re kidding? Where is he now?

Batman: Let’s just say he’s going to need a trip to a Lazarus Pit.

Joker: (via loudspeakers) Hello! Is anyone there?

Batman: I’ll get back to you. Something’s come up.

Joker: Hello, Batman. I know you can hear me. I’ve not caught you at a bad time, have I? I was worried that you may have forgotten about little old me. Take a look at your girlfriend, who, as you can see, is in danger of having her pretty little brains splattered all over this camera.

Talia al Ghūl: Ignore him, beloved. Let him die!

Joker: Ah, how romantic. Only problem is, I’ve never felt better, and we both know, you really can’t ignore me. Can you?

Joker: So, listen, Batman. I’m putting on a little show for you. It’s going to be a doozy. A real red carpet affair. You’d better hurry though, if you take too long, the leading lady may be found dead in her dressing room. (nasty laughs)

Command Center: All air units report in. Cease attack and return to base immediately. Repeat, return to base immediately.

[Batman now needs to eliminate a large number of snipers on the way to the cinema. One mistake may cost him his life.]

Joker: This is the big opening night, Batman. What’s keeping you? Get your cute little ass to the movie theatre, NOW!

Joker: Well, this is just rude. Batman! I’ve laid on all this entertainment at the movie theatre and you can even be bothered turning up. Where are you, Batman? I’ve got your premiere ticket right here in my pocket. It’s right here next to the gaffer tape and the pliers. Your leading lady’s waiting, Batman! I’ll see you soon. BYEEEE! Why are you taking so long, Batman? Oh, hold on. I get it. You want me to off this annoying woman, right? I mean, she does go on a bit with all that I am the great blah, blah, mystical mumbo jumbo. I tell you what. I’ll do it. But you owe me, OK?

[Before the final battle, Batman visits the very place where his parents were killed. Next to the flowers is a record.]

Hugo Strange: (pre-recorded) How does it feel, Wayne? To stand on the very stones that ran with your parents’ blood. Do you feel sad? Full of rage? Or does that outfit help bury your feelings. Hiding your true self. Oh, you are a truly extraordinary specimen. I look forward to breaking you.

Joker: Where are you, Batman?

Inmate: Lookout! It’s the Bat!

Joker: Helloooo! Batman! You can hear me, right? It’s just, you don’t seem to be coming to the movie theatre and I’d hate for you to read the spoilers on the Internet again.

MOVIE THEATER
[Batman enters the cinema. The Joker holds Talia at the sight of his pistol.]

Joker: Hurry up and take your seat, Batman. The show’s about to begin.

Batman: Let’s just talk about this.

Joker: (laughs) Now you want to talk? Too late, Batman! Give me the cure!

Batman: But you’ve already got the cure.

[Tired of this farce, Talia breaks Joker’s arm and pierces him with his sword.]

Batman: Talia, NO!

Talia al Ghūl: Problem solved.

Batman: You didn’t need to…

Talia al Ghūl: Why? You would never do it. You left me no choice.

Batman: There’s always a choice.

Talia al Ghūl: I had to save you. Harley Quinn stole it for him. I took it back.
It’s over.

[Batman recalls all his recent meetings with the Joker.]

Joker: Surprise!

Harley Quinn: Oh, Mister J, you look perfect.

Joker: Ring, ring. So how do you keep a secret from the world’s greatest detective, well do you know? You stick right in front of him, right under his long, pointy nose… and wait.

Thug: Yeah Joker wants you to think he’s sick then wham! Got you.

[Then suddenly a voice is heard.]

Joker: You fell for the old fake Joker gag, Batman!

[He shoots Talia in the back.]

Batman: Talia!

Talia al Ghūl: I’m sorry, beloved. I didn’t know…

Joker: Encore! More! Bravo! (coughs)

Batman: It was never you!

Joker: Not always. Well, sometimes. Confusing, isn’t it? I know I’d want to know just what the hell is going on if I were you. Let’s just say, at times like these it’s important to keep up appearances. (coughs) But first, If you would be so kind. (points his gun at him) Hand. Over. My. Cure.

[Meanwhile, the dead Joker takes the cure and starts to transform.]

Joker: Ladies and gentlemen. For one night only, standing in for yours truly, and doing a damn fine job of it, I give you… CLAYFACE!

Batman: You weren’t even supposed to be in here, Karlo. Why sign up with Joker?

Clayface: Easy… The role of a lifetime!

Batman: One.. last… chance!

[The battle begins with a huge clay monster against the background of the black and white film "The Terror".]

Joker: Oh, lighten up, Bats. The final act’s just starting and it’s a doozy! You’re supposed to be killing Batman, remember? That’s cheating! What the hell are you doing, Bats? Don’t just stand around! What are you doing? You’re making me late for my spa treatment. I mean, it’s not like you’ve got a girl to save anymore, is it? Oh, I’m sorry. Too soon? Would a change of scenery help ease the pain?

[He blows up the floor and Batman falls down a few floors. Next to him falls the same saber. Clayface turns into a lot of small clay monsters and Batman has to fight back with his sword. Having defeated the monster, he takes the cure and drinks half of the tube.]

Joker: Get out of my way, Bats! I’ve got a date with immortality.

[Batman throws the sword into the control panel near Joker. Joker trips and falls down. Giant cistern fell on Clayface smashing him and struck him with a large dose of electricity.]

Joker: Quick, the cure! What are you waiting for. C’mon! I killed your girlfriend, poisoned Gotham and hell… It’s not even breakfast. But so what? We all know you’ll save me.

Batman: Every decision you’ve ever made ends with death and misery. People die. I stop you. You’ll just break out and do it again.

Joker: Think of it as a running gag…

[The Joker attacks Batman with a knife and Batman drops the tube. It breaks.]

Joker: No! Are you happy now?

Batman: Do you want to know something funny? Even after everything you’ve done, I would have saved you.

Joker: That actually is… pretty funny…

[He begins to cough heavily, grab air with his mouth and dies. Batman takes the body of the dead Joker out of the cinema. Arkham is surrounded by police.]

Gordon: All units, coordinate your… What the? What the hell happened in there? Batman? What happened?

[Without saying a word, he just leaves.]

[Then, against a black screen background, the Joker sings a famous song Only You by The Platters. At this point the original game ends. We are teleporting to Catwoman who returns to her home.]

Catwoman: Time to get my things and quit this damn town for good. Home sweet home.

When she climbs into her window it suddenly explosives. Catwoman’s thrown a few meters away.

Inmate: Is she dead?

Inmate: Hang on! She’s wakin’ up!

Inmate: Damn it! What are we gonna do?

Inmate: Kill her again!

[Resurrected Catwoman punishes her failed killers.]

Catwoman: Where are my things? Tell me, or I’ll slice you apart, piece by piece.

Inmate: Two-Face has got ’em! He’s at the museum. OK?

Catwoman: Thanks. So you decided to come crawling back then, Harv. Pity. Oh, well. Time for this kitten to teach you some manners once and for all.

Inmate: Least they could do is send in a couple burgers.

Inmate: Joker’s just playin’ Batman. He’s not dead. He can’t be. Not Joker.

Inmate: What the?

Inmate: Is anyone ever gonna feed us?

Inmate: Joker’s not dead. No way.

Inmate: That’s it! I’m sick of standing out here. I’m gonna crack open the crate and drink the TITAN myself.

The Cat in the Museum
Inmate: Catwoman’s here!

Inmate: What was that?

Inmate: It’s the Cat! She’s here!

Inmate: Where’d she go? Anyone see her? Oh, man, she’s gone. She’s freakin’ disappeared!

Inmate: Good to see the boss back, right?

Inmate: Yeah. Did you see all that gear he had with him? Must have been from the Cat.

Inmate: What’s Catwoman doing here?

[Catwoman comes to the stand with the Penguin.]

Catwoman: What the hell are you supposed to be?

Penguin: Piss off!

Catwoman: Really? OK, if you insist. Oh, I forgot to say. Speak to me like that again, Penguin, and I’ll show you just what it feels like for a poor little bird to be tom apart by a cat.

Penguin: Please, don’t hurt me! I didn’t mean it.

Catwoman: That’s much nicer. See, you can be nice, Oswald. See you around.

Inmate: He looked pretty pleased with himself, didn’t he?

Inmate: Yeah. Don’t think I’ve ever seen the boss so happy.

Inmate: Catwoman!

Inmate: How deep do you think it is?

Inmate: Deep enough to hold one big-ass shark.

Inmate: Still can’t believe Penguin’s got a shark in here.

Inmate: That’s nothing. He also had some kind of monster under the Iceberg Lounge.

Inmate: Monster?

Inmate: Yeah. Some giant dead-lookin’ thing.

Inmate: That is bull.

Inmate: It’s all true. Jimmy saw it.

Inmate: Now I know you’re making this crap up. Jimmy’s a liar.

Inmate: Well, I believe him. He used to roll with Cobblepot before switching sides and joining up with Two-Face. He said he saw it.

Inmate: And where’s Jimmy now?

Inmate: The shark ate ’im.

Inmate: How convenient. Next time you feel like wasting my time, telling me about some fantasy crap, make sure the only guy who can back you isn’t dead, OK?

Inmate: It’s Catwoman!

[Having defeated another group of thugs, Catwoman enters the Armory. The voice of Two-Face can be heard from afar.]

Two-Face (normal side): She won’t dare come back here.

Two-Face (damaged side): Oh, she’ll dare. She’ll come straight back here for her pretty little things, and when she does, I want you guys to blow that bitch apart!

Inmate: I’m looking forward to it, sir.

Two-Face (damaged side): Good! This is our chance for glory! Word is Joker’s dead and we all saw what happened to the runt that used to run this place! We are the future of Arkham! We are the future of Gotham! No one will dare stand up to us. Because if they do, we’ll cut them in two! She’s coming, I know her too well. We both want her dead. The first one who finds her gets to be my right hand guy.

Inmate: What was that?

Two-Face (damaged side): Find her! Don’t let her get to us! Find her and skin that cat-bitch!

Inmate: Huh?

Two-Face (damaged side): What are you waiting for!

Inmate: I lost her!

Inmate: Find her NOW!

Inmate: What?

Two-Face (damaged side): Kill her! Now!

Inmate: Huh?

Two-Face (damaged side): We’ll kill you for this!

Inmate: We’ll never find her like this. Take a minute, chill the hell out, and get looking for her.

Two-Face (damaged side): I told you she’d be here! Kill her! kill her! The bitch! We need to stop her. Find the bitch. Don’t let her get away again.

Inmate: I’ve got someone here!

Inmate: What?

Two-Face (damaged side): Rip that bitch a new one!

Inmate: Anyone know what happened to this wall? It’s freakin’ gone.

Inmate: Got another one down over here.

Two-Face (damaged side): She’s here! I told you she’d come! Get her! What are you waiting for? Help me!

Inmate: You’re dead now, bitch! She’s over here!

Two-Face (damaged side): Stop her!

Inmate: New plan. We search the room for the bitch. Look everywhere. We’ll find her and when we do, she’s dead.

Two-Face (damaged side): I told you she’d be here! Kill her! kill her!

[Catwoman defeats a whole crowd of heavily armed thugs and attacks Two-Face from behind.]

Two-Face (damaged side): No!

Catwoman: Sorry, Harv. This really isn’t your night, is it? Now, tell me where you’ve hidden the rest of my stuff, or I’ll even out the other side of your face.

Two-Face (damaged side): I only took half. The rest I gave away. I win, bitch.

Catwoman: Enough with the two’s already. It just keeps getting you into trouble.

[She leaves the museum and meets Batman on a nearby roof.]

Catwoman: Just couldn’t keep away, huh? Can’t say I blame you.

Batman: There’s still work to do here in Arkham City.

Catwoman: Good luck with that. Some enterprising individuals decided to help themselves to my things. I intend to get it all back.

THE END
