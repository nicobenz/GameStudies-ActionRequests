Bull’s Eye
"Young Nate Harlow built a cabin a ways away from Bear Mountain, partly to get some distance from the Red Wolf tribe after some folks weren’t happy about him marrying Falling Star."

[A quiet evening. Nate Harlow returns to his farm with a travel bag. When his wife sees him, she drops the washtub she was carrying and runs to him. His son also runs to him.]

Nate Harlow: Darlin!

Son: Pa!

[They’re hugging.]

Nate Harlow: Son! Our troubles are finally over! We hit a vein of gold as wide as a locomotive that runs clean through Bear Mountain!

[The son notices a new gun in his father’s holster.]

Son: Hey Pa, where did you get that? 

Nate Harlow: Isn’t she a beaut? 

Son: Yeah! Can I hold it? 

Nate Harlow: She’s one of a pair. Only 2 in the whole world.

Son: Where’s the other one?

Nate Harlow: My partner Griff has it. We made them up special to symbolize our new found wealth! 

Son: Can I try it out? 

Nate Harlow: One day this fine weapon will be yours. But for now why don’t you take my old pistol.

[He pulls another gun from the second holster and holds it out to his son.]

Nate Harlow: Go on down to the river and practice while I give your Ma her gifts.

[The son runs to the river and his father and mother go into the house.]

{There’s a target practice area for you to try out your Pa’s pistol. Follow the fenced path down to the creek bed to learn how to shoot.}

[The son is practicing his shooting skills by shooting at pots. Soon his mother yells at him.]

Falling Star: Red! Red Harlow! What are you doing to my pots and pans! 

Nate Harlow: Ha Ha. Now don’t henpeck the boy. Next trip into town, I’ll buy you a whole bunch of new pots and pans.

[The farm is attacked by several bandits, shooting into the air.]

Nate Harlow: Red! Up the hill and quick, boy! We’re getting raided! 

Red Harlow: I’m coming Pa!

[He runs into the house.]

Bandit: The kid’s down by the river! Go get ‘im!

[Several bandits get in the way of the guy. He has to defend himself.]

Bandit: Dang it! He’s still alive!

[Red kills 3 bandits.]

Nate Harlow: Come on, Red! It’s now or never!

[Together with his father, they fight with the rest of the bandits, but the forces are unequal… The bandits kill Nate.]

Nate Harlow: No! 

Falling Star: Don’t! 

Red Harlow: Pa! Pa! Get up, pa! Pa! Pa! Get up, pa! Pa! Pa! 

Bandit Leader: Kid, I reckon your pa’s better off dead, him being such a yellow-belly and all. 

[The bandits laugh. In a rage, Red grabs their fire-hot father’s gun and shoots the Bandit Leader’s arm off. Taking advantage of the confusion, Red runs away and hides. His burned arm is bleeding, but he endures the pain.]

Bounty Hunter
"Little outposts like this crop up all over the West, to the disadvantage of many honest travelers."

[Years go by. A grown-up Red walks across the prairie with his dog. He clutches his right hand - it’s still hurt from that memorable night. Suddenly, a man with a bushy beard comes out from under the cart. Red quickly pulls his revolver from its holster.]

Old Man: PSST! Whoa! Easy there, uh, friend! Come over here. Come on now. It’s too dangerous for a man to be walking around in these parts! I deal in weapons and goods. See?

[The old man’s selection of stuff for sale is not extensive. While Red is exploring the merchandise, two men approach them.]

Old Man: I would offer you more, hehehe but a gang of ruffians done run me offa my, oh uh, well I didn’t uh…

Bandit 1: You holding out on us, old man? 

Old Man: No!

[He grabs the old man by the throat and throws him to the ground.]

Bandit 2: What the hell you looking at? 

Bandit 1: Fill him full of lead!

[Red kills the stinky bastards, but he is immediately surrounded by friends of the deceased.]

Old Man: Use my wagon for cover!

[Red learns how to properly use a rifle. When only one opponent remains, Red engages him in a real cowboy duel and learns to take aim in the blink of an eye with his special ability!]

{Time to learn the art of the "Deadeye"!}

[With a quick jerk of the hammer, Red puts five bullets into the bandit.]

{Congratulations, you’ve learned to use deadeye!}

[The doors of the neighboring houses open. Looks like our dead bandits had a lot more friends!]

“Bloody” Tom: I’m going to make mincemeat out of you!

[Using "Deadeye" Red quickly deals with them.]

Old Man: Damn, son! You done killed them all! You know you can get quite a handsome bounty for these fellas, if you took them down to Sheriff O’Grady in Widow’s Patch. 

Red Harlow: I’ll be taking your cart. 

Old Man: Uh, well uh, sure, whatever you say, bounty hunter. 

Ugly Streetfight
"This little town has fallen on hard times and is on it's last legs. The only thing keeping the town alive is the O'Gradys."

[Red brings the corpses of the bandits to Widow’s Patch on the old man’s wagon.]

Red Harlow: How much for the lot?

Sheriff O’Grady: Well you did good, son, but you’re out of luck. Take a look around, there ain’t much here. I got nothing to offer you. The Ugly Gang has done destroyed my town!

[Some bandits approach them.]

Bandit 1: Look at that mangy mutt! 

Bandit 2: That damn dog’s gone and relieved himself all over them fancy boots of yours! 

Bandit 1: Damn varmint!

[He kills the dog. Red is enraged and draws his gun. The sheriff hides behind the cart.]

Bandit: Take cover!

Bandit: Lay low!

Hedgehog: Die, boy, die!

Bandit: Help!

[Red kills an entire gang in the square. After that, the best sharpshooter comes out of the saloon.]

{Ok, time to learn how to duel. Let’s go over the 4 phases.}

Grab: press Back on the right analog stick. 
Draw: press Forward on the right analog stick. 
Acquiring Locks: after drawing, the slow motion targeting phase begins. Use the right analog stick to move your cursor over the enemy. The reticle will cycle between the following shot types 
Poor Shot (yellow) 
Hit (dark red) 
Critical Hit (bright red)
Press the R1 button to acquire each lock. You can have a maximum of 6 locks.
Firing: Red will fire once 6 locks have been laced or the slow motion phase times out. End the slow motion phase early press the R2 button. Ok, let’s give the whole dueling sequence a try.

[Red kills the bandit and then another important man in the gang comes out of the brothel.]

Gigolo: I’m looking at a dead man.

[Red quickly kills him with a shot to the head.]

Ugly Chris: Where you running off to sheriff?! You might we beaten my gang, but you ain’t gonna get by me!

[The leader of the gang takes the sheriff hostage. He tries to kill Red under cover of him, but he shoots him in the arm, after which the sheriff knocks him out with a few punches to the face. However, such a strain for an elderly man does not pass without a trace. The sheriff falls to the ground and starts coughing.]

Sheriff’s Daughter: Excuse me, mister! Mister, please! Can you help me? You got to help my pa! There’s no doctor left in this town!

Sheriff O’Grady: The closest doctor is in Brimstone. Sheriff Bartlett might offer you a handsome reward if you can get me there.

Sheriff’s Daughter: I’ll send a telegram and tell them about your arrival.

The Traincar
"Travel by train is about as good as it gets out on the Frontier. The company's not bad eather, usially."

[Red boards the train with the wounded sheriff.]

Sheriff O’Grady: (muffled groan) It’s a long ride to Brimstone, but I reckon I’ll manage.

[Red decides to talk to the other passengers.]

Rich Man: The best general store in the territory’s in Brimstone. I should know, I own it!

Old Woman: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

Lady: Mister, you could really use a hot bath and some fresh clothes.

Moustached Man: Howdy gunslinger, you’ll see plenty more of your kind in Brimstone.

Fat Guy: Hey mister you heading to Brimstone, too? I reckon that’s where everyone is heading. Always jobs in Brimstone. Me, I’m going to work for Carnaby Peabody, he’s manager of the Brimstone bank and a real swell guy!

[Lastly Red decides to talk to a large black man in a hat.]

Shady Guy: What you bothering me for? Sit back down!

[Red goes back to the sheriff’s house. Outside comes the clatter of hooves…]

Lady: Bandits!

Sheriff O’Grady: Well, bounty hunter, if you want this train to make it to Brimstone you better load up them guns of yours.

[At that moment, the shady guy gets up from his seat and pulls out a revolver.]

Shady Guy: Brothers, here’s a robbery. Nobody plays hero, nobody dies.

[Red engages in a duel with the shady guy. He notices that his hands are shaking - apparently he doesn’t kill often. Red quickly kills him and leaves the car to fight the rest of the bandits.]

Lady: (screams) Why is the train speeding up? Something must have happened to the engineer! (screams)

Railroaded
"Much has been written about the Pan-Atlantic Railroad being the greatest feat of engineering in the 19th century."

[Red walks on top of the wagons, killing bandits and dodging various obstacles. He reaches the main car and kills the bandit holding the engineer hostage. The engineer tries to pull the brake handle.]

Engineer: This train is going to fly off the tracks! I got to slow it down! Whew! That was close. Hey, thanks for saving me. Here, let me patch you up a bit.

[The train is attacked again.]

Engineer: There’s no end of this desperados!

[Red has to hold out for a few minutes until the train arrives at the station.]

Bandit: Die, boy, die!

Engineer: Next stop, Brimstone.

[The train arrives at the station.]

Station Clerk: The Pan-Atlantic Railroad Western Express is now arriving at Brimstone station from Widow’s Patch and points east!

Brimstone
"Gold turned this town from a back-water to the capital of the entire territory in the blink on an eye. There's plenty of places to spend your money, from the Gun Shop to the Saloon."

[Red helps the sheriff out of the station. A man with a badge approaches him.]

Sheriff: You the bounty hunter? Sheriff Bartlett. I got your telegram.

[He helps the coughing wounded sheriff.]

Sheriff Bartlett: Mighty grateful to you. I may have some work for you. Stop by my office later.

[This is Red’s first time in a major city. He decides to look around and talk to the locals first.]

Well Dressed Woman: Well I do declare, I had me such a fright the other day. One of my little ones got to drinking some liver medicine I brought from a travelling salesman…

Stocky man: Say you’re new in town ain’t you, stranger? You got to have a look around and see the sights while you’re here.

Man in Hat: There was some fancypants Englishman in town just the  other day claiming he was a famous trickshooter.

Newspaper Boy: Read all about it! The government announces the 6th annual battle royale. Offers $5000 prize to the quickest draw in the territory!

Salesmen: Hey, you look like you’ve travelled around these parts. I heard you was the one that saved Sheriff O’Grady’s life.

[Red walks into the sheriff’s office.]

Sheriff Bartlett: If you’re as good a bounty hunter as O’Grady says you are, you could help me with a couple of real outlaws wreaking havoc in my territory. It’d be worth a pretty penny to you! You might want to start with Pig Josh, he’s one crazy outlaw and circus freak. Just be careful he’s got a hankering for dynamite. Oh, you might wanna keep your eyes out for some English feller, he don’t know what a motley crew he keeping company with.

Carnival Life
"This abandoned Army outpost has been used as a stopping point for many a traveler, until Professor Perry and his cursed Carnival showed up."

[Red arms himself and goes in search of the gang. He walks into a small dusty town on the outskirts and notices a well-dressed Englishman sitting in a wooden cage.]

Englishman: Excuse me, excuse me, sir. I seem to have found myself in a most unfortunate situation. If you would be kind enough to help me.

[Red is slowly surrounded by criminals dressed as clowns.]

Red Harlow: You ain’t my problem.

Englishman: Indeed sir, however, you might feel differently once you look behind you.

[Red turns around, instinctively pulling out his revolver. He realizes he is surrounded. Firing several shots into the cage, Red frees the Englishman. A firefight ensues. The Englishman proves to be quite a marksman - deftly wielding two revolvers, he provides considerable assistance in the firefight. Red shoots the clowns off like a shooting gallery. Soon the village is deserted.]

Englishman: I’m guessing there’s more where they came from. That’s contraption should make short work of them. I’ll cover you.

[Red runs to the machine gun while several more heavily armed clowns emerge from the circus wagon. Red quickly dispatches them. Out of the wagon comes Pig Josh himself. His fat torso is wrapped in dynamite - there are even two sticks of dynamite strapped to his head.]

Pig Josh: You’re going to blow up real good, cowboy!

[Laughing and grunting, he goes at Red. Trying to stay away from the explosive fat man, Red feeds him lead from around the corner. Shortly thereafter, the fat man dies.]

Englishman: Thank you sir, your help has been immensely appreciated. If I can be of any assistance whatsoever do not hesitate to call on me. Now, if you’ll excuse me I have a certain debt to collect from Professor Perry and his circus crew. Good day to you.

Freak Show
"Once upon a time, Widow's Patch had all the right features. Nowadays, the few honest folk left, lock their doors at night."

[We switch to an Englishman to help him collect the debt. He comes to a small town under the cover of night. The town is lit only by a few torches placed around the place. He notices a woman tied to a huge barrel of water and draws his revolvers.]

Katie: You cowards! Somebody let me free!

[She notices an Englishman approaching.]

Katie: Oh, Mister, mister, please! You got to cut me loose! Mister, please!

[He signals her to be quiet and looks around. He then holsters his revolvers and approaches the woman to untie her hands, but at that moment a knife stabs into the wooden beam next to the Englishman. He instinctively turns around pulling out his revolvers. The town is filled with bandits. He deftly kills them by shooting with both hands. A lean and tall man with a torch in his hand emerges from a lodge.]

LaRouche: Who’s up for some barbeque?

[He sets the house he was in on fire and runs to the Englishman. The Engishman kills him and several bandits who appeared with him.]

Englishman: What an extinguished fellow!

[At this point, a short man appears on the water barrel. He is armed with a bottle of green glowing liquid.]

Professor Perry: Jack! What an unpleasant surprise.

[He disappears, vanishing into the green smoke. He appears in a completely different place behind the Englishman.]

Professor Perry: That wasn’t very nice Jack. Don’t bet on making it out again.

[A real battle begins with the constantly shifting professor.]

Professor Perry: Time for a little pick me up I think. My boys will keep you busy.

[He drinks from his bottle, and in the meantime the town is overrun by bandit clowns. The professor himself is also in the fray.]

Professor Perry: All this excitement has made me quite thirsty!

[He drinks from the bottle again, regaining some of his health. The Englishman has to cut it down again.]

Professor Perry: Dammit, I’ve almost run dry. Okay, Swift, I’ve had enough of you now.

[The Englishman shoots the professor standing on the roof with a well-aimed shot, and meanwhile we learn his full name - Jack Swift.]

Jack Swift: Never did like the circus.

[He unties Katie’s hands, who falls into his arms. The townspeople return to the city.]

Katie: That was incredible. You saved my life!

Jack Swift: All in a day’s work. I only wish it were more financially gratifying.

[Katie is terribly upset by his answer. She puts her hand on her hip and changes the tone of her voice.]

Katie: Well shoot, Mister, if getting yourself a little money is all you’re worried about tnen, I know where someone with your talent could pick up five thousand dollars in gold without even trying!

Jack Swift: Pray do tell, young lady, and I will be forever in your debt!

Katie: There’s a sharpshooter competition in Brimstone, winner takes all. Shouldn’t be a problem for such a fine marksmen like yourself.

[Stunned by the girl’s romantic pressure, Jack decides to bow out.]

Jack Swift: Well, madam.

[Morning. We return to Red, who gets the latest news from the Newspaper Boy.]

NewsNewspaper Boy: Professor Perry perishes at the hands of a travelling showman!

Lady: Good day to you, sir! I don’t suppose you now what’s going on up Rogue Valley would you?

[Red goes to the sheriff’s office. He sits in a chair with his feet up on the table.]

Sheriff Bartlett: Not bad bounty hunter. Not bad at all. Now I reckon you could really line your pockets, if you don’t mind hunting down a woman.

[He points to a poster hanging on the wall. It shows a lady named Bad Bessie.]

Sheriff Bartlett: If you can call her a woman.

[Without saying a word, Red agrees to find her. He walks out of the sheriff’s office and arms himself.]

Rogue Valley
"It was hard enough getting to Clemenine Falls through Rogue Valley even before it turned into a hideout for murderers."

[Red finds Bassie’s gang in the mountains. He climbs the rocks and kills the bandits one by one with his rifle. In addition to the bandits, he is also confronted by Indian archers, and some particularly tough bandits throw rocks at him. At the ruined bridge, Red is confronted by two tough bandits. Red draws his revolver and kills them both with well-aimed shots to the head. As he walks on, he meets an old acquaintance.]

Old Man: Hey, friend. Follow me, I know a short cut. Friend! You go ahead, I’ll follow you!

[The old man shows him the way through the cave. Red goes out to a hut near a suspension bridge, where he is ambushed by several armed bandits and an Indian archer from behind some rocks.]

Bad Bessie: I could hear you coming, little man. You think you can handle taking on a woman like me? You either drunk or crazy.

[She spits on the sand. Her underlings open fire. Red kills them one by one. Bassey, armed with a whip, doesn’t give up so easily.]

Bad Bessie: This is the fight you can’t win, bounty hunter! I’ll teach you how to mess with Bessie! 

[Red, however, kills her with a shotgun. He picks up her corpse and puts it on his shoulder.]

Red Harlow: Hate to kill a lady.

[He leaves Rogue Valley with her body, and returns to the city.]

Newspaper Boy: Bad Bessie was beaten by a brave bounty hunter! Rogue Valley to be renamed after Bounty Hunter clears out bandits!

[Red goes to the sheriff.]

Sheriff Bartlett: Hahahahaha, I reckon that old Bessie was a real handful. Take care of this last one and I will make it worth your while. Mr. Black, he’s a strange one. Truth be told, I ain’t even sure if he’s alive, but he’s hurt a lot of good folk in this town and he needs taking care of.

[Without a word, Red leaves the sheriff’s office.]

Ghost Town
"Tarnation was the odd child of the territory. The town fell apart after most of the citizens left, except that strange undertaker, Mr. N. Black."

[He arrives at an abandoned town consisting of a single through street, flanked by dilapidated houses. The wind sways a worn sign on one of the buildings, and there are bandits hiding inside. Red, realizing it’s an ambush, pulls out his revolver. He runs down the long street, shooting the bandits accurately and killing them with a single shot. At the end of the street more serious opponents await him. A man in a purple suit and two of his underlings come out to meet him.]

Man In Purple Suit: Your judgment day has come.

[Red pulls his revolver from its holster and kills all three of them. He then climbs the mountain and where the cemetery is located.]

The Cemetery
"Many brave gunfighters and cowardly murderers are buried in the Tarnation Cemetery. Mr Black welcomes them all equally."

[In a creepy abandoned cemetery, several bandits are hiding, ready to fight. Along with them walks a skinny gentleman with a coffin behind his back. This is Mr. Black.]

Mr. Black: Hahahahahahaha!

[The bandits, along with their leader, slowly approach Red. The exit from the cemetery is closed, so he has no choice but to fight. Red quickly kills the bandits, but defeating Mr. Black is not so easy. Hidden in his coffin is a machine gun, which he does not hesitate to use. Red hides behind tombstones. Catching the moment, he shoots the creepy guy right in the head and kills him. He falls down and ends up in his own coffin. Red walks up to him and kicks the lid shut, then returns to town.]

Newspaper Boy: Bounty claimed for the most wanted head in the territory! Sheriff Bartlett says we’re safer than ever!

[Red goes to the sheriff’s office.]

Sheriff Bartlett: You’re one hell of a bounty hunter, Mister. You’d make me one fine deputy.

Red Harlow: I just want my money.

[The sheriff gives Red a bank receipt.]

Sheriff Bartlett: From what I hear the wagon hasn’t arrived with the bank’s gold. You’ll have to take that up with Mr. Peabody, the bank manager.

[Red goes to the bank.]

Woman: I just need one more week! I can pay you the $5,000 that I owe, but the Governor is bribing my ranch hands to leave, I can’t do it by myself.

Manager: Well, why don’t you just sell up to the Governor. You could always move into town and work in the saloon.

Woman: The Saloon! How dare you! I just need one more week!

Manager: I don’t think the owner of the bank would approve.

Woman: Well maybe I can speak with him myself.

Manager: I’m sorry, but the governor is too busy for the likes of you.

Woman: (angerly) To hell with that evil son of a bitch! He’s mined enough gold out of Bear Mountain! What the hell does he want with my damn ranch!

[She leaves the bank and runs into Red on the way out.]

Red Harlow: Ma’am?

Manager: I’m sorry, sir. How may I be of assistance?

Red Harlow: I want my money!

[He gives the manager the receipt the sheriff gave him.]

Manager: We have a small problem.

Red Harlow: Then tell me about the gold in Bear Mountain that young lady was talking about.

Manager: I’m sorry I can’t disclose anything about our clients.

[Grabs the manager by his jacket and lifts him out of his chair.]

Red Harlow: Then tell me where she lives. And when I get back, you better have my gold!

Range War
"When Annie's father passed on, he left her a fine stretch of land near Bear Mountain, along with enough money to build a ranch and fulfill her dream."

[We switch to the woman from the bank and find out her name is Annie Stoakes. She returns to her ranch and sees a note nailed to the entrance.]

Annie Stoakes: Sorry, Annie, but the Governor made us a better offer. Good luck. --SAM. God not you, too, Sam!

[She notices that the house on her property is on fire and runs to it. It looks like they tried to burn it down earlier and the arsonists are still on the ranch. Annie pulls out a rifle.]

Annie Stoakes: Hold on, Bessie! I ain’t gonna let you roast!

[After killing all the arsonists, she goes to the barn to take her cows out. After that she is attacked by several bandits who try to kill Annie from afar with rifles, but she is a better marksman. Next, the gang leaders Buff and Holsten decide to attack the ranch. They ride in on bison which break everything around them. Dexterous Annie doesn’t let herself be grabbed by a lasso and kills the jerks. Red enters the ranch tinkling his spurs. Annie aims her rifle at him.]

Red Harlow: Ma’am.

Annie Stoakes: Do I know you, stranger?

Red Harlow: Tell me about the Gold Mine in Bear Mountain.

Annie Stoakes: I know nothing about a gold mine. You might want to take a trip on down to the saloon in Brimstone. It’s always littered with a bunch of drunks yapping about it. But watch yourself mister. You want no business with the folks in that town. This place is all I’ve ever known.

Red Harlow: Ma’am.

[He gives her the receipt from the sheriff and leaves.]

Annie Stoakes: Five thousand pieces in gold. This’ll help me keep my ranch!

Saloon Fight
"Everybody ends up in the Brimstone Saloon. With all the gold coming through, it seems like the drinks never stop flowing."

[Red walks into the bar that Annie told him about. The bar patrons are drinking and partying noisily. Red orders himself a glass of booze and overhears the conversation.]

Man 1: All I’m saying, is if it was me that lost an arm…

Man 2: Well maybe, but a cannon? Well that’s too much gun for any man!

Dan: Cork your whisky holes. You didn’t know him before, like I did. Only a cannon could replace that man’s arm.

Red Harlow: How did he lose his arm?

Dan: We ain’t telling you nothing stranger! Near as I can tell, we ain’t even talking to you! Take a walk!

[The bandits laugh merrily at the mocking manner in which he uttered the phrase. Red grabs Dan from behind.]

Red Harlow: Answer my question and I’ll be on my way.

Man 1: Well shut up! Don’t tell this stinking prairie dog nothing!

[Panic ensues in the bar.]

Man 2: Ain’t that right, Sam?

[A menacing-looking bearded man comes out to them.]

Sam: I reckon so… Say goodbye, Mister.

[Someone hits Red over the head, taking his revolver! A bloody scuffle ensues. Red tries to protect the prostitutes in the bar, preventing the bandits from harming them. He uses the neck of a bottle and stabs the bandits with it, as well as using his fists and feet. Tactically using his surroundings he manages to defeat many bandits and save the girls. After the scuffle, a girl bartender emerges from behind the bar.]

Barkeeper: You’re pretty good in a fight, stranger. The only problem is you lost your guns in all the ruckus.

[She holds out her revolver to him.]

Barkeeper: Here you go. Looks like you still got some business with them brothers. They ain’t what you call kindly fellows.

Red Harlow: Open the damn door, woman!

Barkeeper: Well, good luck to you, but I got to look out for myself, so this door is getting locked behind you.

[Red enters the next room to the stage where the bandits are seated. They are merrily discussing something, unaware of what awaits them. Red walks toward them through a puff of smoke.]

Dan: Well look at what we got here!

[The three bandits disperse in preparation for a firefight.]

Dan: If there’s anything I can’t stand, it’s a varmint what don’t know it’s own business.

[Red kills them by quickly pulling his revolver from the holster. A gunfight ensues! Red kills all the bandits in the theater and then the backstage area rises. Two girls in red dresses dance the can-can and suddenly pull out their rifles. Also from behind the barrels on the second floor, many bandits appear, as well as an escaped tough, bearded bandit named Sam.]

Sam: Now the real show begins!

[The situation is very serious and dangerous. Red quickly runs towards the stage killing the girls with well-aimed shots and hides behind it. He kills all the bandits on the second floor, after which Sam comes down to him. The big guy easily withstands the shots and attacks Red from a running start, but it is his strong build that makes him extremely clumsy, which Red takes advantage of to kill him. After the victory the sheriff suddenly approaches from behind with a revolver in his hands.]

Sheriff Bartlett: Alright, there bounty hunter. That’s enough disturbing the peace for one day. Hand over the weapon.

[Red walks toward him without a word, stone-faced. The sheriff steps back in fear.]

Sheriff Bartlett: I said, hand it over!

[Red holds out his revolver to him. They return to town and the sheriff puts Red in jail.]

Sheriff Bartlett: Fellow such as yourself should know better than to stick his nose where it don’t belong.

Red Harlow: Tell me about the one-armed man.

Sheriff Bartlett: Hahahaha! What’s it to you?

Red Harlow: He killed my folks!

Sheriff Bartlett: Well, I’ll be darned. I heard rumors you were alive but never believed it. You’re Nate Harlow’s son, Red!

Red Harlow: Tell me what you know about the death of my family.

Sheriff Bartlett: You see, it all happened about 12 years ago, when the U.S. cavalry made a little incursion south of the border.

The Traitor
"Before he became the wealthy man he is today, a remote bridge over the river was General Diego's favorite smuggling route."

[We jump back in time for 12 years.]

General Diego: Hahahaha! We have those Gringos exactly where we want them!

Commander: Generalissimo, you’re not planning to take on the entire Yankee army?

[The General menacingly approaches him.]

General Diego: You don’t expect me to answer a stupid question like that? Prepare the artillery!

[The General is personally involved in taking over the territory. He shoots off attacking Northern troops with his mighty rifle, and assists the soldiers.]

{You need to weaken the US cannon artillery. Command your battalion to fire by using your Flare Rifle. Draw your rifle and press the R2 button to load a flare. Your army’s cannons will fire at the flare location. Now, attack the US cannons!}

[The General uses his rifle to mark the cannons that must be destroyed. He manages to reduce the number of cannons of the North, but can not keep the victory.]

General Diego: There are too many of them. The bridge must be destroyed. Set the charges where you must.

Commander: But general that would be suicide.

General Diego: It certainly will be if you don’t. Ándale! Ándale!

[The General helps contain the enemy while the charges are set. Soon his soldiers blow up the bridge.]

General Diego: Ándale! Ándale! This will teach those gringos to cross the Rio Grande!

[General Diego’s soldiers catch some poor guy in a raccoon hat.]

Colonel Daren: No uniform, he must be a spy. Bring him to me!

[The man is taken to General Diego and brought to his knees.]

General Diego: Take him to the river and shoot him like a dog!

Man: No, no, no! I’m not a spy, I’m a businessman. Please! I was just trying to get across the river. Please, I have gold. Lots of gold!

General Diego: Ha ha. You lie to save your pathetic life.

[The man is led to the river.]

Man: No! It’s true! It’s true! I have gold!

General Diego: Bring him to me!

Man: It’s lots of gold, more gold than you’ve ever seen. A gold mine, and it’s just over the border in the territory! If you spare my life, I can give you half.

General Diego: Why shouldn’t I take all of it?

Man: Cause you don’t know where it is.

General Diego: You better speak fast. We need some privacy…

[The commander signals to the other soldiers to leave.]

General Diego: …now tell me more about this gold mine.

Man: Truth be told, there is one little problem. I only own half the claim. My partner Nate owns the other half.

[The man turns out to be a friend of Red’s father, Griff!]

General Diego: And what if I kill your partner?

Griff: Then that would make us… partners.

[General Diego shakes Griff’s hand.]

General Diego: Partner! Hahahahaha!

[The sheriff’s story ends and we head back to the office.]

Red Harlow: Where would I find this Diego?

Sheriff Bartlett: He rides through the territory to deliver gold to the Governor once a week. He rests his horses at Devil’s Fork. It won’t be easy. That wagon is like a fortress on wheels.

[He opens the cell and lets Red out.]

Sheriff Bartlett: The charges are dropped, if you reckon you can
bring him in, dead or… well dead’ll do.

[The sheriff gives Red back his weapons.]

Red Harlow: Much obliged.

[He leaves the sheriff’s office.]

Sunset Canyon
"The ruins of Mission San Meland dominate Sunset Canyon, which leads to the sacred places on the slopes of Bear Mountain."

[Red climbs the rocks to get to Devil’s Fork unnoticed. After killing some bandit guards, he climbs the mountain where the half-destroyed church is located. He mounts a horse.]

Commander: We’re being raided!

[The frightened commander gets on the wagon and tries to drive away. Red rushes after him, shooting at the wheels. He manages to destroy the wagon, but Colonel Daren knocks him out with a blow from his metal prosthetic. Diego approaches him.]

General Diego: I want him alive. I have questions for this one… Take him to the Gold Mine!

[Two of the general’s soldiers drag Red away.]

Bear Mountain
"Bear Mountain was the original homeland of the Red Wolf tribe. The bones of the tribe's ancestors rest in the sacred woods on the northen slopes of the mountain."

[We switch to a new character, an Indian named Shadow Wolf. He kneels before the elders of his tribe.]

Shadow Wolf: My fathers, I have news.

Standing Snake: What is it, Shadow Wolf?

Shadow Wolf: Cousin Red is alive! I saw the devil Diego take him prisoner to the mines.

Standing Snake: You must help him then. Go, Shadow Wolf, but beware of the ghost devil.

[Shadow Wolf walks cautiously along the mouth of the river, quietly killing General Diego’s soldiers with his bow.]

Soldier: I wonder what General Diego’s doing right now…

Soldier: I heard something!

Soldier: Sure it’s cold down here!

Soldier: A lot colder than the grave, which you will be if you don’t keep quiet! 

Soldier: At least we don’t have Coronel Daren watching us!

Soldier: Zzzzz…

Soldier: (farts) Anymore of those beans left?

Soldier: Si, but they’re cold!

Soldier: Like everything up here!

Soldier: What time is it?

Soldier: Must be close to midnight.

Soldier: Should we wake him yet?

Soldier: No, he just yelled at us more.

Soldier: At least it’s quiet…

Soldier: What was that?

Soldier: Is someone there?

Soldier: Who’s there? 

[Walking along the mouth of the river Shadow Wolf emerges into a large clearing with bridges set up on high stones. A stout man dressed in bear skin jumps out at him from behind a waterfall. He growls menacingly and attacks. It is the ghost of the devil, Grizzly. After a hard fight, the Indian man manages to overpower the big man. He approaches the body and cuts something off of it, then goes to a secret passage behind the waterfall.]

Jailbreak
"About the only thing worse than being stuck in jail is being stuck in jail in a mine."

[Meanwhile, in General Diego’s dungeon, Red talks to a soldier who is imprisoned with him.]

Solder Prisoner: It’s been a week since General Diego captured me. I don’t know nothing about bounty hunting, but I’ve been a slave once and ain’t gonna never do it again.

[Shadow Wolf quietly approaches the cell.]

Shadow Wolf: Cousin Red?

Red Harlow: Shadow Wolf?

[The Indian opens the door of the cage.]

Shadow Wolf: I knew I’d find you! The blood bond between us is strong.

Soldier Prisoner: I’ll go to Brimstone. I’ll have the Cavalry here in no time!

Shadow Wolf: Go fast, Soldier. Unless we separate we’ll have no chance for escape. I will go this way and meet you at Diego’s fort.

[He leaves. Now it is up to Red to walk through the caves himself and get to the mine without attracting the attention of the armed guards. He finds some knives and uses them to kill the guards unnoticed. Soon he finds the prison located in the mines and hides behind a corner eavesdropping on a conversation.]

Boss: What did I tell you about paying attention?

Guard: You said we’re gonna pay attention anytime cause something may happen anywhere at any time…

Boss: So? You let the prisoner unguarded?

Guard: Well… I was paying attention, boss. I got into thinking… if anything could happen at any time anywhere then something might happen someplace else that I wasn’t paying attention to. So I’m nosing around the corner…

Boss: But I told you to guard the prisoners!

Guard: But you said anything could happen at any time, boss! So I got to thinking over it…

Boss: You ain’t pay to think!

Guard: Okay! But I thought you said anything could…

Boss: What are you doing?

Guard: I don’t know, boss.

Boss: You’re thinking!

Guard: Is that what I’m doing?

Boss: I told you not to think, didn’t I?

Guard: You told me to pay attention, and I figure paying attention is the good part of thinking.

Boss: No it don’t! It means standing there with your eye holes and ear holes open, darling!

Guard: Well, it’s hard to shut down your brain like that boss.

Boss: It shouldn’t been too hard for you!

Guard: But… how you’re standing there right? With your eyes and ears open and you’re not thinking? Just about anybody could just sneak up on you because you wouldn’t think to yourself, "Hey, there are some fool trying to slip on past me there."

Boss: Because you don’t started thinking your eyes and ears with marching around that corner and they stuck on passer anyway!

Guard: Come to think of it, it seems like either way it don’t work out, right?

Boss: You’re thinking again. That’s where you get yourself in trouble every time, dang it!

[The guard leaves and the boss replaces him. Red quietly kills them both with the knife. Realizing he needs a key to open the jail door, he searches the surroundings. He even manages to get a weapon from one of the guards. Red finds the room where the key is supposed to be. He kicks the door open as most of the guards are dead. There are three bandits in the room - Sergio, Ennio and Eli.]

Ennio: Finally. We just been killing time since Mr. Kelley made us guard this hole in the ground but it looks like things are picking up. That’s bad luck for you, stranger.

[Red pulls out his revolver and kills all three of them.]

The Mine
"They say gold makes fools of men. The Bear Mountain mine supplied enough gold for an army of fools."

[Red goes down deeper where he meets two brothers, Ted and Tony, one of whom is a pyromaniac and the other a good with a rifle. A heated battle ensues from which Red manages to come out the winner. He notices that the exit to the mine is blocked. Red puts the corpse of one of the brothers in the wagon and kicks in the door.]

Stagecoach
"Some say that wagon drivers were the true heroes of the West. They faced more dangers and saved more lives that the bravest of sheriffs. This route was one of the worst."

[We switch to a new character, Buffalo Soldier, who escaped from the mine not too long ago. The brave military man brakes a wagon on the road.]

Driver: Whoa!

Soldier: Hey there, you going to Brimstone?

Driver: Close enough, I suppose. The express road passes about a mile outside of town.

Soldier: Well, I got to get to the governor so he can call out the troops. There’s trouble heading from down South.

Driver: Well, climb on back soldier.

[The soldier climbs into the back of a cart filled with boxes of dynamite and checks his equipment. The cart begins to move. At that moment, several riders approach them.]

Driver: Looks like we’ve got company! You sure you want me to follow?

Soldier: What kind of fool drives a wagon full of TNT across the country? Up those General Gamers, man. Oh stop. I think I was safe.

[The soldier kills the approaching horsemen.]

Driver: I hope we can make it to the Canyons.

Soldier: Can’t you go any faster?

Driver: Left! Right! Left! Right!

Soldier: To watch the road I watch the riders!

Driver: Oh looks like I was wrong. Now they are coming from both sides!

Hell Pass
"Hell Pass is a place of natural beauty and wonder, and might be renamed something kinder in more peaceful times."

[They enter a canyon on top of which Indians with bows are stationed. They are firing at the cart.]

Driver: There goes our last chance.

Soldier: Just keep driving.

[After a grueling battle, the soldier and the driver manage to get out of the canyon and defeat the Indian leader, Standing Snake. The soldier climbs out of the cart.]

Driver: Brimstone is just about mile or so down that away. Sorry I can’t take you any closer, but there are some desperate folks in need of these supplies.

Soldier: Much obliged, Mister. I’ll make sure to tell the Governor you helped me. There may even be a reward in it for you.

Driver: If it’s all the same to you, I’d just as soon Governor Griffon don’t even know who I am. Good luck to you, soldier.

[He leaves, and the soldier goes to the governor to report.]

Soldier: Governor, you got to call General Boden right away, sir!

Governor Griffon: Hehe, who let you in here, Soldier?

Soldier: There’s a renegade general on your territory. His name is Diego. He’s running a gold mine and he’s using slave labor. It’s a job only the U.S. Army can handle, sir! He has an army and a fort, too!

[Three men - two of them dressed in nice suits and one wearing a wide-brimmed hat - approach the soldier.]

Governor Griffon: Well, thank you soldier. Mr. Diego is one of my biggest contributors. I’m sure this is all a simple misunderstanding. But Mr. Kelley here, he’s going to take good care of you.

[The man in the wide-brimmed hat pulls out a revolver and points it at the soldier.]

Fort Diego
"General Diego set up his base in an old fort, which had been abandoned after the war ended and before gold was discovered on nearby Bear Mountain."

[Meanwhile, Red and Shadow Wolf find themselves in a dilapidated city where a real war is raging. They hide behind the remnants of the brick walls.]

Shadow Wolf: Cousin! If we wait much longer for the cavalry they will be rescuing our corpses. If we attack that gatling gun head on we’ll both die. I’ll draw their fire while you try to find a way inside the walls.

[He leaves and Red, moving quickly through the half-destroyed city and over the remains of the buildings deftly kills the bandits with his revolver. After a few dozen dead bodies, he emerges into the center of the city, where once there was a large building and now only its debris. Colonel Daren comes out to Red. He defeats Shadow Wolf and throws him beaten to the ground.]

Corporal Daren: Revenge shall be mine!

[The battle begins. The Colonel turns out to be a pretty tough guy, in addition to which he has a small cannon attached to his back from which he fires miniature cannonballs. Red has to calculate the exact moment to attack him. After killing the colonel, Red runs up to the Indian lying on the ground. He is on his last breath and is coughing up blood.]

Shadow Wolf: Many are the dead who have prayed for this moment. You have done well Red, but his master, Diego, still lives.

[They hear the train whistle from afar.]

Shadow Wolf: That’s Diego’s war train. Go, cousin, finish what you have started. 

[The Indian dies. Red folds his arms across his chest and pulls out his knife, in which he goes to the corlonel’s body. He stabs the Indian’s knife right into the corpse’s chest.]

Red Harlow: Our people now shall know of your courage, cousin.

End of The Line
"General Diego built his own private armored train to help him move lots of heavy gold. It was the most amazing machine folks around here had ever seen."

[Meanwhile, on the train, General Diego is reprimanding his soldiers cleaning their rifles.]

General Diego: What? Did you forget how to use those rifles! I have had enough! A thousand pieces in gold to the man who brings me that gringo’s head.

[Red gallops after the train on horseback. The train is a real death machine with turrets and protected firing windows. Red hops onto the wagons and unhooks them one by one. Soon he hears the voice of an old man riding a dreck.]

Old Man: Howdy stranger! Sure is a lot of traffic on this here line today, ain’t there?

Devils and Angels
"There isn't a machine built that can stand up to a man with determination, and lots of ammo."

[Red gallops to the opposite track and jumps on the dreck. It has a machine gun attached to it, which Red immediately uses to fire on the train. He blows up the main carriage, after which the belt stops. It is time to face General Diego one-on-one. He hides in a wagon surrounded by several of his soldiers. Red kills the soldiers and throws a Molotov cocktail through the window of the iron wagon, causing Diego to leave the wagon.]

General Diego: (laughs) It is far from over, gringo!

[He pulls out his high-powered rifle and they land one-on-one. Red shoots the General and the rifle falls out of his hands. He crawls down the railroad tracks away from Red.]

General Diego: I have gold, loss of it, you can have it if you spare my life. Whiskey, women, fine weapons, anything you want. What do you say, Partner?

[Red shoots him in the head without a word.]

Battle Royale
"A contest filled with blood and bullets on the street of our fair city. It's easy to condemn it, but it's hard not to watch."

[We’re back in Brimstone, where the sheriff is holding that sixth annual gunslinger tournament. Famous duelists have come to town.]

Sheriff Bartlett: He’s killed so many men down south, he had to come up north to find some more; Senor Gabriel Navarro!

[The crowd applauds.]

Sheriff Bartlett: Challenging him is a man of mystery. Some of you may have heard of all the recent bounty hunting he did on behalf of the town. Ladies and gentlemen, Red!

[Red kills Señor Navarro with a few precise shots. After that, we see several old style photos of Annie, Jack fighting and winning as well. They, too, stand among the crowd and applaud Red’s victory.]

Jack Swift: That should leave a bruise!

Sheriff Bartlett: I don’t reckon he should be so eager to get himself killed, but rules is the rules and there’s no denying he’s quick on the draw. He can’t shave but he sure can shoot, the challenger, Kid Cougar!

[Red engages in a fight with a young guy and kills him. After that, he goes to the bar.]

Sheriff Bartlett: Red, glad to see you made it through the preliminaries, tomorrow should prove to be an exciting day.

Mr. Kelley: (laughs) I wouldn’t be too cocky, Bounty Hunter. Even a blind squirrel finds a nut from time to time.

Whore: Hey Sugar, glad to see you made it this far. I got my eye on you now, honey. You do well tomorrow and my oh my, we’ll do some celebrating together.

[Red goes to his room to sleep. The next day the contest continues.]

Battle Finale
"What goes around comes around and the folks of Brimstone have turned a blind eye for too long."

Sheriff Bartlett: For our semi-final round, we have a three time winner and current champion, the sharpest shooter and dresser in the whole territory, Mister Kelley! The brave soul challenging him is a man who’s killed a lot of bad men around here and is looking to kill some more… Red!

[A man approaches the sheriff from behind and takes him inside the building. The governor comes out on the balcony.]

Governor Griffon: Due to the sudden absence of Sheriff Bartlett, I’m going to be stepping in to oversee this uh, conclusion to the Battle Royale. Now whereas the two gentlemen before us are clear the best, I believe a change of the rules is in order. I hereby disqualify Jack Swift and Annie Stoakes. The winner of this here round is going to be the winner of the Battle Royale.

[A long-awaited duel occurs between Red and Mr. Kelly. Red kills the dandy, after which the governor points his revolver at him.]

Governor Griffon: Well Red, you’re good, I’ll give you that, but of course you’d have to be to live through what you did. Still, I’m afraid that we’re going to have to end right here and now what we should have ended so many years ago.

[Red looks at the governor’s gun and hears voices from the distant past.]

Nate Harlow: Isn’t she a beut? 

Young Red: Yeah! Can I hold it?

Nate Harlow: She’s one of a pair. Only 2 in the whole world.

Young Red: Where’s the other one?

[That’s the revolver! Mr. Kelly, meanwhile, gets up off the ground. Looks like he’s been wearing a bulletproof vest under his clothes the whole time!]

Governor Griffon: Mr. Kelley, please join me at the mansion when you’ve finally taken care of business.

[Mr. Kelly is going to kill Red. Panic erupts in the town and the people who have gathered for the tournament scatter to get in the way of the shooting. The battle with Mr. Kelly proves to be quite grueling as the man is a skilled marksman. Red has to use all of his skills to defeat him. When Red kills him he, along with Jack and Annie, approach the corpse.]

Jack Swift: Well, I guess I lost my chance at five thousand in gold. A small pride to pay to avoid shooting you, madam.

Annie Stoakes: (smiles) Jack Swift, you’re just lucky to be alive.

[She notices the sheriff coming out of the house. He is coughing heavily and holding his head.]

Annie Stoakes: Sheriff? Are you alright?

Sheriff Bartlett: I’m alright!

[Red walks up to him with a serious face and grabs the sheriff’s jacket.]

Red Harlow: Tell me where to find him.

Sheriff Bartlett: His mansion! But it’s secured like a fortress. It’ll be hard even for a Bounty Hunter like you.

[Red leaves without saying a word.]

Jack Swift: He will not be alone.

Annie Stoakes: He ain’t the only one that wants the governor. I reckon that there prize money is in that mansion of his.

[They follow Red.]

The Siege
"Everyone thought the Governor went overboard when he built a mansion fit for European royalty. Then again, there's not much for a millionaire to buy out here."

[Meanwhile, the governor in his estate instructs one of his men, Oswald.]

Governor Griffon: Anyone comes through that gate, you kill them. I don’t care if it’s your Grannie’s ghost, you put a bullet in between their eyes, and you don’t stop shooting that rifle until you ain’t got no bullets left. You understand me?

[Red, Annie, and Jack enter the garden near the mansion. The governor’s men are hiding everywhere.]

Jack Swift: Let’s see if we can find a way in that will attract a little less attention.

Annie Stoakes: I’ll go round this way.

Red Harlow: I’m going straight in.

[Red kills Oswald standing on the balcony of the manor as well as a dozen more of the governor’s men.]

Jack Swift: I think a frontal assault is out of the question. Suggestions?

Annie Stoakes: Follow me. And shoot anything that moves.

[Red and his friends continue to attack the mansion and kill the governor’s men. They go up to the second floor and try to go inside, but all the doors are closed.]

Annie Stoakes: Dammit!

Jack Swift: The only thing left in my bag tricks is to pick the damn lock on the front door. Think you two can keep me from getting shot in the back while I do it?

Annie Stoakes: Only one way to out. I’ll cover you from up here with my rifle.

Jack Swift: All right then mate, follow me!

[Red and Annie defend Jack for three minutes.]

Jack Swift: I got it! Let’s go!

[Jack, Annie, and Red enter the mansion.]

House of Cards
"The inside of the mansion is like a cross between a maze and a museum. If you don't know where you're going, you may never be seen again."

Annie Stoakes: That no good Governor is going to be sorry he burned down my ranch after I get through with this fancy house.

Jack Swift: I don’t think the Governor is going to be in a position to care about much of anything soon.

Annie Stoakes: Keep your heads down boys.

[The governor’s men attack them from every room. The heroes have to fight for every corridor. Red’s keen eye finds a small crack in the wall. He presses on the wall and opens a secret door.]

Jack Swift: Right! A secret door! That’s the stuff! Probably leads right to the bastard!

[Red goes inside. Several of the governor’s men burst in.]

Jack Swift: I’ll keep these devils at bay, you see where that passage leads.

[Red makes his way through the inner corridors of the mansion and out into the opposite part of it, killing everyone in his path. Annie runs up to him.]

Annie Stoakes: I busted up the place something good, found the keys to the whole place on one of them dead bluejackets. Still ain’t seen hide nor hair of that sneaky Governor, though. Let’s keep moving, he’s got to be around here somewhere.

[Together they continue to kill crowds of the governor’s men. In one of the storerooms they unexpectedly find the same soldier who was guarding the dynamite cart! It looks like the governor hasn’t had time to kill him yet.]

Annie Stoakes: Hey soldier, ready to do some fighting?

Soldier: Just point me in the right direction, ma’am.

Annie Stoakes: You two go on and look for the governor. I’m going to stay here and find Mr. Swift.

[She leaves and Red and the soldier burst into the governor’s office with guns in their hands. The governor’s chair turns its back to the heroes and someone sits in it, but it is not the governor himself, but his man, Jason Cornet.]

Jason Cornet: I’m afraid the Governor is otherwise occupied. Next time, I suggest you make an appointment, only there ain’t going to be no next time.

[There is a duel between him and Red. Red kills the old man. Afterwards, he and the soldier go to the roof. The governor hides there on a small enclosed terrace, surrounded by three of his men with rifles.]

Fall From Grace
"Governor Griffon has probably never ever seen the roof of his precious mansion before. Ironocally, it might be the last thing he ever sees."

Governor Griffon: You got no chance son, best you just turn around and keep on going. Ain’t no shame in cheating death twice.

Soldier: I’ve got some nitro I found there in the Governor office, you lay down some fire and I’ll take that gate right down.

[Red kills the governor’s men and a soldier puts a pack of dynamite under the gate, blowing it up along with part of the wall. The door flies off and covers the soldier. Red tries to help him, but to no avail - the iron door is too heavy.]

Soldier: Best way to help me is to put a bullet in that man’s brain. Get going, Bounty Hunter!

[Red gets into a much-anticipated fight with the governor. After putting several bullets into his body, the governor comes out of his hiding place to fight Red one-on-one.]

Governor Griffon: I always regretted what happened back on your daddy’s farm, Red. I should have been there, to make sure you joined them. But lucky for me, I get a second chance.

[A duel occurs between them and Red kills the governor. After a while the sheriff arrives and the governor’s corpse is brought into the garden. The sheriff kicks the corpse.]

Sheriff Bartlett: Never did like him much.

[Annie takes the wounded soldier out of the manor.]

Red Harlow: Jack?

[She doesn’t answer.]

Sheriff Bartlett: Well Red, I’m not saying Griffon didn’t deserve it, but he was the Governor. I reckon the army will be sniffing around here and… Well I’d hate to see you hang after all you’ve done. $5000 in gold sound like a fair bounty?

[Red takes out his revolver and hands it to the soldier. He takes the revolver from the governor. As he walks up to the sheriff, he points to the bag of money.]

Red Harlow: Give it to them. It was never about the money.

[He walks off into the sunset.]

THE END
