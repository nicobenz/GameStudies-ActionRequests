[We return to the swamps by the time Ethan had to choose whether to use the serum on Mia or Zoe. Judging by the white hue in the image, what we see is a flashback. Zoe’s flashback.]

Ethan: I had to use one of them. There's only one left.

[He injects the serum in Mia’s arm.]

Zoe: It’s fine. It was foolish thinking I could escape.

Mia: I'm sure there's someone who can help—

Zoe: This is my home. Apparently, I belong here.

Ethan: I'll send help.

Zoe: Don't bother! There won't be anyone left to help.

[Let's get back to the present. Zoe walks slowly through the swamps. Her stomach begins to hurt.]

Zoe: No—Evie! Please!

[It turns into a statue of white mold. Some time passes. A man approaches the two talking soldiers in Chris's unit.]

Soldier 1: What the…? We got a casualty here.

Soldier 2: Hey, I think she’s one of the…

Man: (approaching) What the hell you boys up to?

Soldier 1: That's her alright. Zoe Baker. She's still breathing. Call it in to HQ.

Man: Did you say Zoe?

Soldier 1: Sir, do you live here?

Man: What the hell's wrong with her?

Soldier 2: Sir, we trying to help...

Man: Zoe! What in god's name have you done?

[The man hits the soldier in full gear and mask several times with his bare hands and the soldier falls to the ground.]

Soldier 1: Stop! Stop!

[The man does the same wild trick to the second soldier and falls to his knees near Zoe’s body.]

Man: Oh my goodness... Zoe... What the hell did they do to you?

[Some more time passes. Zoe's body is moved to the man’s shed. She is barely breathing. Soldier 1 is standing next to the body. He’s arms in tied up.]

Soldier 1: Listen to me. We're here to help.

[We see the face of a man. He is an aging farmer of sturdy build, with white hair and a thick white beard. There are several scars on his face. Everything tells us that this man can easily stand up for himself.]

Old Man: (sits on a chair) No, I don't believe you, boy. Tell me—what kind of help comes in a helicopter gunship.

Soldier 1: You don't know what you're talkin' about. You don't get it!

Old Man: (in loud voice) You think I don't know who you people are? With all these monsters runnin' around here. Tell me where'd they come from?

Soldier 1: It's not what you think. You don't understand! (screams) Oh I don't understand?

Old Man: (grabs a machete) Oh I don’t understand? (threatens the soldier) You see that girl back there? Look! That there my brother's little girl. My niece. You understand?

[He punches the soldier in full gear and starts kicking him.]

Old Man: And around here family is a righteous cause! And you ain't gonna kill my family! Now see, that ain't somethin' I can abide.

Soldier 1: For fuck's sake. She's infected—she's dying—and we're both gonna fuckin' die if we don't get the fuck outta here right now!

Old Man: She ain't dead yet, boy! So I figure you better do something about it. Before I feed you to your little friends outside.

Soldier 1: ОК, ОК! There's a cure.

Old Man: You're lying to me. (punches the soldier)

Soldier 1: I'm not lying… I'm not lying. We were on our way to get her treatment, and you fucked that up when you jumped us! They're probably still waiting for us right now!

Old Man: Where?

Soldier 1: They took it to an old shack not too far from here. It's there, I swear!

Old Man: We're gonna fix this, Zoe. You're my family.

[He takes a look around his shed and reads a diary.]

That was no gator I saw today.
Was out checking the lines when I saw I had one so I pulled it up. Instead it was some sludge-covered God knows what with huge teeth and claws. Tried to get at me so I punched the fucker's teeth in before it could.
Never thought I'd see it with my own eyes.
Goddamn government doing secret experiments on people and animals no doubt about it.
Explains those helicopters flying about recently.

[Old Man pulls out a diary from his inventory. Judging by the cover, the name of the old man is Joe Baker.]

How to kill those things:
1. Bodies are tough, but heads are soft - punch them
2. Get in as many fast punches as possible. Left, right, right with some fast right jabs works good. Right, left, right, then a strong left knocks them out.
3. Heads crush easily underfoot when they fall down
4. Crouch and sneak up behind when not looking to take them out without a fight

[Joe goes out to the swamps.]

Joe Baker: Alright, you moldy motherfucker. I can take you fuckers with my bare hands.

[He punches a goo zombie to death.]

Joe Baker: Die, motherfucker!

[Joe finds the shed the soldier was talking about and finds there... only a soldier's corpse covered in white mold.]

Joe Baker: What the...

[The soldier holding a syringe with Cure for E-Type Infection. A black slurry starts oozing out of his eyes. Joe quickly retrieves the syringe.]

Joe Baker: Jesus Christ...

[He punches more goo zombies and eats a huge larva to restore his health.]

Joe Baker: Not bad.

[As he approaches his shed, he notices a fire.]

Joe Baker: No... No, no, no...

[He runs to the shed. Zoe coughs but can’t leave the couch she’s lying on. The soldier lies on the floor tied up.]

Joe Baker: Zoe! Alright now...now just—just let it work...

[He injects Zoe with the cure and she stops coughing… for a brief moment.]

Joe Baker: Goddamnit, why ain't it working...?

Soldier 1: It wasn't full, was it? It won't be enough. She needs a full dose to heal completely! There's more at our base. Just untie me and I'll take you there. Please!

Joe Baker: What base?

[Suddenly something grabs the soldier through the wall and eats half of him.]

Joe Baker: Shit! I gotta get Zoe outta here... (grabs Zoe) We gotta get going.

[A beefy zombie that looks exactly like Swamp Thing tries to pull Zoe out too.]

Joe Baker: No!

[He takes Zoe to his boat.]

Joe Baker: Holy god, this is some horror movie bullshit.

[He sails away leaving the Swamp Thing behind in his burning shed.]

Joe Baker: OK, it's OK now Zoe… Goddamn it all.

[He and Zoe float through the swamps]

Joe Baker: Soldier boy said the meds were at some kind of base.

[He swims up to the lowered gateway blocking the river.]

Joe Baker: Now where in all of hell did this wall come from...? Looks like somebody left the lights on. That's good enough for me.

[He's mooring the boat at the dock and takes Zoe in his arms.]

Joe Baker: Don't you worry, Zoe. Just a little further.

[An alligator splashes in the water nearby.]

Joe Baker: Aw come on. Not now, gator.

[He brings Zoe in some shead.]

Joe Baker: OK. You'll be safe here. Now just you wait here. I'll be back with something to make you better.

[Joe explores an abandoned military camp and fights zombies. While exploring the field lab, he finds a note.]

Orders are as follows, effective immediately:
The mutamycete is on the loose in the swamp, and it'll keep mutating as it encounters new organisms. We can't allow the stock of medicine compounds to be exposed—if they suffer a mutation they'll be useless.
Transfer the whole anti-infective synthesizing station over to the paddle boat.

Joe Baker: The paddle boat? Dammit, you boys ain't making this simple.

[Soon he faces the Swamp Thing. The freak walks in like a Tyrant.]

Joe Baker: You!? You best stay back now...

[He fights the freak like a man with his bare fists. After a few minutes of fierce fighting, Joe wins.]

Joe Baker: You ain't gonna bother us no more!

[But the Swamp Thing is not that easily defeated...]

Joe Baker:What? Come on. Just stay down!

[He has to drop the Swamp Thing on the floor. After some time of searching, Joe finds the component for Zoe’s medicine...]

Joe Baker:That's gotta be the medicine.

[He tries to synthesize the cure, but the machine stops working.]

Joe Baker:What? Aww, come on!

[He punches the machine a few times and it completes the process.]

Joe Baker: This is it. Finally.

[However, Swamp Thing is already waiting for him from behind. He grabs Joe and lifts him off the floor. He throws Joe to the floor and he falls into the basement. Swamp Thing jumps in after him.]

Joe Baker: OK. You want some? Come and get it, you pile of puke!

[They brutally fight each other.]

Joe Baker: Here we go!

[He throws a Swamp Thing like in a wrestling match.]

Joe Baker: Haha! What's wrong?

[The Swamp Thing gets mad and punches Joe several times.]

Joe Baker: Not bad, little guy! Fuck you!

[He grabs the Swamp Thing and rips his head off, then throws it into the swamp.]

Joe Baker: Now that's how you get it done! (clenches a syringe of medicine in his fist) I'm coming for you, Zoe.

[He runs to the shed.]

Joe Baker: Zoe! I brought your medicine. You're gonna be fine.

[However... Swamp Thing appears and drags Zoe into the swamps.]

Joe Baker: No—Zoe!!! Shit!

[He jumps to his boat.]

Joe Baker: Zoe!? Where are you, girl? Where'd they go...

[He notices that Swamp Thing is taking Zoe away behind the floodgate.]

Joe Baker: Hey! Leave my family alone, asshole!

[He follows the Thing but… it vanishes into thin air.]

Joe Baker: You're gonna get it.

[He sails slowly down the river in his boat, surveying the surroundings.]

Joe Baker: Damn... This whole place's gone to hell. He's gotta be up ahead.

[Joe moors the boat and goes into the woods. He fights a beefy zombie in an old cemetery.]

Joe Baker: Outta the way, fat fuck.

[He finds Zoe in a dilapidated church nearby.]

Joe Baker: It's a goddamn sacrilege.

[But the Swamp Thing’s already waiting for him. They start fighting again. Joe pulls his head away like a mask and sees... Jack Baker's face.]

Joe Baker: Jack? What the fuck—

[Jack laughs and knocks Joe out with one punch. When Joe comes to, Jack shoves him into a box.]

Joe Baker: Goddamnit, Jack! Don't you remember your own brother?

[He punched the roof of the box.]

Joe Baker: (angerly) Don't do it! Don't you touch her! Jack! Let me the fuck outta here! I'm your family! How the fuck could you do this to me? Get me the fuck outta here, Jack!

[Jack throws the box into the swamps. Joe is drowning in muddy swamp water. He desperately resists, but after a while he loses the creature. Joe wakes up in the forest.]

Joe Baker: Goddamnit. (coughs) Aw hell, Jacky-boy... What's happened to you?

[He walks past Umbrella boats and hears a radio.]

Radio: Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We've been engaged by an unknown bioweapon. Baker House Camp under attack! Gotta be the same thing that attacked base! What the fuck... He's not going down! Pull back! Pull back!

Joe Baker: There you are you sonofabitch… let's do this.
[He runs to the Baker house. On the way, he finds a box... with a power glove in it.]

Joe Baker: What the hell is this? One of their fancy toys?

[He puts the glove on his left hand.]

Glove: Ready for use.

[Now Joe can smash through any zombie with one mighty blow.]

Joe Baker: God damn! This just might be what I need to put ol' Jack down for good.

[He enters the house in the very place where Ethan and Mia was hiding from Marguerite. Joe walks through the water house destroying zombies.]

Joe Baker: I said get OUTTA MY WAY! He's gotta be up ahead.

[Joe goes out into the courtyard. Many military tents set up by Chris's team appear around. There’s bodies everywhere.]

Joe Baker: Jesus, what happened here?

[He goes into one of the tents and finds a report.]

We've finished analyzing the tissue samples believed to be from Jack Baker.
The cells exhibit an extraordinary resilience to physical and chemical damage; the E-Series mutamycete secretes a telomerase-like enzyme through the cell wall, causing abnormal activation of the ERK pathway to achieve forced cell division—quickly regenerating damaged tissue.
However, the repeated cell division quickly leads to breakdown in the intercellular structure, leading to the sloughing, slurry-like effect we've observed in the collected tissue samples.
Our working hypothesis puts this down to the cells reaching their Hayflick limit.
Note that the samples from the other family members (the wife Marguerite, the son Lucas, and the daughter Zoe) do not exhibit the same extreme regenerative properties.
The symptoms may differ from subject to subject.
Further study required.

Joe Baker: Just you wait. Jack. Zoe's coming with me.

[He enters the house and Zoe is put on a chair.]

Joe Baker: Zoe! Zoe! Zoe, wake up! Wake up!

[Suddenly Monster Jack appears.]

Joe Baker: You're just a rabid dog now. And I'm gonna put you outta your misery.

[They start fighting like men.]

Joe Baker: Bring it on!

[They fight for a while. Thanks to the gauntlet, Joe gets the upper hand.]

Joe Baker: Yeah! You remember me, right? (punches Jack) You remember the time I broke your nose when we were kids? You remember when I clotheslined you into the swamp?

[They continue fighting. Monster Jack gets mad and grabs Joe and throws him on the floor.]

Joe Baker: You never had it in ya! You were a wimp, Jack! Never could beat me! Just cause you're a monster now, don't mean I can't still kick your ass!

Monster Jack: Shit up, shiit up, shit up! Die!

[They fight some more. Finally Joe grabs Jack’s head.]

Joe Baker: (charging the glove) This is a farewell from the family, brother!

[He smashes through Jack’s face.]

Joe Baker: Zoe…! Zoe... Hang in there. You're gonna be alright now. (inject the cure in her arm) Zoe? Zoe!  Wake up, Zoe!

Zoe: Joe! What happened… are… are you OK?

Joe Baker: I'm fine, don't you worry about me. It's all over now.

[A few soldiers rushed into the house.]

Chris: Go go go go!

Soldier: Don't move! Get your hands up! Get down!

Chris: Weapons down. Weapons down! It's alright. You must be Zoe Baker.

Joe Baker: Who the hell's asking?

Chris: Chris Redfield. We've been looking all over for you. We're here to help.

[After a while, Zoe lies in the medical tent on a gurney.]

Soldier 2: (pats Zoe on the shoulder) You're gonna be just fine.

[Soldier 2 leaves the tent. Joe enters.]

Zoe: (stands up) I was trapped with those monsters for 3 years—all of them trying to kill me… I can't believe it's finally over.

Joe Baker: Ya gotta know, deep down somewhere, they were still your family and they loved you. Especially your daddy… even in his final days.

Chris: (to his phone) We found her. She's a tough kid. Yeah, of course. Hang on. (to Zoe) Someone wants to speak to you.

[He hands her the phone.]

Ethan: Zoe? Zoe are you there?

Zoe: It's you! I don't believe it. You actually made it.

Ethan: We both did.

Zoe: You didn't forget about me.

Ethan: I told you I'd send help. And I always keep my promises.

Zoe: Thank you, Ethan.

[She smiles.]

THE END
