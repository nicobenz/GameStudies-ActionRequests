Well, here we are, Yakuza 5! It seems like only recently (in 2018) I was working on Yakuza 0 and wondering if I could finish it! And now here we are. Well, let's get started. It's going to be a loooong journey. For transcribing, I use the remastered version of the game that I play, so I don't know if there are differences from the original version.

This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

December 2012
Nagasugai, Fukuoka

{Fukuoka is a major port in southwestern Japan, located on the island of Kyushu. This island is not far from Okinawa (about 2 hours by plane), and quite far from Tokyo (about 12 hours by shinkansen).}

[Night. Townspeople scurry back and forth through the streets, cab drivers wait for new passengers, and a few young men drink merrily and carelessly at a nearby diner. A white limousine rushes down the road. In the backseat we see Daigo and some old man in traditional Japanese clothes. Meanwhile, two drunken young men are walking down the street. Unexpectedly, they run into two gangs facing each other on opposite sides of the street. The first gang wears red hoodies and medical masks. The other half wears strict black suits. Both gangs look at each other with anger and mistrust. The young men decide to run away quietly. A limousine with Daigo and an old man enters between them. Daigo's Subordinate opens the door for him.]

Daigo's Subordinate: Welcome back, Chairman Dojima. 

Daigo: Thanks! (to the old man) Now then, Patriarch Madarame. I hope you give this matter some consideration. (bows) 

Patriarch Madarame: You seem to be a trustworthy man. And despite my sudden request... You agreed to cancel our hotel meeting and convene in my private car instead. An intimate space. No room for bodyguards to protect you. Your very life could have been in danger. And yet, you still got in. Still chose to meet with me. 

[TADASHI MADARAME. Patriarch of the Yamagasa Family.]

Daigo: I hope that shows you how seriously me and my clan are taking this alliance. That, and I couldn't imagine the honorable leader of Kyushu's Yamagasa Family resorting to trickery. (bows) Your turf, your rules. While we're in Fukuoka, I fully intend to follow them, Patriarch Madarame. 

Patriarch Madarame: You run a clan of over 30 thousand, yet you defer to a man with less than 500 soldiers to his name? 

Daigo: Correct. After all... That's what it means to be an equal alliance. 

Patriarch Madarame: I see. You show as much decency as you do daring. It's no surprise you've come to lead the Tojo Clan at such a young age. As for the alliance, I have much to consider, but I am hopeful. My response will come within the week. 

Daigo: I'll be waiting. Take care, in the meantime. This world is a dangerous one, Patriarch. (bows and leaves the car)

[The limo drives away. The bald gang leader in red hoodie addresses his subordinates.]

Bald Leader: Scram. 

[When his subordinates leave, the leader bows to Daigo, but smirks afterward as if he has no respect for him at all. The bald leader walks away.]

Daigo: Who was that? 

Daigo's Subordinate: The captain of the Yamagasa Family. A man named Yahata. Head of his own family as well. 

[He nods to the other yakuzas and they leave. Daigo pulls out a cigarette. His subordinate immediately pulls out a lighter.]

Daigo's Subordinate: I'm glad you've returned unharmed, Chairman. 

[MINORU AOYAMA. Tojo Clan Chief of Headquarters, Patriarch of the Aoyama Family.]

Aoyama: Canceling the hotel meeting was quite a surprise. I wasn't sure what to expect. 

Daigo: Our counterparts here are no fools. They have no reason to go stirring up trouble. 

Aoyama: I agree, but... 

Daigo: Not to mention, we're pressuring them into this. An alliance they normally would never consider. I anticipated at least some risk. 

[A car pulls up.]

Aoyama: We should make our way back to the hotel. It's not safe staying in the open for too long. 

[But Daigo walks away.]

Aoyama: Chairman? Chairman Dojima? Where are you going? 

Daigo: The trip to Fukuoka was a long one. I need some time alone to unwind. Don't worry, I won't be gone long. No need to accompany me. (walks away)

Aoyama: (to his men) You two. 

[He nods towards Daigo. Meanwhile, Daigo approaches the cab drivers standing nearby. He deliberately walks to one of the cars and knocks on the window.]

Daigo: Mind giving me a lift? I said I'd like a ride. 

[The driver in a mask and glasses who is not Kiryu at all lowers the window of the door.]

Driver: Then ask the taxi at the front. That's how this works. 

Daigo: No. I think I'd prefer this one. You have no reason to turn me away. And drivers can't refuse a paying customer without justification. 

[The driver stays silent. Daigo sits in the taxi.]

Driver: Where to, sir? 

Daigo: Just drive. I don't care where. 

[The icon on the cab changes from red 空車 (empty car) to 賃走 (occupied). The taxi pulls off. After some time of silent driving, Daigo notices the driver's license on the torpedo.]

Daigo: Nice town. I see why so many people have ended up here. Have you been driving long? 

Driver: About six months now. 

Daigo: That's all? I guess you don't quite have the lay of the land yet, then. 

Driver: Not really.

Daigo: Shame. I was hoping you'd be able to fill me in on what life is like down here. The truth is, I'm from Tokyo myself. I've only come to Fukuoka for some pressing business dealings. Ah, well. If you don't mind, I'm going to think out loud for a bit. Please pay it no mind. I actually run a company over in Tokyo. It's one of the largest in the country, with 30,000 employees. Business has been bad for the past few years, and at one point we were in danger of going under, but now we've turned things around. The main reason things stabilized was a business partnership with a competitor in Kansai. Our company and the one in Kansai had been rivals for many years, and competition between us was fierce. But as times changed, the companies in our line of work were forced to undergo reform in order to stay in business. Otherwise we'd fall behind the times. Faced with this impending crisis, we mediated a business alliance to weather these harsh times together. But now something is threatening to drive our companies apart. Unless I do something, it could trigger conflict that would lead to one of us faltering. The president of the other firm is gravely ill. He has less than a month. Terminal lung cancer. He was known to be a man of wisdom, and I placed a lot of trust in him. But now he will need to be replaced, and the next president will be chosen. Unfortunately, the candidates could prove to be somewhat problematic for us. There are three of them. The vice president, a self-made man. The managing director, who rules the Osaka business scene. And a director favored by the president. Each has what it takes to grasp the reins in their own way. Another thing they all have in common is their dislike of our firm. Let's just say they have an aggressive stance. If one of them becomes the next president, our arrangement would be null and void. Lines would be drawn between East and West again, pitting all of Honshu against itself. That's why I'm here in Fukuoka. To seek opportunities with other like-minded companies outside of Kansai. Mergers and acquisitions, you might say. And in the event Of direct competition, we want as many people on our side as possible. I've sent people to Nagoya and Sapporo, too. I hope their talks are going well... 

{Nagoya, located in the Aichi Prefecture west of Tokyo, is one of the largest ports in Japan and a major administrative center (about 2 hours by shinkansen from Tokyo). Sapporo, located in Hokkaido Prefecture, is one of Japan's largest northern cities (about 14 hours by shinkansen from Tokyo).}

[After driving a few more kilometers, the driver stops the cab on the side of the road.]

Daigo: Where are we? I never said anything about stopping. 

Driver: You can forget about the fare. I can't keep driving you without a concrete destination, sir. 

Daigo: You're telling me to just walk home, then? 

[The driver changes the sign from 賃走 (occupied) to 空車 (empty car). Daigo smirks.]

Daigo: I get it. I need to learn how to find my own way forward. 

[He’s about to leave the taxi…]

Daigo: It may not always seem it… But I'm trying my best to walk this path. Fourth Chairman.

[The drives silently pull off. Daigo walks up to the fence by the river, lights a cigarette, but a minute later throws it into the water. The title of the game appears.]

[Deciding to take a break and eat, Kiryu drives his taxi to the parking area.]

稲荷山PA 
INARIYAMA PARKING AREA
ドライブイン そば・うどん (Drive-in Soba/Udon Noodles)

[The names of the voice actors appear on the screen. Kiryu gets out of the car with the handbrake on. He walks into a little noodle place. Other taxi drivers have lunch there as well. Kiryu hands some money to the old lady behind the counter.]

Old Lady: Thank ya kindly. Bowl of kake!

{Kake soba is a simple Japanese soba noodle soup. It's just dashi stock with soba and various toppings.}

Taxi Driver 1: Slim pickings again. Same as always. When's this economy gonna get out of the gutter?

Taxi Driver 2: Even the jobs I do get are regular ol one-way fares. It's just not right.

[Kiryu takes off his mask and aviator glasses.]

Old Lady: Kakesoba's ready!

[Two other taxi drivers are watching TV.]

Taxi Driver 1: These shows've been sproutin' up a lot lately, huh?

Taxi Driver 2: Y'can say that again. My daughter's glued to the things.

[Kiryu take a look at the screen too. It says 今話題の「プリンセスリーグ｣ 期待の新人 澤村運ちゃん直撃! (“The Princess League,” the hottest topic of the moment, and a direct interview with Sawamura-chan, a promising newcomer!) 澤村 遥(16) (Haruka Sawamura (16 years old). Haruka in a cute dress appears on the screen.]

Taxi Driver 2: Think I've seen this one.

Taxi Driver 1: They call it the Princess League. Some kinda competition for amateur idols to strut their stuff. Pretty sure the winner gets signed to some big-time label.

Taxi Driver 2: Bet they gotta strut their stuff in the bedroom, too, if you get me. All these idol types sleep their way up the ladder. Stay too long in the biz and it's gonna twist you up somethin' fierce.

Taxi Driver 1: No doubt about that. Not a fly's chance in a farmstead I'd let my daughter on somethin' like this. Y'ask me, it comes down to the parents. Dig a bit and you'll find they're all chasin' some long lost dream. Not a single thought fer the wolves they're tossing their kid to.

[Kiryu angrily throws his bowl on the table and leaves the diner.]

Old Lady: Come again!

[He gets in his cab and drives away. All the while, an old man with short hair is watching him. He sits at the bus stop and smokes.]

PART 1 KAZUMA KIRYU
Chapter 1: THE WANDERER
[Kiryu brings his cab to the parking lot in front of the taxi company where he works, Nagasu Taxi Co. He starts washing the car and then, grabbing a suitcase with money, enters the office.]

Kiryu: Here are my fares.

Accountant: Oh, Suzuki-san! Good to see you.

Boss: Been waitin' for ya!

Kiryu: Nakajima, sir. Good evening. (bows)

Nakajima: Got somethin' to talk to you about. Mind steppin' into my "office"?

[Kiryu follows Nakajima.]

Nakajima: So... you took on a passenger from the middle of the line today, right? Tenjin Transportation came bellyachin' about it.

Kiryu: Oh...

Nakajima: We get enough flak from the other firms as it is. Mind bein' a bit more careful?

Kiryu: (bows) Sorry for the trouble, sir. It was an amateur mistake.

Nakajima: Ah, don't be so hard on yerself. I'm about to head over there with some cakes or what have ya and apologize.

Kiryu: No. I should be the one to go.

Nakajima: Like heck ya should. It's my company, so I've gotta do this.

Kiryu: Please, I insist.

Nakajima: Yeah? Guess I'll leave it in yer hands, then. You know where Tenjin Transportation is, right? Over on West Gion Street.

Kiryu: Got it.

Nakajima: Well, hope everythin' goes well. Call me after you're done there.

[Kiryu leaves the office.]

Kiryu: (I need to go to Tenjin Transportation and apologize. That should set things right.)

Head for Tenjin Transportation
[Kiryu walks out to the street.]

Kiryu: (I'd better not show up to apologize empty-handed. Maybe I've got something good on me... If not, I should buy a gift first. I think Tenjin Transportation is on West Gion Street.) 

[Kiryu goes into the store and buys a gift. After wandering around the city, he finds a sign.]

タクシー乗るなら (If you want a cab…)
天神交通 (Tenjin Transportation)
TEL:092-XXX-XXXX

Kiryu: (Tenjin Transportation. This is the place. Okay, time to go apologize. I hope the gift I brought is good enough...) 

Maybe I should rethink this. 
It'll be fine. ✓

Kiryu: (All right, here I go.) 

[He enters the office.]

Kiryu: Excuse me, is the president here? 

Chubby Driver: That'd be me. And you are? 

Kiryu: Suzuki, from Nagasu Taxi. I broke the rules today when I picked up a passenger midway through the line, so I'm here to apologize. 

Tenjin Transportation President: Oh, so that was you? Guess y'take after your boss Nakajima. No sense among the lot of ya.

Kiryu: …I'm not sure I understand. 

Tenjin Transportation President: I'm sayin' we get monkeys like you breakin' rules left, right, and center 'cause Nakajima won't train his drivers worth a damn. 

Kiryu: Now just a minute.

Tenjin Transportation President: Huh, figures ya'd get uppity. That Nakajima's a real scum o' the earth kinda guy. Makes sense he'd hire the same. That circus he's runnin' is bound to go bust any day now. 

Kiryu: Please, sir. Just let me say my piece. 

Tenjin Transportation President: Your piece, huh? Fine. I’m listenin'. 

Kiryu: What happened today was completely my fault, sir. Nakajima trained me in all the rules to follow, and I failed to follow them. I won't let it happen again, I assure you. (bows) Please, accept this as my apology. (What to give...?) 

[He gives the present that he recently bought.]

Tenjin Transportation President: You call this an apology? You gotta be kiddin' me. 

Kiryu: Is something the matter? 

Tenjin Transportation President: Hmph. Well, you just be sure not to break protocol again! 

Kiryu: (bows) I'll take that to heart. Thank you for your time. 

[He walks out of Tenjin Transportation and calls his boss.]

Nakajima: Hello? 

Kiryu: It's Suzuki. I went and apologized to Tenjin Transportation. 

Nakajima: Good… good. They give ya any trouble? 

Kiryu: Not really. I'd say it went pretty okay. 

Nakajima: Whew, great to hear. Truth be told, the owner over at Tenjin kinda scares me. 

Kiryu: Does he now? 

Nakajima: Yeah, y'really did me a solid goin' to handle that yourself.

Kiryu: Well, it was my fault, after all. It's only right that I sort it out.  

Nakajima: Cut that humility mumbo jumbo outta here, Suzuki-san. I wasn't about to give ya the axe or anything. What's done is done. Don't go frettin' over it. 

Kiryu: Either way, I won't let it happen again. Well, then... 

Nakajima: Just a swingin' sec there. It's payday, right? How bout we hit the town?  

Kiryu: There's something I need to take care of, but I'll be free after that. 

Nakajima: Sendin' money off again? Bet ya don't keep even half yer paycheck these days. 

Kiryu: Yeah, well... 

Nakajima: I don't mean to pry or anythin', but did ya leave family behind when you came here? 

Kiryu: Not family in the traditional sense. It’s kind of hard to explain. 

Nakajima: Fair enough. I won't go gettin' too personal. I just wanna see you with cash in yer pocket and a smile on yer face.

Kiryu: Thank you for understanding, sir. 

Nakajima: C'mon, y'don't have to be so formal with me. Loosen up! Either way, ain't no better time than payday to hit the bars and blow off some steam! I'll go on ahead. Meet me at Ose Bridge. 

Kiryu: See you there. (First things first. I have to send that money. Better get to a convenience store.)

[He finds an M-Store nearby.]

Kiryu: (Should be able to use the ATM in here for the transfer. There's the ATM. I'd better get that bank transfer done so I can go meet Nakajima-san. I should send some money back to Morning Glory. I'm thinking 10,000 yen at least... I know how much they need it.)

[Kiryu sends 10,000 yen to Morning Glory Orphanage. If you don't know anything about it, read Yakuza 3 first. 10,000 yen is about $80.]

Kiryu: (It looks like the money went through okay. That should do for now.)

[He leaves the store.]

Kiryu: (Time to head over and meet the chief.)

[Some guy, clearly a yakuza, approaches Kiryu.]

Suspicious Man: Hey, pal. I saw you usin' the ATM in there. Y'mind spottin' me some cash? I'm starvin' here. 

Kiryu: Sorry, but it was just a bank transfer. I don't have anything on me. 

[He wants to leave but two more yakuzas block his way.]

Suspicious Man: Pfft, ya think I'm gonna fall for that? I know you got the goods on you. Now fork 'em over!

Kiryu: Sorry, but I don't have time for this. (walks away)

Suspicious Man: Y'think ya can just walk away from me!? Yer gonna get it good, ya stingy prick! 

Kiryu: (stops) ...Fine. Let’s get this over with. 

[He wipes the asphalt with the morons.]

Suspicious Man: Okay, okay! I give! 

Kiryu: Then get lost. I don't want the police involved any more than you do. Besides, I have somewhere to be. 

Suspicious Man: Aaaaaaugh! 

[He and his girlfriends ran away.]

Kiryu: (Things could get messy if someone really did call the cops. Better hurry on over to Ose Bridge and meet the chief.) 

[He finds the chief on Ose Bridge.]

Nakajima: There you are, Suzuki-san! 

Kiryu: Sorry I'm late, Chief. 

Nakajima: Your payment go through all right? 

Kiryu: Yeah.

Nakajima: Gotta say, frealiy do have it good, Suzuki-san. Guy my age should have a big ol' family by now, but I don't even have so much as a pet dog. 

Kiryu: You're still single, Chief? 

Nakajima: Well, somethin' in that neighborhood. Anyway, tonight's my treat, so lees stop livin' in the past and start livin' it up! Now c'mon. It’s time I gave ya a proper taste o' what this town's got to offer! 

Kiryu: Thank you, sir. 

[They decide to take a walk.]

Nakajima: So, you settled into Nagasugai yet? 

Kiryu: Yeah, mostly.

Nakajima: Y'got a problem, ya say so, hear me? Us Hakata folk don't feel right if we're not helpin' someone out. 

{Hakata-ku (博多区) is a district of the city of Fukuoka.}

Kiryu: You’ve done plenty, taking on an unqualified stranger like me. I couldn't ask for anything more. 

Nakajima: Not sure I'd call ya unqualified. I hired ya 'cause I knew you'd be perfect for the job. 

Kiryu: I have to ask, Chief. Why did you even approach me in the first place? 

Nakajima: Good question there. Mm, suppose I just, went with my gut. 

Kiryu: That’s it?

Nakajima: It’s hard to explain, but I only hire folks I really take a shine to. And Suzuki-san, y'seemed like a man could trust. That's why I asked ya on board. 

Kiryu: I didn't make a very good first impression, though. 

Nakajima: Heheh. Yeah, ya didn't exactly come off like a saint. But I been drivin' taxis for over thirty years now. Y’get to be a pretty good judge o' character. I could tell ya had a good heart. Wish ya'd start leanin' on me more, too. Guess not the most dependable-lookin' fella, though. 

Kiryu: Chief... Thank you for everything. I'm lucky I met you so soon after moving here. 

Nakajima: Heheh, you're makin' me blush like a beet. Now c'mon, let's paint this town redder than my face! 

Kiryu: Right.

Nakajima: Oh, this is the place! Hanamidori. Let's start with some of Hakata's famous mizutaki. 

{Mizutaki is a Japanese Chicken Hot Pot in which chicken, assorted vegetables, mushrooms, and tofu are cooked in a light kombu dashi broth.}

[They enter Hanamidori.]

Staff: (bows) Welcome! Table for two? Take any spot you like. 

[They pick a table.]

Nakajima: Folks would fight each other off with a stick for a taste o' this place's mizutaki. Y'can only get that kinda chicken hot pot right here in beautiful Fukuoka! But don't lemme stop ya from orderin' what you want! Go on, don't be shy. 

[Kiryu orders some food and a drink.]

Nakajima: Ahhh, nothin' beats a drink after a hard day's work! Oh, and here comes the food. Let's dig in, Suzuki-san. 

[They eat.]

Staff: (bows) Thank you very much.

Nakajima: Phew, that was great. Whaddya say, Suzuki-san? Y'like it? 

Kiryu: Definitely. Mizutaki is really something special. I love soy-based hot pots, but I never realized one made with chicken broth could be so good.

Nakajima: I getcha, I getcha. I'm guessin' yer from Kanto if yer all about that soy broth?

{The Kanto region is one of the largest and most urbanized in Japan. It is where Tokyo is located.}

Kiryu: Well, er... 

[They continue to stroll around town.]

Nakajima: Hehehe. Sorry, didn't mean to put ya on the spot like that. Bet y'got some skeletons in the closet. Ya always get so flustered when start pryin'. Anyway, glad y’liked the food. Now how bout we go knock back a few cold ones? 

Kiryu: I appreciate the offer, but haven't you had enough to drink, sir? 

Nakajima: I’m fine, I'm fine. They used t’call me the Iron Stomach, y'know! 

Kiryu: Did they, now?

Nakajima: C'mon, less questions n' more walkin’!

Kiryu: (He's pretty far gone, but I can tell he's enjoying himself. I'd better make sure he gets home okay.)

Nakajima: Huh? 

[He sees two jerks harassing a girl.]

Sleazy Jerk: Hey, babe. Don't y'know it's dangerous to be walkin' alone this late?

Creepy Jackass: Yup, real dangerous. How 'bout we take care o' ya for the night? 

Unassuming Lady: Thanks, but no thanks. Now if you'd just let me go... 

Sleazy Jerk: What's the rush? Pretty little thing like you should be puttin' her safety first. 

Creepy Jackass: Don't worry, we'll look after ya. But we'll be expectin' a lil somethin' somethin' in return. 

Unassuming Lady: Just leave me alone already. 

Nakajima: Y’deaf or somethin'!? 

Creepy Jackass: Huh? Can't ya tell we're busy over here, gramps? Whaddya want? 

Nakajima: I want ya to quit botherin' the little missus! Y'oughta be ashamed! 

Sleazy Jerk: If I wanted advice, I’d be phonin' a hotline! Now scram, old man! 

[He punches Nakajima.]

Nakajima: Ugh! Y’little…

Kiryu: That’s enough. 

Creepy Jackass: Huh? Who're you, his lameass drinkin' buddy? 

Sleazy Jerk: Drop yer wallet n' we might just let ya walk. Way cheaper than the hospital bill we're gonna give ya if y'don't. 

Kiryu: I wouldn't mind if you were just out trying to pick up girls. But threatening them? Assaulting my boss? Well, I can't let that slide. 

Sleazy Jerk: What, y'think ya can take us? C'mon, we'll put ya in stitches! 

[Kiryu kicks their asses in seconds.]

Creepy Jackass: ...This guy’s some kind of monster. 

Sleazy Jerk: He doesn't look like one o' the Yamagasa, though. Y'think he's with someone else? 

Kiryu: I suggest you stay out of other people's business. Unless you're in the mood for some more pain. 

Nakajima: Ease up, Suzuki-san. I think they've learned their lesson. Now get outta here. 

Sleazy Jerk: Our bad! 

[The jerks run away.]

Unassuming Lady: Thank you for stepping in. I was in a real pinch there. 

Nakajima: Eh, no biggie. Get yerself home safe, okay? Wouldn't want anyone worryin'. 

Unassuming Lady: Right. Oh, and thank you, too. 

Kiryu: It was nothing. 

Unassuming Lady: Well, good night. 

[The girl leaves.]

Nakajima: Y'sure pack a punch, Suzuki-sam I knew y’were tough, but ya walloped those poor saps into next week and back! 

Kiryu: It was just a fluke. 

Nakajima: Oh yeah? Eh, whatever. Onto the next stop! 

[A young guy meanwhile watching the whole thing standing nearby…]

Dashing Young Lad: Hmm…

[Kiryu and Nakajima approach a food stall.]

Nakajima: Y'want the real Hakata experience, no better place than one o' these here food stalls. 

Kiryu: They do always seem to be packed full of paying customers. 

Nakajima: You betcha. Droppin' by for a nightcap after y'filled yer belly somewhere else is practically a Hakata tradition. 

Kiryu: That explains it.

Nakajima: Now c'mon, we're goin' in! 

[Inside, at the counter…]

Nakajima: Man, this is trawlin' up some old memories. You n' I first met afine o' these food stalls, remember? 

Kiryu: Of course. Hard to believe it's already been six months since then. 

Nakajima: Y'practically gave me a heart attack. I remember y’jumped in to help some lady who was gettin' harassed at a stall nearby. Those punks gave ya the beatin' of a lifetime after that. Dunno how it all went down, but with the pummelin' they were givin' ya I swore y’were a goner. 

Kiryu: Not my fondest memory. 

Nakajima: Don't be silly. That's when I knew ya weren't some joe. Gotta be a stand-up guy if y'can stand up straight after somethin' like that.  

Kiryu: I'm not so sure.

Nakajima: That's when I knew I gotta help you. It was obvious y'were the kinda guy I could trust with my life.

Kiryu: I can't thank you enough for the opportunity, Nakajima, sir.

Nakajima: Pfft, I should be thankin' you. I always wanted my company to be a place where people like you can come to make an honest livin'. 

Kiryu: What do you mean? 

Nakajima: Y’heard me. Lot of folks wanna live a good life, but a troubled past or some zany circumstance keeps chaining 'em down. Take an old fart like me. I been through it. Know how life can take a decent guy, chew him up good, then spit him out on his keister with nothin' left to lose. Darn tragic if ya ask me. Truth is, I lost most everythin' that was important to me. All ‘cause of somethin' I thought was right at the time... But that's why I'm so trustin' now. 'Cause I know what it means to fall on hard times. How much it can mean t'have someone in yer corner. Made me think. How could I not bring ya on? Y'looked so alone, too. It was like lookin' at a younger me in the mirror. Nobody makes it all by 'emselves on this earth. Gotta have at least a few good pals, don't ya think? 

Kiryu: Chief…

Nakajima: That company's all I'm livin' for these days. The closest thing to a family I got. So drop all that formality baloney, will ya? I’m just another member of the team. 'Kay? 

Kiryu: Got it. 

Nakajima: Enough o' this sorry little speech, though. I'm grabbin' a nice, crisp highball for a much-needed change o’ pace! One highball over here!

Kiryu: Hey, Chief? 

Nakajima: Huh? You want one too, Suzuki-san? 

Kiryu: No, it’s just... You've been talking so openly about yourself, but I…

Nakajima: Hm? This about yer past? 

Kiryu: Yes.

Nakajima: Didn't I promise not t'ask you about that? Don't worry, y’just keep those cards close to yer chest. 

Kiryu: But…

Nakajima: Suzuki-san. I don't got the foggiest 'bout what brought ya to Nagasu. But... if an honest fella like you is keepin' something locked away, it's prob’ly best to leave it that way. If y'go and spill the beans now, then what was the point of keepin' it a secret in the first place? Well, if the cops ever haul ya in on a traffic violation or somethin’, y'can tell me all about it then. Who knows what kinda mess I’d be gettin' dragged into otherwise! 

Kiryu: Thank you, sir.

Nakajima: Don't think a thing of it. Oh, but there was somethin' I wanted to ask ya about. 

Kiryu: What is it? 

Nakajima: That pretty gal y'helped out when we first met. Y'keep in touch with her since then? 

Kiryu: Oh... no. That’s not really my style. 

Nakajima: Damn shame there! She was a real looker. Not many girls like that 'round Nagasu, y’know! 

Kiryu: I haven't noticed. 

Nakajima: Can't quite picture her face anymore, but I remember she was gorgeous. I'd have at least got her number if I was in yer shoes! 

Kiryu: All right... But why are you bringing that up now? 

Nakajima: Hm? Y'don't know, Suzuki-san? The other drivers have been talk somethin' fierce about ya lately. 

Kiryu: Huh?

Nakajima: Now there ain't nothin' wrong with this, but there've been some rumors…

[He tells Kiryu the rumor.]

Kiryu: …Me?

Nakajima: Well, yer single in yer forties, never go out drinkin', and won't even step foot in a cabaret club or nothin'. Can't blame the boys for wonderin'. 

Kiryu: Well, I... 

Nakajima: Y'what? Yer actually married or somethin’? 

Kiryu: No, that's not it. 

Nakajima: Then y’brought this on yerself, what with you bein' so straight-laced all the time. I know it ain't your thing, but I reckon it'd be nice if "ined us fer drinks at a hostess club one o' these days. Little change of pace, y'know? 

Kiryu: …Okay.

Nakajima: Okay? Y’just agreed to it, right? 

Kiryu: Well yeah, but... 

Nakajima: Great. then let's get goin’! We gotta grab life by the horns! 

Kiryu: Huh?

[They leave the stall.]

Kiryu: It's getting pretty late, Chief. Another spot might be overdoing it a little. 

Nakajima: C'mon, y’agreed to it n' everythin! A man never goes back on his word! Right, Suzuki-san!? 

Kiryu: I… guess.

Nakajima: Don’t get yer briefs in a bunch! I know yer always savin' up cash to send off somewhere. so tonight's a hundred percent on me! All I'm askin' is one lil cabaret club! (jumps cheerfully)

Kiryu: (lowers his head) If that's all it'll be.

[They go to a cabaret club.]

Nakajima: One o' my taxi buddies said this Olivier place'll fix ya up a real hootin' time. 

Kiryu: This is... 

Nakajima: Hm? Somethin' wrong? Y'know it, Suzuki-san? 

Kiryu: Er, no…

Attendant: (bows) Will it be just the two of you tonight? 

Nakajima: Yep! Set me up with the most breathtakin' gal ya got on staff! I want yer number one! 

Attendant: You’ll be requesting her, then, sir? There's an additional charge for that. 

Nakajima: And I ain't gonna pay it! Free’ll do! Come on, show us the prettiest girl y'got!

Attendant: Sir.

Kiryu: Sorry about him. I'll cover the request fee. We’ll take your number one. 

Attendant: Very well. In that case, right this way, gentlemen. 

[They enter the hall and sit down at a table. The place looks expensive and luxurious. Nakajima, already quite drunk, wipes his sweaty face with a towel. A short young woman in an expensive pink dress and professional makeup enters.]

Hostess: Hi there! I’m Momo!

Nakajima: (mumbling) The heck? This is the cutest girl here? Thought I asked fer your number one!

Momo: (sits down) Don't gimme that lip. I get folks linin' up for me every day of the week!

[A tall girl in a red dress and minimal makeup approaches them. She has long, straight red hair. Nakajima is struck by her beauty. She also looks a bit like Yasuko, Saejima's sister...]

Hostess: Good evening. I'm Mayumi.

Nakajima: Now there's a number one. Freakin' gorgeous...

Mayumi: (sits down) Don't tease me like that. I'm long past my prime.

Nakajima: Like heck y'are! C'mon, Suzuki-san. Ain't this girl top-shelf?

Kiryu: Yeah, I guess so.

[He answers reluctantly and sinks into unhappy thoughts. At that moment some jerk sprawled out on the couch, smashing his foot on the table.]

Drunk Jerk 1: Ugh, who do those Tojo pricks think they are!? Makes me wanna hurl!

Drunk Jerk 2: Hey! Y bringin' us another bottle or what!?

Nakajima: Those guys're sure kickin' up a storm. Who are they, anyways?

Momo: Oh, them? They're our protection.

Nakajima: Protection? Y'mean yakuza?

Momo: Yup. Small-timers, though. Just 'bout the bottom rung of the Yamagasa ladder.

Nakajima: Why they gotta come boozin' here? It ain't protection if they're only showin' up when there's not a speck o' trouble.

Momo: Parently these're special circumstances. Some group from Tokyo in town. Think they're called the Tojo Clan? They're all over Nagasu right now. If yer askin' me, I'd bet those guys're here to keep any of them Tojo folks out.

Nakajima: All clean over my head, but it stinks o' trouble. Just wish they stayed away on payday. Right, Suzuki-san?

Kiryu: Yeah, I guess.

Momo: It's a real crick in the neck. Them hangin' here on payday's gonna scare all outis customers off. Not to mention they're sloshed outta their minds. Bunch o’ dang pests.

Drunk Jerk 1: Why we gotta sit around in this dump? Y'wanna deal with the Tojo? I say we knock 'em -- clean on their asses n' right outta Fukuoka!

Drunk Jerk 2: Guess the main family doesn't wanna ruffle any feathers. 

Drunk Jerk 1: Equal alliance my ass. We sign up for that shit, those Tojo fucksöll, still treat us like somethin' they stepped in! The main family jus' don't get it.

Drunk Jerk 2: Got that right. Then there's their chairman. Some jackoff called Daigo Dojima.Rumor has it guy's only 36.

Drunk Jerk 1: 36!? That's younger'n me!

Drunk Jerk 2: Parently he only got the gig 'cause of his daddy. Read it in the Weekly Jitsuwa.

Drunk Jerk 1: So then we're gonna be takin' orders from some little brat who still pisses the bed? Fuck that! I ain't standin' for it!

[He sips from his glass but there’s nothing in it. Then he grabs a bottle of beer…]

Drunk Jerk 1: Empty? Great service ya got. Hey, we're dry over here! Get us a new bottle, n' make it snappy!

Waiter: Coming right up, sir. Here you are, sir. Apologies for the wait.

[He kneels and offers the jerk a bottle of wine, clearly expensive one.]

Drunk Jerk 1: Too fuckin' slow!

[He slaps the waiter. Nakajima quickly finishes his drink.]

Momo: Sir?

Nakajima: Enough's enough! I'm tossin' those punks out!

Kiryu: Chief.

Nakajima: It's all good, all good! Just sit back n' watch! Hey, you over there! Pipe down! Yer ruinin' the vibe! Y'gotta be more considerate of how other customers feel when you're drinkin'!

[Drunk Jerk 1 knocks him out with just one punch in the face.]

Drunk Jerk 1: Drunk fool. Y’think you can just run your mouth at us like that!? (laughs)

[Kiryu approaches.]

Kiryu: You're pretty quick to attack a civilian. I guess the Yamagasa Family doesn't offer etiquette classes.

[The jerks stand up and their girls leave.]

Drunk Jerk 1: Say what? And who the shit're you!?

Kiryu: Right. It's no surprise you don't know.

Drunk Jerk 1: N' I don't care, either!

Kiryu: Fair enough. That'll make this easier. Well? I'm ready when you are.

Drunk Jerk 1: The hell’re ya mumblin' about, man? Y'picked the wrong day to mess with us! Lucky for us, we were just thinkin' we could use a nice new punchin' bag. Hope yer ready to die!

[Kiryu fights the jerks from the Yamagasa Family. We learn that Jerk 1 is Mihara and Jerk 2 is Ishibashi, but who gives a damn - they lie on the floor pretty quickly. After the fight, Mayumi wipes Nakajima’s face with a towel (he’s still unconscious) and Kiryu apologizes to the owner.]

Kiryu: Sorry for all the trouble. (bows)

Owner: Please. We should be the ones apologizing. I'm not sure I should be saying this… But I'm glad you ran those Yamagasa thugs out of here. I doubt they'll show their faces in my club again

Kiryu: I hope you're right.

Nakajima: (wakes up) Huh? Where'd they go?

Kiryu: You don't remember? You really showed them who's boss, sir.

Nakajima: (shocked) I did!? (triumphs)

Kiryu: (to the owner) We'll be going now.

[They bow to each other. Kiryu and Nakajima walk outside.]

Nakajima: That was a real hoot, huh? Think I'll request that girl Mayumi-chan next time. 

Kiryu: Heh. 

Nakajima: Well, it's up and at 'em again in the mornin'! G'night! 

Kiryu: Get home safe, sir. (bows) 

[Nakajima leaves.]

Kiryu: (Well, tomorrow's another day. Time to head home.) 

[On the way home, Kiryu passes a young man we have already seen.]

Dashing Young Lad: So you finally showed. 

Kiryu: Hm? 

Dashing Young Lad: I saw you tear those guys a new one back there. Acting the hero, saving the girl... Pretty smooth, I must admit. 

Kiryu: Uh... Thanks. 

Dashing Young Lad: Hey, don't be like that. I mean it. Anyway, I didn't really see you around here much until, oh I don't know, six months ago? And you don't talk like a local, so... you're from out of town, right? 

Kiryu: Maybe.

Dashing Young Lad: Heh, you don't have to tell me if you don't want. Someone who's lived as long as you's gotta have a few things they'd rather keep to themself. Oh, right. Duh. I haven't introduced myself. The name's Sosuke Komaki. Sosuke the Exterminator. I rid the streets of whatever trash floats to the surface. Punks, thugs, hooligans—you name it. 

Kiryu: Komaki, huh? 

Sosuke: Please, just call me Sosuke. I've been watching you do your thing, and I gotta say, you move pretty quick for an old dude. I bet you were the real shit back in your prime. 

Kiryu: The... what? 

Sosuke: Like, you're on a whole 'nother level compared to the lameass bitches you see around town. Still got nothing on me, though. 

Kiryu: ...Do you need me for something, or can I go now? 

Sosuke: Come on, chill out a sec. You're an outsider, I'm an outsider. Folks like us oughta stick together, don't you think? Besides, your performance back there got me curious. I can't let you walk away just yet. 

Kiryu: Just cut to the chase already. What is it you want, exactly? 

Sosuke: Piqued your interest, did I? Good. Only thing is, we're in earshot of like, the entire city here. Mind if we take this somewhere private? 

[They go to a closed construction site.]

Sosuke: This'll do the trick. 

Kiryu: Well? What do you want from me? 

Sosuke: Straight to the point, just how I like it. Then I won't mince words. I wanna fight you. 

Kiryu: You what? 

Sosuke: I could tell you were holding back on the thugs in that club. If anything, you were just venting a bit. I know I'm right. As for what got you all wound up, no frickin' clue. One thing's for sure: you need an outlet for all that aggression. And no better way to let it all out than a good old-fashioned fistfight. Doesn’t have to be any more complicated than that. 

Kiryu: You're reading too much into it. Besides, I have no reason to fight you. 

Sosuke: You need a reason? Some “way of the warrior” shit right there. I like it! Hard to explain it all now, but we have more reason to fight than you realize. Vague, I know. But trust me. If that ain't enough, though... there's nothing stopping me from coming at you right here, right now. Need a better reason than that? Didn't think so. Now get ready, old man, 'cause here I come! 

[The fight begins!]

Sosuke: Don't go easy on me, okay? I wanna see what you're really made of. You've got a lot of pent-up aggression. Let's see if I can help you get it out. 

[Kiryu wins using his Dragon Spirit.]

Sosuke: Heh, so you do have some fight in you. 

Kiryu: Satisfied? I have better things to be doing right now. 

Sosuke: C'mon, I couldn't be satisfied after that. I was barely even trying! 

Kiryu: Yeah, that's what everyone says after they get laid out. 

Sosuke: C'mon, old man. You must've felt it. Neither of us were giving it our all, and you damn well know it.

Kiryu: (He sure is pushy.)

Sosuke: You've been outta the game a while, old man. I could scrape the rust off of you with a knife. Unless you fix that, you're gonna have a rough road ahead. So why don't I give you some pointers, help you brush up? I'll have you back in tip-top shape in no time flat. All I want in return is the fight of a lifetime. Once you're back in your prime, mean. Well? 

Kiryu: You think I'd accept help from someone who just attacked me for no reason?

Sosuke: Hey, there was a reason. Soon as you gimme the fight I want, I'll spill. I’ve got nothing to hide. You've just gotta earn it first. 

Kiryu: You're a real pain in the neck, you know that?

Sosuke: I'll take that as a compliment. Anyway, you know where to find me. Come back when you wanna tango.  

Kiryu: ...If I feel like it. 

[They leave the site. Sosuke shows Kiryu a map.]

Sosuke: I spend my time hanging around right here, so stop by when you get a chance. If you don't see me, I'm probably off somewhere grabbing a bite. 

Kiryu: Fine. But for now, I'm going home. I'll humor you some other time. 

Sosuke: I'll be waiting. See ya! 

Kiryu: (Not happy about being out this late. I should really get home.)

Head Straight Home ✓
Take a Look Around 

Kiryu: (All right, I’m out of here.) 

[He goes home.]

Kiryu: (Phew, another long day. Should probably get some sleep.) 

Go to Bed ✓
Not Yet 

Kiryu: (Need to be fresh for tomorrow.)

[While the kettle is boiling, Kiryu smokes, sitting on the floor and pondering. He recalls a recent conversation with Daigo.]

Daigo: (in Kiryu’s head) It may not always seem it… But I'm trying my best to walk this path. Fourth Chairman.

[The kettle, meanwhile, is boiling. A girl enters the apartment.]

Girl: I’m home. 

[She turns the overboiling kettle off.]

Girl: You left the kettle on!

[It’s Mayumi!]

Mayumi: Hey, you.

Kiryu: Hey. Welcome home.

Chapter 2: UNINVITED GUEST
[Kiryu wakes up in the morning. Mayumi is already up and cooking.]

Mayumi: Morning, sleepyhead. Breakfast's almost ready. Just a minute.

[They have breakfast and talk at the small table sitting on the floor.]

Mayumi: Oh yeah, I washed your work shirt for you, so there's a fresh one ready for you to wear. 

Kiryu: I keep telling you, you don't have to do that. 

Mayumi: What's the harm in helping out around the house? 

Kiryu: I can take care of myself. I don't need to be mothered. 

Mayumi: Come on, lighten up a little. 

Kiryu: You’ve been staying over every day lately. You should go back home once in a while.

Mayumi: I don't mind. By the way, I noticed your boss wgs pretty drunk last night. 

Kiryu: Yeah. When you're still-single at his age, I imagine it gets pretty lonely. 

Mayumi: He's single? I could’ve sworn he was married. 

Kiryu: Why?

Mayumi: There's an imprint on his left ring finger. 

Kiryu: An imprint? 

Mayumi: Yeah. You'd have to have a band on for decades to leave a mark like that. 

Kiryu: I hadn't noticed. 

Mayumi: (soft laugh) I didn't think you would. 

[Kiryu stands up. He starts to dress up and takes off his gray hoodie, revealing a tattoo of a dragon.]

Mayumi: Will you be home late again tonight?

Kiryu: Yeah. I'm on the midnight shift. Maybe you should stay at your own place for a change. I want to be alone tonight.

Mayumi: Oh, come on. I can tell you're happier when I'm around, Suzuki-san.

Kiryu: I don't know what you mean.

Mayumi: Your tie's crooked. There. All better. 

[Kiryu walks towards the door and notices a photo frame facing the wall.]

Mayumi: What's wrong?

Kiryu: It's nothing. I should go.

Mayumi: Have a good day!

[Kiryu leaves the apartment.]

Kiryu: (Time to go to work.)

Head For Nagasu Taxi
[On the way to work, Kiryu hears a whine from a dog.]

Dog: Yowl!

[The whine comes from the public toilet on the embankment.]

Kiryu: (Was that a dog?)

[He goes behind the toilet and sees three scumbags bullying a dog.] 

Degenerate Washout: Okay, me next! I’ll hit it for sure this time! Just you watch! 

[The dog lies on the ground and seems unconscious. A girl runs in.]

Brave Girl: Stop it! Don't you bully Chiro anymore!

Apathetic Burnout: Who's this kid? Is her dog? 

Degenerate Washout: Who cares? Hey, kid! You better scoot, or well throw rocks at you next! 

Wannabe Dropout: Heh, yeah! Show no mercy! That's how we dropouts do it! Screw the rules! Annihilate everything! 

[He throws a rock.]

Brave Girl: Oh no!

[She closes her eyes and when she opens it she sees Kiryu in front of her.]

Degenerate Washout: Huh? Who's this old prick? You lost on your way to the bingo game? 

Kiryu: Funny... I feel like this isn't the first time seeing this. 

Degenerate Washout: And now he's babbling on like a senile old fool. He's losing it! 

Brave Girl: Hey, mister? You're not... one of them, are you? 

Kiryu: Not even close. Just stand back and you'll see. You there. Does it make you feel strong to pick on the weak and defenseless? It's a shame I have to say this, but guess every town has its fair share of losers. 

Degenerate Washout: Shut your face! You shoulda never messed with us in the first place! Boys, cripple this sonuvabitch! 

[Kiryu paints the ground with their blood.]

Degenerate Washout: Dude. We are so, so sorry! Please don't hurt us anymore! 

[Kiryu got a pack of 1-2-3 Gum.]

Brave Girl: Um... Thanks, mister! 

Kiryu: Don't mention it. They didn't hurt you, did they? If you'd like, I can take you home. 

Brave Girl: Actually, I ran away... I had a fight with my dad. 

Kiryu: A kind girl like you really ran away from home?

Brave Girl: Yeah... My dad’s probably still angry with me. So I don't want to go back right now. 

Kiryu: That's your name? 

Brave Girl: ...It's Haruka. Haruka Shinohara. 

Kiryu: Haruka!? Interesting... Even your name is the same. 

Haruka: The same as who? 

[Kiryu tells her his story.]

Haruka: So you and this Haruka-chan live apart now?

Kiryu: Yeah... I'm not sure I'll ever see her again.

Haruka: Why not? Can't you just go and visit?  

Kiryu: It’s a bit more complicated than that. As much as I want to be in her life... I know I’m only being selfish. Besides, I think I’ve done all I can for her as a father. This is probably for the best. 

Haruka: ……

Kiryu: How about you? Why'd you run away? 

Haruka: Here's the thing. I'm not actually related to my dad, either. 

Kiryu: Huh?

Haruka: I guess that's another thing I've got in common with your Haruka-chan. Strange, isn't it? 

Kiryu: ……

Haruka: My real dad died a long time ago. And normally, my stepdad's really nice... but he gets super angry these days. Something about work not going well. I don't know the details. Anyway, he blew up at me for some reason, and I told him to his face, “My real dad would never yell at me!” Then I left the house…

Kiryu: ……

Haruka: When I mentioned having a real dad, my stepdad got this really sad look on his face... He just kept staring at me, like he'd been hit in the head or something. That’s when I knew I'd hurt his feelings real bad. I guess that's why he didn't come running after me. *sniffle* I bet Mom and Dad are glad I'm not around to cause trouble anymore... So... So now... I've got nowhere to go home! *sob* 

Kiryu: Where do you live, Haruka? I'll go get your dad to come pick you up. 

Haruka: But I don't think he... *sigh* 

Kiryu: Your dad was probably just caught off guard. There's no way he'd be happy you're gone. I'm sure of it. It's also a dad's job to bring his kids home when they run away. You just need to wait for him. 

Haruka: ……

Kiryu: Where's your dad right now? 

Haruka: Probably at Café Portugal, working with Mom. We actually live in that building. 

Kiryu: Café Portugal? Okay. I'll be back with your dad soon. Just hang tight for a bit. 

[He walks briskly toward the cafe.]

Kiryu: Excuse me. This is Café Portugal, right? Are you Haruka's father?

Haruka's Father: You've seen my daughter! She ran off and hasn't come home!

Kiryu: I know. I actually saw her not too long ago. I can take you to where she is, if you'd like.

Haruka's Father: Of course! Lead the way!

[They come to the embankment, however...]

Haruka's Father: Is this the place? Where's my daughter?

Kiryu: She should be here…

Haruka's Father: I don't see her anywhere! What's the meaning of this!?

Degenerate Washout: Over here, you old farts!

[As it turned out, the degenerates who abused the dog took Haruka as a hostage to get revenge on Kiryu.]

Haruka: Dad!

Father: Haruka? What's going on here?

Kiryu: It's those guys that were tormenting that puppy. Looks like they're back with reinforcements.

Degenerate Washout: You may think you're tough, but we have strength in numbers now. You don't stand a chance! You'll be dead as a' doornail by the time we're finished with you!

Kiryu: (to Haruka’s father) You stay back. I can take these guys.

Haruka's Father: I can't let you do this alone. They've taken my daughter hostage. What kind of father could just stand here and watch!?

Kiryu: All right. Then let's take them on together. Time to give these brats a lesson in humility!

[Together they kick asses of that sorry excuse for a gang.]

Degenerate Washout: Ugh... How'd we let these geezers get the best of us?

Haruka's Father: Haha… *pant* You really pack a punch there, sir. *pant*

Kiryu: You didn't do so bad yourself. Look, your daughter's waiting.

Haruka: Dad... Did you come here to get me?

Haruka's Father: Of course I did. I was worried about you... I was nearly going crazy not knowing where you were.

Haruka: Look, Dad... I'm sorry I said those things about wishing my biological dad was around. It was a terrible thing to say.

Haruka's Father: Don't worry. I don't expect you to forget about him just because I'm around. And, I'm sorry I got frustrated and yelled at you. I promise I won't do that again. All I care about is that you come home safe... with me and your mom.

Haruka: Okay... Let's go home, Dad!

Kiryu: So you're good now, Haruka?

[She nods and Kiryu walks away.]

Haruka's Father: Hey, wait up! I haven't had a chance to thank you properly. I know it's not much, but here, take this.

Haruka: Thanks, mister. I hope you can go see your Haruka-chan sometime. I bet she misses you, too.

Kiryu: Huh?

Haruka: Like you said, isn't it a dad's job to bring their kids back home when they run away?

Kiryu: …You’re right. (Not that it was Haruka who ran away.)

[Kiryu runs to his work as he is already late. Near the taxi depot, two men run up to him...]

Persistent Thug: Hey! There's the asshole! 

Sleazy Jerk: Finally tracked yer ugly face down!

Kiryu: Who are you again? 

Persistent Thug: Don't pretend like y’don't know. We're here t’settle the score! 

Kiryu: ...Seriously, I have no idea who you are. 

Sleazy Jerk: Y'do and goddamn know it! Now strap in, it's time we pay ya back double for what ya did to us yesterday! 

Kiryu: Oh, you're those punks I had to teach a lesson. Guess class is back in session. 

Persistent Thug: Not today, pal! No way yer gettin' one over on us... Not with the backup we got in store for ya! 

Kiryu: So you brought someone else to finish a job you couldn't. Guess you're not just a creep, but a coward, too. 

Persistent Thug: Yeah, yeah, keep talkin'. We'll wipe that dumb smirk off yer face soon enough. C'mon out here, Nagata-san!

[A military type man approaches. He’s wearing a strange outfit  covered with various words like golden 極悪非道 (inhuman; heinous; atrocious) on his leg.]

Nagata: This yer man?

Persistent Thug: Mmmhm.

Sleazy Jerk: Hehehe, hope y'already wrote yer will, wrinkle-ass. 'Cause Nagata-san here's a member of the legendary Nagasu Devil Killers! 

Persistent Thug: Think yer tough? Wait 'til Nagata-san here gets his paws on ya. Yer gonna look at smears on the ground and wish that was you! 

Kiryu: The Nagasu Devil Killers? Sorry, never heard of them. 

Persistent Thug: (shocked) Y’what!?

Kiryu: Look, can we just get this over with so I can go to work in peace? You're going to make me late. 

Nagata: Oh? Y’work at Nagasu Taxi then? 

Kiryu: That's none of your business.

Nagata: Heh. You boys were right, this guy's got a real attitude problem. Now how bout we give him a new perspective... from a hospital bed! 

[Kiryu deals with the jerks in a matter of seconds. Apparently the “devil killer” is just a fancy word for “big mouth”.]

Nagata: Ugh…

Kiryu: Get it now? All this tough guy business is only going to get you hurt.

Nagata: Why you... This ain't over yet! Yer gonna regret the day y'messed with the Devil Killers! 

[He runs away.]

Sleazy Jerk: Hey! Hold up, Aniki! 

Kiryu: (The Devil Killers, huh? They don't seem so tough. Well, I should really be getting to work.) 

[He enters the office.]

Nakajima: Man, my noggin' is killin' me. Kinda strange, though. It feels less like a hangover and more like I got smacked across the face. Did I take a tumble last night or somethin’? 

Kiryu: No, but you should get that looked at just in case. 

Nakajima: Eh, I'll live. This skull here's hard as granite. Now! Do me proud out there today, 'kay? Give Hirakawa-san over there a holler. Pretty sure we got some calls in. 

Kiryu: I'm on it. 

[He goes to Hirakawa-san, the accountant.]

Hirakawa: Oh, Suzuki-san. Good morning.

Kiryu: Morning.

Hirakawa: You went to see Tenjin Transportation yesterday, right? They sent us something today, to “show their appreciation” for what you brought them. ...Did you do something to tick their president off, Suzuki-san? 

Kiryu: No, I don't think so. 

Hirakawa: It’s just… the gift they sent... 

Kiryu: What, is there something wrong with it? 

Hirakawa: Well, just take a look.

[Kiryu got some Milk.]

Kiryu: …Huh.

Hirakawa: It's almost like they sent it as some kind of retaliation. 

Kiryu: (I guess my gift didn't exactly impress.) 

Hirakawa: I know their president is a difficult person, but you can't go getting on his bad side at a time like this. 

Kiryu: Sorry. (bows)

Hirakawa: Well, just be sure you treat your passengers good today.

Kiryu: (I guess I’d better head out for the day.)  

Friendly Voice: On your way out, Suzuki-kun? 

Kiryu: Oh, Wada-san. Yeah, I was thinking of doing a few loops around Nagasu. 

Wada: Well ain't that just the most perfect timing. Mind if I bum a ride off ya? My place is a bit of a hike from here, so I’d be real appreciative if ya just dropped me off on the way. 

Kiryu: Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. 

Wada: Great! You're a lifesaver. 

Muramatsu: Wada-san. You know you shouldn't be using our taxis for your own personal gain.

Wada: Seriously, Muramatsu-kun?  

Muramatsu: Yeah, seriously. You're the most senior driver here, so you need to set the example. 

Wada: Man. Way to call me out.

Nakajima: Ah. cut the guy some slack, Muramatsu-kun. Ain't a big deal, as long as it's not every day. Suzuki-san, y'don't mind takin' Wada-chan along, do ya? And Wada-chan, as long as you're gettin' a free lift, fright wanna give Suzuki-san here some advice. Yer our top driver, so y'gotta show the new blood how it's done. 

Wada: Be glad to, Chief. 

Kiryu: Let's hit the road, then. 

[Near the car…]

Kiryu: Let's get going, then. 

Wada: Yeah. Oh, Nakajima-san wanted me t'give ya a few driving tips while we're at it. Bet I'm the last guy ya wanna hear advice from, but just indulge an old man. 

Kiryu: Not at all. I appreciate it. 

Wada: All right, off we go! 

[You are allowed to drive the car. Kiryu drives Wada home.]

Wada: First, there's a knack to using the accelerator. Could be a red light. Careful with the brakes. I’m sure you already know this, but you really gotta indicate when you're turning. You all settled in at work now? 

Still getting the hang of things.
I have no idea what I’m doing.
I've learned the ropes.

Wada: Hey, don't ignore the question! Enjoying taxi driving?

It's still a bit difficult. 
I'm having a really hard time. 
Yes, things are going well. ✓

Kiryu: Yes, things are going well. 

Wada: Yeah? Guess you're made for the job, Suzuki-san. 

[Kiryu brings Wada to his destination.]

Wada: Thanks. Y'really saved my skin there. 

Kiryu: My pleasure. Your advice was very helpful. 

Wada: I'm glad. If there's ever anythin' else I can help with, just say the word. Good luckøout there. 

Kiryu: (bows) See you around.

[Wada leaves. A passenger approaches Kiryu.]

Passenger: Oh, there's a taxi. You taking passengers?

Kiryu: Sure, get in.

[Kiryu drives the passenger on his own, without giving us the opportunity to control his car. The passenger tries to start a conversation.]

Passenger: Nice day out, huh?

Kiryu: It is.

Passenger: Sure's been awful cold out lately. Every year the fall gets shorter and the winter gets longer, am I right?

Kiryu: ……

Passenger: Don't you think so, driver?

Kiryu: I guess.

Passenger: You're pretty quiet for a cabbie.

Kiryu: ……

Passenger: ……

Kiryu: ……

Passenger: Hey, driver. There's only so much silence I can take. How long've you been at this job?

Kiryu: Only around six months.

Passenger: Oh, okay. That explains it.

Kiryu: (What's he talking about?)

Passenger: Let me put it to you like this. I don't know about other parts, but here in Fukuoka, taxi drivers are expected to keep up the conversation. Most of us locals here in Fukuoka like to chat. If you don't have the gift of gab, you're not gonna get any regular customers.

Kiryu: I see... My boss told me the same thing, come to think of it.

Passenger: I bet he did. Taxi driving's a service job, and small talk's a big part of the service.

Kiryu: Right, but I don't know what to talk about…

Passenger: Then how about I give you some pointers?

Kiryu: Such as?

Passenger: Well, I thought we'd do some practice dialogue, help get you started. I'm not speaking the Hakata dialect, so it should be easy to follow. Sound good?

Kiryu: Okay.

Passenger: So, how's business today?

Kiryu: ……

Passenger: I'm asking you, driver.

Kiryu: Oh, sorry. Let's see…

Business is pretty good. ✓
Business is bad. 
None of your damn business.

Kiryu: Business is pretty good. It helps when I get passengers like you who are going on longer trips.

Passenger: There you go. That's how it's done.

Kiryu: Okay. I think I'm getting the hang of this.

Passenger: So, have you gotten the hang of the job yet?

Kiryu: No, I still have plenty to learn.

Passenger: Yeah, I imagine it takes time.

Kiryu: What sort of work do you do?

Passenger: Me? I'm more of a glorified security guard than anything... Never mind that, though. Different subject.

Kiryu: Sure.

Passenger: What's your favorite Hakata food so far?

I'd have to say mizutaki. ✓
I'd have to say ramen. 
Takoyaki all the way.

{Mizutaki is a Japanese Chicken Hot Pot in which chicken, assorted vegetables, mushrooms, and tofu are cooked in a light kombu dashi broth.}

Kiryu: Well, I tried mizutaki the other day, and it was delicious.

Passenger: Yeah, it's pretty tasty, isn't it? Goes well with sake, so it's perfect for those who like their drink. You a big drinker?

Kiryu: Oh, I'll have a drink every now and then.

Passenger: Oh, hey, you know what you should try next? Gameni.

Kiryu: Gameni...? Never heard of that one. Is it any good?

Passenger: Why sure. You might hear some people call it chikuzenni. Anyway, it's a chicken and vegetable stew. We always have it at New Year's—

[Someone crashes into the taxi from behind.]

Passenger: Augh!

Kiryu: Damn!

Passenger: What happened!?

Kiryu: The car behind us sped up all of a sudden and tried to run us off the road. Are you all right, sir?

Passenger: I'm fine. But that car... It looks like they're one of the Devil Killers!

Kiryu: Devil Killers?

Passenger: Street racers who cause nothing but trouble. They challenge people on the road and shake them down for money if they lose. Happened to a lot of people already.

Kiryu: (That punk from earlier said he was with the Devil Killers, now that I think back on it. I didn't realize they were this much of a menace.)

Passenger: Now they've decided to pick on a local taxi? Bunch of goddamn lunatics… You know what, though. A professional driver like you should be more than capable of handling them. Go ahead and take them on.

Kiryu: I don't know if that's a good idea…

Passenger: I didn't tell you, but I'm actually with the motor patrol unit of the Fukuoka Police.

Kiryu: What? You're an officer?

Passenger: Yeah, and not the kind who sits back on his ass while a bunch of little shits pretend like they own the road.

Kiryu: ……

Passenger: Driver, you have my permission. We need to take a stand against these reckless criminals if we want to keep the streets safe for our citizens!

Kiryu: I can't guarantee this will turn out how you want… but I might as well give it a shot.

Passenger: Great! Let's burn some rubber!

Kiryu: Here goes nothing.

[Kiryu defeats the driver of the car that hit him, Nagata, in an epic street racing race. Later, he and his passenger meet Nagata at a gas station.]

Nagata: Man, I don't believe this shit.. Got my ass whooped by a taxi driver!

Kiryu: Hey, I remember you.

Nagata: Oh geez! It's that muscle-bound freak again! All right, you. Mark my words! You're gonna wish you never made an enemy of the Devil Killers! (running away) You hear that, asshole!? Y’fucked up real good this time!

Passenger: Get back here! Damn... You know that guy?

Kiryu: Not really. He picked a fight with me on the street a while back.

Passenger: No kiddin'? That was no ordinary driving there, though. Were you ever a street racer yourself?

Kiryu: No.

Passenger: Heheh. Just pulling your leg. Well, sorry for all the trouble. Let me treat you to a nice meal?

Kiryu: You don't have to do that.

Passenger: Oh, come on. You've got to let me pay you back somehow. Besides, there's something I want to ask you about.

Kiryu: What is it?

Passenger: I’ll tell you while we're eating. How's that sound?

Kiryu: ...I suppose that's fine.

[In a sushi bar.]

Passenger: This here's one of my favorite spots. Go ahead n' help yourself.

Kiryu: Thanks. Don't mind if I do.

Passenger: So... if you'll allow me a word, I wanted t’apologize for getting ya involved.

Kiryu: You said those guys were called the Devil Killers?

Passenger: Yeah. The Nagasu Devil Killers. Pretty much got the run of this place. Way back they used to focus more on racing, but now they're just a typical gang. getting up to all sorts of mischief.

Kiryu: I see.

Passenger: But this has turned into something else. I can tell they want to bring ya down bad. Guys like them won't let up once they got you in their sights. Y’can count on them challenging you again.

Kiryu: If that's the case, what do you suggest I do?

Passenger: Honestly... I wanna see ya leave 'em all sucking exhaust fumes. Every time they challenge you, crush ‘em.

Kiryu: Are you serious?

Passenger: Dead serious. I've seen what y'can do, and I know ya got a shot at this, no matter what ya think.

Kiryu: (He's crazy...)

Passenger: Speed is everything to these punks, No matter how hard we crack down on 'em, they keep comin' back. They live for the thrill of winning. Only way to stop 'em is to humiliate 'em at what they hold sacred. Win, and they'll scatter like roaches. Much as I'd like to, I can't go head-to-head with these punks in a cop car. It'd only tarnish the badge. So we need someone pickin' up the gauntlet on our behalf.

Kiryu: And that's where I come in?

Passenger: Yer the only one I know at this point who can do it. Given the opportunity, I reckon y'could bring the entire squad to their knees. Whaddya say? We can't just let these vigilantes keep running rampant!

Kiryu: I don't know…

Passenger: They've been causin' absolute chaos these last few months. Things are goin' from bad to worse. They used to only go after other street racers, but now it seems anyone's fair game. Families, the elderly… Even other taxi drivers like you have been running afoul of 'em.

Kiryu: Taxi drivers too?

Passenger: Yeah. If we let 'em have their way, it could be someone y'know who gets hit next.

Kiryu: (He has a point.)

Passenger: (strictly) C'mon, man! I've said my piece. I don't wanna let them cause any more trouble!

Kiryu: (I can't let that happen...) Okay.

Passenger: Y'mean it?

Kiryu: Yeah. I’ll do whatever I can.

Passenger: (cheerfully) Thanks! Then I'll be counting on you. Oh, and help yourself to seconds! Can't race on an empty stomach, ya know!

Kiryu: Right, thanks.

[He eats some sushi and they leave the bar.]

Passenger: (bows) Thanks for hearin' me out. I appreciate you steppin' up to help us.

Kiryu: No problem.

Passenger: Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell ya my name. I'm Furumichi, with the prefectural police. Good to meet ya. And you are?

Kiryu: Kir— I mean, Suzuki.

Furumichi: I’ll make sure the local police stay clear of your races. So go all out and get 'em, Suzuki-san!

Kiryu: (Great, now I'm racing the Devil Killers? What have I gotten myself into this time?)

[Kiryu returns to the office.]

Kiryu: I'm back.

Nakajima: Ah, Suzuki-san. Thanks for givin' Wada-san a ride. How'd it go today? Plenty of customers?

Kiryu: About that. I actually had a run-in with these guys called the Devil Killers.

Nakajima: Ergh!

Kiryu: What is it?

Nakajima: Huh? Oh, nothin'. Never mind.

Kiryu: (Okay…)

[One of the drivers, Muramatsu, approaches them.]

Muramatsu: The Devil Killers… They're one of those street racing gangs, right?

Kiryu: Yeah. They challenged me while I was on duty.

Muramatsu: An amateur like you!? They ought to stick to their own kind... Don't they have any pride as racers? Well, how'd it turn out?

Kiryu: I won.

Muramatsu: You beat the Devil Killers!?

Kiryu: Yeah. Turned out my passenger was a cop named Furumichi, and he asked me to take them all down. He said the only way to do that was to race them, so that's what I did.

Muramatsu: But that's insane…

Nakajima: …I’ll say. Now Suzuki-san, don't you fret over this. I'll see if I can get in touch with this Furumichi fella, too.

Kiryu: Sorry to drag you into this, Chief. I know you have better things to do with your time.

Nakajima: No need to be so humble about it! It ain't like you're the one goin' around wreakin' havoc on the streets. The Devil Killers… They're the problem here. ……

Kiryu: Something wrong?

Nakajima: Oh, no, nothing. I was just about to congratulate ya for a job well done. Now go and take a breather—you've earned it. Of course, if yer lookin' for more work, talk to Hirakawa-san. There's always plenty of calls to keep us scramblin' around.

Kiryu: Understood.

Nakajima: Great, then I'll leave you to it.

[On the way out, Kiryu is called by the taxi company accountant, Miss Hirakawa.]

Hirakawa: Oh, Suzuki-san. Can you come here for a minute?

Kiryu: Sure, what can I help you with?

Hirakawa: I know you just got back, but we have another pickup request. Nobody else is available right now, so I’d like you to handle it if you can.

Kiryu: Then leave it to me. I'd be happy to take care of it.

Hirakawa: Great, thank you. The client didn't seem to be in any sort of rush, so you could always take a break first. What works best for you?

I’ll go now. ✓
I'll go in a bit.

Kiryu: I think I'll head out now.

Hirakawa: Perfect. Let me tell you where you need to go…

[Kiryu meets the client at the car.]

Kiryu: Sorry to keep you waiting.

Passenger: No worries, sorry to drag you all the way out here. I can hardly tell my left from my right in this town.

Kiryu: You're fine.

Passenger: Oh, by the way, I'm Tatsuya. You know, the chef? Surely you've at least seen me on TV before?

Kiryu: Sorry, I don't watch much television.

Tatsuya: I can sympathize. Neither of our jobs allow much time for that. Say, you wouldn't happen to know of any good local restaurants, would you? Ideally a place that hasn't already been featured in commercials or magazines.

Kiryu: So you're here for the food, huh? (I’m not exactly sure what he's looking for... I could always take him to that mizutaki place the chief showed me.) Okay. I think I know a place.

Tatsuya: Then let's head right over!

[Kiryu drives Tatsuya to Hanamidori.]

Kiryu: This is the place.

Tatsuya: A mizutaki restaurant, hm? I like what they've done with the exterior. Okay, let's head on in!

Kiryu: Huh? Tm coming too?

Tatsuya: Of course! If it's not up to par, I’d at least want to have some nice company.

Kiryu: Uh-huh…

Staff: Welcome. Have you decided on your order?

Tatsuya: Let's see, what would you recommend?

Staff: I’d say our original mizutaki is what we're known for.

Tatsuya: Perfect. l have that, then.

Staff: Coming right up. Thank you for waiting. Here's your mizutaki, folks.

Tatsuya: Wow, it looks almost like a home-cooked meal. Well, without further ado!

[And he starts eating…]

Tatsuya: ……

Kiryu: ……

Tatsuya: It's incredible! This is beyond expectation! Something that could change a man's life! Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect. I know it's a local favorite, but I was worried it might end up tasting like every other stew that's out there. But this is on a whole new level. This chicken broth is fantastic. The flavors are all in harmony. I bet they work hard to get it like this. Mm, I'm just... blown away right now!

Staff: Oh, you are too kind! Our chef would love to hear that.

Tatsuya: Driver, I can't thank you enough for taking me here!

Kiryu: Oh, sure... Glad you're enjoying yourself.

[They leave the Hanamidori.]

Tatsuya: Ahh, that hit the spot. I'll say, you're quite the gourmet.

Kiryu: Not really. My meals are usually pretty basic.

Tatsuya: Oh really now? Then consider expanding your horizons! You see, there's a kind of magic to food—a power that brings laughter, joy, and happiness to the heart. As a chef, I've learned the most important ingredient you can add to your cooking is passion. Just a dash of it, and even a regular dish can burst alive with flavor and potency. Isn't that incredible?

Kiryu: I suppose…

Tatsuya: Hmm, I see I'm not getting through to you. Alas. Now, I do plan on exploring more of your local eateries, so please feel free to tag along. I’ll be glad to show you just how beneficial enjoying a meal can be. You just say the word.

Kiryu: Well... We'll talk about it.

Tatsuya: Then I look forward to our next culinary encounter! Until then! (walks away)

Kiryu: (Now that I'm done eating, I should get back to the office.)

[Kiryu pulls into the parking lot of his taxi company and gets out of the car and is greeted by two men. On the lapels of their jackets you can see the pins with the symbol of a criminal organization. The men though are quite polite. It is the same men Aoyama sent to follow Daigo.]

Mustachioed Man: Taichi Suzuki-san, yes?

[Kiryu answered with silence.]

Mustachioed Man: There's something we'd like to ask you. Can you spare a moment?

Kiryu: Sorry, but I'm busy. (walks away)

Mustachioed Man: I don't understand. Hasn't your shift ended?

Kiryu: As I'm sure you can see…

[He takes the dust brush out of the trunk and starts pretending to be busy.]

Kiryu: There's more to my work than just driving. Now if you'll excuse me.

[Burly Man rushes to talk to Kiryu more directly but Mustachioed Man stops him.]

Mustachioed Man: It'll only be a moment. Surely you can spare that. Kazuma Kiryu-san.

[Kiryu turns his attention to their pins. They have the character 车 on them. It is the Tojo Clan.]

Mustachioed Man: This may not be the best place to talk. Shall we take this somewhere else?

[Kiryu puts the dust brush away in the trunk and pulls out his trenchcoat. They go to the river. Kiryu takes out a cigarette and Mustachioed Man immediately holds out a lighted lighter to him. Kiryu quickly puts the cigarette away.]

Kiryu: So what do you want?

Mustachioed Man: As I'm sure you're already aware, my partner and I are here on behalf of the Tojo Clan. Chairman Dojima is in Fukuoka on official business. And we've been tasked with keeping him safe by the chief of headquarters, Aoyama. Head of his own family, and assistant to the chairman. My name is Morinaga. And this is my junior associate, Aizawa.

[Aizawa bows.]

Kiryu: Spare me the introductions. What did you drag me here to ask about?

Morinaga: Chairman Dojima's whereabouts.

Kiryu: His whereabouts?

Morinaga: Yes. You see, last night… The chairman met Patriarch Madarame of the Yamagasa Family in Nagasugai for alliance talks. The negotiations themselves proceeded unimpeded, but we lost track of the chairman directly after. At the end of the meeting, Chairman Dojima went off alone… And was last seen getting into a taxi. We attempted to follow him by car, but weren't familiar enough with the Fukuoka roads. In the end, we regrettably lost sight of the chairman's taxi. We cross-checked the taxi's license plate number with the Road Transport Bureau, though… And found the car was registered to a Nagasu Taxi Company. Not long after, we determined that the driver's name was Taichi Suzuki. But we have no reason to believe the chairman knew anyone by that name. It only seemed proper we came to meet this mysterious Taichi Suzuki-san. So we waited until you eventually showed your face. It did seem strange. The chairman intentionally chose a taxi in the middle of the queue. I didn't see what could compel him to do that. But I have an idea now. I'd never have imagined the driver was in fact, Kazuma Kiryu-san, fourth chairman of the Tojo Clan. I'm still in disbelief, to be honest.

Kiryu: You have the wrong guy.

Morinaga: Kiryu-san. Do you know where Chairman Dojima is or not?

Kiryu: I took a passenger on the highway, then dropped him off back near Nagasugai. That's all I've got for you.

Morinaga: Is that truly it?

Kiryu: Yeah.

[He wants to smoke, but all the cigarettes in his pack turn out to be crumpled.]

Kiryu: Now are we done here? I have a shift to get to.

Aizawa: So that's how it is, Kiryu-san? You'd really abandon Chairman Dojima without so much as batting an eye?

Kiryu: Excuse me?

Aizawa: You heard me. This is a pivotal moment for the Tojo Clan. That's why we've come to Fukuoka. The chairman vanishing at a time like this is no insignificant matter. There could have been an accident, or worse. And yet, you don't seem even the slightest bit concerned. (loudly) You'd hang the chairman out to dry like he was nothing to you!?

Morinaga: Aizawa!

Aizawa: I haven't been wearing the Tojo badge for all that long. Truth be told, all I know about you are the stories, Fourth Chairman. But it was the chairman who was always telling them. He said it was his duty to protect the Tojo Clan you left to him.

Morinaga: Aizawa.

Aizawa: The other execs don't want us having these talks with the Yamagasa Family. Say they're not even in the same league as the Tojo. How this equal alliance is anything but. But the chairman took it all in stride because of what he promised you. So please, Fourth Chairman. Tell us where the chairman was going that night.

Kiryu: I already told you, I don't know.

[He walks away. Aizawa stops him.]

Aizawa: How do you live with yourself? Chairman Dojima's supposed to be your friend!

Morinaga: Aizawa.

Aizawa: (angirly) I'm not sure why you're doing this, but I'm not letting you turn your back on him!

Morinaga: Aizawa!

Kiryu: Hands off. I said let me go!

[He pushes Aizawa and he falls to the ground.]

Morinaga: I get the picture. You're not Kazuma Kiryu. Just Taichi Suzuki-san. Is that what you're saying?

Kiryu: Exactly.

Aizawa: Aniki!

Morinaga: Understood. That makes things simpler. We'll just have to rough you up a bit.

Kiryu: You what?

Morinaga: If you really were the fourth chairman… We wouldn't lay a finger on you, regardless of the circumstances. But if you're nothing more than a simple taxi driver, that's another story. We will get the truth. Even if we have to beat it out of you.

Kiryu: You'd attack a civilian?

Morinaga: I'd prefer not to, of course. But desperate times... Well, they call for desperate measures. We're still yakuza. We're not above resorting to force. You should know that.

Kiryu: Fine then. If that's how it's gonna be, I'll just have to defend myself.

Morinaga: Hope you're ready. Here goes.

[Kiryu fights Yu Morinaga and Masato Aizawa. He has to fight hard to defeat the trained yakuza. A short time later, both yakuzas find themselves on the ground.]

Morinaga: You can't go, Fourth Chairman!

Kiryu: I've told you everything I know. And that's the truth. What you do now, well, that's up to you.

[He walks away.]

Kiryu: (...Might as well call it a day.)

[Someone calls him.]

Kiryu: Yes?

Hirakawa: Suzuki-san? This is Hirakawa. Can we talk?

Kiryu: Of course. What is it?

Hirakawa: I forgot to mention it this morning, but there's a program we're participating in. Our company has agreed to clean up trash as part of a local community effort.

Kiryu: Why, did we do something wrong?

Hirakawa: I don't think it's us personally, but some of the other drivers litter quite profusely. They’ll throw trash out the window on break, for example. That kind of behavior's a real problem. And if we do nothing to curb it, people will start thinking ill of our industry.

Kiryu: So we need to clean up our act and clean up the town, huh?

Hirakawa: Exactly. We should be perceived as model citizens here. I know it's extra work, but if you see any trash around town, would you mind picking it up? The chief is offering incentives to whoever goes above and beyond quota, so everyone's pitching in.

Kiryu: That's admirable of him. Then I'll lend my support.

Hirakawa: We'd all appreciate it. Now, are you done for the day?

Kiryu: Yes. I'm heading home now.

Hirakawa: Have a nice night, then. See you tomorrow.

[Kiryu returns to his small apartment. It’s empty now.]

Kiryu: (It's a little early, but should I go to bed?)

I should rest. ✓
I'll stay up a bit.

Kiryu: (Yeah, I should get some rest. I'm exhausted.)

Chapter 3: THE PLOT UNFOLDS
Early summer, 2011
Okinawa

[Morning Glory Orphanage. Kiryu walks out of the territory with a bag in his hand. He goes to the beach and sits next to Haruka, who grew quite a bit and wears a school sailor suit.]

Haruka: You’re really going, huh?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Haruka: But why? I already said I'm staying here with you.

Kiryu: You’ll be in high school next year. Taichi and Koji will graduate junior high the year after that. You don’t need me watching over you anymore. And don't assume I’m doing this for your sake. I'm just getting tired of all this babysitting.

Haruka: Lair. I can see it in your face.

Kiryu: Believe it. This is the best thing for me. You going into show business has nothing to do with it.

Haruka: I know there's more to it than that! You're lying through your teeth and I know it, Uncle Kaz. (thinks a minute) It's the money, isn't it? Park-san said she'd make sure we were taken care of. But only if you leave, right? Sorry. I know you're only lying for our sake. But that doesn't mean I don't deserve the truth.

[They sit together for a minute.]

Kiryu: Taichi is saying he wants to skip high school and just get a job. It's not only Taichi, Ayako and Koji, too. Now even Shiro is talking about finding work. They'd sacrifice their futures to help you and protect Morning Glory. They say they can hold things together until you're ready to come home.

Haruka: They'd do that for me?

Kiryu: Of course. You're their ray of hope. If you came back a star… Nothing would make them happier. I'm sure of it.

Haruka: Guys...

Kiryu: But they're too young to be throwing their lives away. We might be strapped for cash, but that's no reason to squander your chances. I won't let them do it.

Haruka: Still… they want you here with us more than anything. And I agree.

Kiryu: Thank you, Haruka. But... the timing's right. I always knew. We'd have to go our separate ways someday. So I'm going. Because I love you. And everyone else at Morning Glory.

Haruka: Uncle Kaz...

[The next morning, Kiryu looks at the upside-down picture on the drawer in the hallway and leaves the apartment.]

Head for Nagasi Taxi
Wada: That you, Suzuki-san?

Kiryu: Hey, Wada-san. How's everything?

Wada: Not good. I'm just sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Apparently nobody wants a ride today.

Kiryu: That's unfortunate.

[Someone hit Wada.]

Wada: Whoa! Was that a hit-and-run just now!? I didn't see it clearly, but…

Lady: Wait! Yuta! Bring back my Yuta!

Kiryu: What's wrong? Was anyone hurt!?

Lady: My boy… They carried off my little boy! He's in the car that just drove away!

Wada: What!?

Kiryu: You mean he was kidnapped? All right, I’ll go after them! I'm taking your taxi, Wada-san!

Wada: Okay!

Kiryu: You'd better come, too, ma’am!

Lady: (bows) Of course! Please, get my Yuta back safe!

[Kiryu chases the kidnappers and they meet at a parking lot. Thay have Yuta at the point of a gun.]

Kidnapper: You better not get in our way, asshole!

Mother: Yuta! Oh god…

Yuta: Mom! Help!

Kiryu: Let the kid go. You and I need to have a little talk.

Kidnapper: You think we're just gonna sit down and chat!? Nice fuckin' try! Now if you don't scram this instant, we're putting you in the ground!

Mother: Wait... Is that you, Itoda-san?

Kidnapper: What?

Kiryu: Do you know this guy?

Mother: I can't see his face, but I recognize that voice. I think he's a former employee of ours. My husband fired him the other day for embezzling company funds.

Kidnapper: But I gave the money back! And now I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. This was my only play!

Mother: Please, Itoda-san! Let Yuta go! I promise I won't tell the police!

Kidnapper: This isn't how I thought it'd go down... I went about it all wrong!

Kidnapper: I should have kidnapped the wife along with the kid! Look at all this extra bullshit I have to go through!

Mother: What…!?

Kidnapper: You're coming along for the ride, too, mystery man. I'm taking all your asses hostage! Now get over here! What? Don't give me that look. You want me to turn you into worm food!?

Kiryu: You really have no idea how much pain you're causing these people... Maybe I need to give youa taste of it firsthand.

Kidnapper: Yeah? Well, how bout I make you taste your own blood firsthand? Your corpse won't even look human by the time we're done with you!

[Kiryu beat the kidnappers up.]

Yuta: Mom! I was so scared…

Mother: (to Kiryu) Thank you so much! You aren't hurt, are you?

Kiryu: Don't worry about me. I'm just glad you two are okay. Now what should we do with these guys…

Mother: I’ve already called the police. They'll be here any moment.

Kidnapper: Oh, come on! Give us a break, lady! You got your kid back alive, didnt you!?

Kiryu: You're not getting off the hook that easy! Do you seriously think giving back the money and the kid makes up for what you did!?

Kidnapper: Well…

Kiryu: You need to wake up and realize you can't just do whatever you want, using your problems as an excuse. But I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that behind bars.

Kidnapper: Why you... Who the hell are you, anyway? You sure don't act like a taxi driver!

Kiryu: ……

Mother: I really appreciate what you've done. If it wasn't for you, who knows what would have happened to Yuta? I can't thank you enough.

Kiryu: Hey, don't worry about it. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.

Mother: There must be somethingI can do to express my gratitude. Here, this is the least I can give you.

[Kiryu got 20,000 yen {$160}.]

Mother: (bows) I’ll never forget the way you helped us today! I hope you know how wonderful you are…

Yuta: (bows) For real! You kicked some royal ass back there, sir!

[Kiryu returns to Wada.]

Kiryu: Thanks for letting me borrow your taxi today, Wada-san.

Wada: Don't mention it! That was a fine thing you did, Suzuki- san.

Kiryu: (bows) I'm sure anyone would've done it, had they been in my shoes. Anyway, I'll see you around. (walks away)

Wada: Now there goes a hell of a guy.

[Near the taxi station a guy shouts to Kiryu.]

Devil Killers Member: Hey! I know that face. You're that taxi driver. Suzuki, right? I hear you've been pickin' fights with us Devil Killers. Man, if I had the time I'd kick yer ass in a race right now! But I don't. Guess I'll just' have to kick yer ass the old-fashioned way!

[But things turn out to be exactly the opposite.]

Devil Killers Member: (picking up his teeth) Gah! You just won't go down. But I’ll get ya, you'll see!

[Kiryu enters the office.]

Hirakawa: Oh, Suzuki-san. Just who I wanted to see.

Kiryu: Good morning, Hirakawa-san. What can I do for you?

Hirakawa: We had an urgent pickup request come in. Would you be able to take care of it?

Sure. ✓
Sorry.

Kiryu: Sure, no problem.

Hirakawa: They're waiting at Nagasu Bridge. Drive safely.

[Kiryu meets his "clients."]

Yakuza-looking Thug: Hey, driver. I ordered a taxi here.

Kiryu: Right. Thank you for waiting. I'm from Nagasu Taxi.

Yakuza-looking Thug: Whatever. Let's roll.

Kiryu: (bows) Of course. Where to?

Yakuza-looking Thug: Hakata Station, on the double.

Kiryu: Understood.

[Kiryu drives the two thugs to the station.]

Yakuza-looking Thug: What a mess. They send us all the way to Fukuoka, then just when we're ‘bout to hit Nagasugai for some fun, we gotta bounce!

Thug's Underling: Think it was just an accident?

Yakuza-looking Thug: Who knows? Hey, can't ya go any faster!?

Agree ✓
Refuse

Kiryu: I’ll see what I can do.

Yakuza-looking Thug: You better.

Kiryu: You must be in a hurry. Did something happen?

Yakuza-looking Thug: One of our higher-ups just died in an accident. We gotta go back to Osaka for the funeral.

Kiryu: Is that the accident in Nagoya that was in the paper?

Yakuza-looking Thug: Yeah. And it wasn't just us, either. I hear a Tojo man bit the dust, too.

Kiryu: What? Did you just say the Tojo Clan, too?

Yakuza Thug: Didn't ya read the paper? There were two car crashes in Nagoya. Same day our man cashed in his chips, some Tojo guy kicked the bucket on some other road.

Thug's Underling: Seems too perfect to be coincidence.

Yakuza Thug: If you ask me, it's high time the seventh chairman named his damn Successor.

Thug's Underling: Is that even possible at this point? I thought he's got terminal cancer. He ain't even takin' visitors no more.

Yakuza Thug: There'll be trouble if the seventh chairman dies without namin' anyone.

Thug's Underling: Ya think some of us’ll be fightin' for the throne?

Yakuza Thug: That'd be just what the other side wants, idiot. If there ain't a successor, the eighth chairman gets chosen by consensus of all the patriarchs. In the end, the biggest faction wins out.

Thug's Underling: Ya mean the Watase Family. Ousaka Enterprises, or the Takachi Family?

Yakuza Thug: Yeah. Captain Watase is the vanguard of the Omi, with the biggest turf and the most soldiers. Whereas our chief of HQ rules Sotenbori, gaining influence through the massive tributes he pays. And with Patriarch Takachi out of their way, the throne could go to either of them.

Kiryu: (It'd be good to hear more about this. Maybe I should ask something.)

Ask About Takachi ✓
Stay Quiet

Kiryu: This gentleman who was killed—was he a prominent figure as well?

Yakuza Thug: Huh? Our boss Takachi? He was a clan lieutenant, but not really one of the key players. For some reason the seventh chairman had his back, though, so nobody messed with him. If Takachi-san had taken over as the next chairman, I guess we could've avoided a lot of trouble.

Kiryu: I see.

Thug's Underling: So there'll be a lotta money changin' hands to buy support from the patriarchs, huh?

Yakuza Thug: It ain't as simple as throwin' money around. Takin' the Omi leadership makes you top dog in the yakuza world. If ya want the spot, you're gonna have to do somethin' to prove you deserve it.

Thug's Underling: Yeah? Like what?

Yakuza Thug: Let's se... killin' a Tojo Clan big shot might work.

Thug's Underling: Ah! Like Sixth Chairman Dojima, or maybe his right-hand man Majima? If you could pull that off, it'd be a real show of strength for the Omi. That'd give ya more than enough clout to take the throne.

Yakuza Thug: Well, ain't like I was considerin' it, though.

Kiryu: (This is the perfect chance to dig for more info. They might even know about Daigo.)

Mention Daigo ✓
Don't Risk It

Kiryu: Now that you mention it, I hear the chairman of the Tojo Clan went missing here in Fukuoka.

Yakuza Thug: Say what!? You sure ‘bout that!?

Kiryu: Yes. Tojo Clan people have been searching for him all over since yesterday.

Yakuza Thu: No kiddin’. Guess my hunch wasn't too far off the mark, then.

Thug's Underling: Are ya sayin’... the Watase Family or Ousaka Enterprises kidnapped him?

Yakuza Thug: Could be. If I was gonna take a guess, that sorta move sounds more like Watase's style.

Kiryu: (Watase, huh...)

Yakuza Thug: Anyhow, all it is to us soldiers is more shit to worry about.

Thug's Underling: Ain't that the truth? Hope they hurry up and get it over with soon.

Yakuza Thug: Hey! We there yet?

Kiryu: Almost. Just a little bit farther.

Yakuza Thug: Man... We got stuck with a real slowpoke.

[He drops off passengers and ponders sitting in the car.]

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan... Daigo. I have nothing to do with them now.

[He returns to the office.]

Hirakawa: Welcome back, Suzuki-san. You've been gone for quite a while.

Kiryu: Well, I did have a long-distance passenger.

Hirakawa: Oh, lucky you. Then assume you're finished for the day? We still have some calls to take care of, so let me know if you're interested.

Kiryu: Will do.

Hirakawa: Oh, Suzuki-san. Remember that initiative I mentioned on the phone yesterday?

Kiryu: The trash thing?

Hirakawa: That's right. You see that bulletin board behind you? I’ll be posting how much trash everyone picks up there. You're up at the top. Check it out when you want to see how much you picked up.

Kiryu: Okay.

Hirakawa: Suzuki-san. I have some work for you. Let me see…

Kiryu: What's the job?

Hirakawa: Well, it's a pickup request, but I find it rather strange.

Kiryu: How so?

Hirakawa: Oh, just... Calling a taxi to pick you up from a highway rest area seems rather odd, don't you think? For instance, that's where those rowdy packs of motorheads are always hanging out. Please be careful out there.

Kiryu: (This is probably a challenge from the Devil Killers. I better keep my promise to Furumichi.)

Muramatsu: If you're going to face off with the Devil Killers, I suggest you think better of it.

Kiryu: Why is that?

Muramatsu: Well, its only dumb luck that a regular old driver like you managed to win. And that was one time. You let your ego run wild and you'll get in over your head. These guys don't mess around.

Kiryu: I appreciate your concern. But this is something I have to do for everyone's benefit, including yours.

Muramatsu: Hmph.

Hirakawa: Muramatsu-kun?

Muramatsu: Yes.

Hirakawa: Is this "DeVille Kellars" a foreigner or something? Everyone seems to be talking about him lately.

Muramatsu: ……

[Kiryu meets with Nagata at a gas station.]

Nagata: Been waitin' for you, taxi man!

Kiryu: I’m surprised you didn't turn tail and run, considering how badly you lost the other day.

Nagata: Hah! It ain't me you're up against. I got my aniki here to step up for me! And he's the roughest, toughest Devil Killer you ever saw! Tell him, Aniki!

Watanabe: So you're the cabbie who did a number on Nagata, huh?

Kiryu: What if I am? You here to avenge him?

Nagata: He sure is! Our aniki here, he would never let—

Watanabe: Shut up. This ain't about you, dumbass.

Nagata: It's not!? Then why…

Watanabe: I'm pissed that one of the mighty Devil Killers lost to some nobody who carts around passengers for a living! If the Four Kings got word of this, they'd blow a gasket.

Kiryu: The Four Kings?

Watanabe: Forget that shit! All you need to know is you're about to get beat to a pulp, all for the glory of the Devil Killers!

[Kiryu wins the race.]

Watanabe: Nah, this can't be real… I’m a Devil Killer and he's—he's just a cab driver!

Nagata: What happened, Aniki!? If the Four Kings find out about this, we're done for!

Watanabe: …Even so. We gotta tell 'em.

Nagata: But you can't! We'd be in deep shit for runnin' the Devil Killers name into the ground!

Watanabe: You little turd! Stop thinkin' of yourself over the honor of the team! We can't let this defeat stand! (to Kiryu) Yo. The Four Kings'll give you a personal demo of why no one messes with us. You'll see!

Kiryu: Who are these Four Kings you keep talking about?

Watanabe: You'll find out soon enough. You’ll wish you never crossed paths with real hardcore street racers like us!

Kiryu: (Looks like bringing down the Devil Killers is going to take a lot longer than I thought...)

[He returns to the office.]

Kiryu: I’m back. 

Hirakawa: Oh, hi there, Suzuki-san. Did you get along okay with that DeVille fellow?

Kiryu: I did. He might even be a regular customer now.

Hirakawa: Excellent to hear.

Muramatsu: Well? What happened?

Kiryu: Nothing much, I did wina race, though.

Muramatsu: Wait, you beat the Devil Killers again!? I don't believe what I'm hearing…

Kiryu: Muramatsu-san, could it be you're familiar with the street racing scene?

Muramatsu: No, that would be crazy… I just don't think you should be going around racing on public roads like that.

Kiryu: I can tell you I'm not enjoying it.

Muramatsu: Yeah right. Now look, I know you're older than me, but don't forget, I was here before you. So would it kill you to listen to your senpai sometimes? (walks away)

Kiryu: (I wonder what's bothering him so bad.)

Nakajima: ……

[Kiryu leaves the office. It’s evening outside, almost night.]

Kiryu: Hm?

[He notices Aizawa and Morinaga asking the passerby on the other side of the street.]

Aizawa: Hold on! We just want to ask a few questions!

Yamagasa Family Member: Yeah, right! I know what you Tojo snakes're up to! Yer tryin' to pin the fact that your chairman went missing on us, and use that as an excuse to steal our turf!

Aizawa: You want to say that again, asshole?

Morinaga: Aizawa! Calm down!

Aizawa: But Aniki!

Morinaga: Aggravating things with the Yamagasa helps nobody. (bows) You'll have to excuse my partner here. He's a bit quick to fly off the handle.

Aizawa: Aniki! You're just gonna let this guy walk after what he said!?

Yamagasa Family Member: Hmph, I knew somethin' like this would happen. Us regular ol’ Yamagasa boys were against this alliance from the get-go!

Aizawa: What?

Yamagasa Family Member: Look, pal. I dunno how y’run things up in Tokyo, but don't go thinkin' yer the star of the show here in Fukuoka!

Morinaga: Yes, we understand that, but is there any way you can let this slide? I assure you I’ll discipline my friend here accordingly for the way he's treated you.

Yamagasa Family Member: No way, you ain't gettin' off that easy! I'm gonna go report this right now! (walks away)

Morinaga: Ngh.

Aizawa: Hey, get back here!

Morinaga: Stop it, Aizawa. You've done more than enough already. Now come, we need to keep looking for the chairman.

Aizawa: …Fine.

[They leave.]

Kiryu: That guy really needs to learn how to control his temper.

[He goes home.]

Mayumi: Oh, welcome home.

Kiryu: You're here again?

Mayumi: Mhm. I had the early shift today.

Kiryu: Don't you have your own things to take care of? I’ll be fine by myself, really.

Mayumi: Here we go again. Do I really annoy you that much?

Kiryu: No, that's not it. In fact, I appreciate everything you do for me.

Mayumi: Then why do you push me away? Have you met someone else?

Kiryu: Of course not. You know that's not my style.

Mayumi: I don't get it, then. Why do you keep insisting I leave?

Kiryu: I don't see the problem. Isn't it weirder that we're practically living together without even being a couple?

Mayumi: In that case... why don't we become a couple? I'm ready and waiting, you know.

Kiryu: Sorry... but now's not the time.

Mayumi: Well, I guess I'll have to wait for a good time to come around, then.

Kiryu: Say, Mayumi?

Mayumi: Yeah?

Kiryu: Don't you have any family?

Mayumi: Where'd that come from?

Kiryu: I just realized you've never talked about them before.

Mayumi: Both my parents are long gone. I'm on my own.

Kiryu: I see... Sorry for prying.

Mayumi: Don't worry about it. Now, enough talk. Let's have some dinner.

Kiryu: Sure.

[He smokes after dinner. Mayumi's cooking. Someone knocks at the door.]

Mayumi: Just a second!

Kiryu: Hold on, Mayumi. Sit tight, I got it.

[He hears Mayumi’s gasp.]

Kiryu: What's wrong!?

[It’s Morinaga and Aizawa. They came covered in blood holding to each other. Mayumi covers her face in horror.]

Aizawa: You've got to help us, Kir—I mean, Suzuki-san!

Kiryu: How'd you find me here?

Aizawa: I can explain later. Right now, my aniki… Morinaga-aniki needs somewhere to rest!

Morinaga: Sorry for this. I told him not to impose on you, Suzuki-san...

[He falls on the floor.]

Aizawa: Aniki? Stay with me, Aniki!

[He and Kiryu walk outside, to the river.]

Aizawa: I never meant to intrude! But I couldn't take him to the hospital, and there was nowhere else to go. You were the only option I had.

Kiryu: How did you know where I live?

Aizawa: After we learned a "Taichi Suzuki" drove the last taxi the chairman got in, we got hold of the local real estate info and tracked you down. The only rental contract for a Taichi Suzuki here was your place, so it wasn't hard to find.

Kiryu: I see... Why didn't you come see me earlier, then?

Aizawa: Morinaga-aniki wanted to do things right. He says as representatives of the Tojo Clan, we can't be seen breaking code.

Kiryu: So that's why you came to wait for me after work.

Aizawa: Right. Morinaga-aniki does everything by the book, no matter what.

Kiryu: So what happened? That doesn't look like something you get from a regular brawl.

Aizawa: Some Yamagasa men got the drop on us.

Kiryu: They attacked you?

Aizawa: Ever since Chairman Dojima met Madarame, the Yamagasa Family patriarch, their men have been ambushing ours left and right. We're ten down already.

Kiryu: Why would they do that? I thought the alliance talks were going well.

Aizawa: That only goes for upper management. Their men on the street aren't too happy about the Tojo Clan being in Fukuoka.

Kiryu: Okay… But why come to me? Surely your fellow Tojo Clan members could help.

Aizawa: Not possible.

Kiryu: Why not?

Aizawa: We're the chairman's bodyguards. When he went missing, that fell on Morinaga-aniki. There's gonna be hell to pay, even if he shows up now. And if anyone found out Morinaga-aniki got bruised up by the Yamagasa on top of losing the chairman, he'd really be in for it.

Kiryu: But it isn't his fault he got ambushed.

Aizawa: That wouldn't matter to Patriarch Aoyama. He doesn't like excuses. And... he lets nothing go unpunished.

Kiryu: Yakuza families aren't like companies. He won't get far just by playing authoritarian.

Aizawa: I hear what you're saying. But it's a known fact that Patriarch Aoyama's discipline is what makes the Tojo Clan strong. He shows no mercy to members who betray us or violate an order. Even a big-name family dating back to the third chairman got axed after causing a scandal.

{This is a reference to Masaru Sera and Yakuza 0, which was not released at the time.}

Kiryu: ……

Aizawa: He's promoted lots of younger families that prove loyal and produce results instead. It might sound harsh, but everyone knows where they stand. The whole clan feels reinvigorated, and morale is high.

Kiryu: Reinvigorated, huh? I guess me and my brothers from back in the day have fallen behind the times.

[Meanwhile, at Kiryu's house, Morinaga was already laid out on a futon and his wounds were bandaged. He's resting. Mayumi hangs up his jacket and discreetly searches it. She finds a Tojo Clan badge.]

Mayumi: (reading) The Tojo Clan...

[Morinaga wakes up and sees what she’s doing. Someone enters the apartment. Mayumi quickly puts the badge back.]

Mayumi: Welcome home.

Kiryu: Yeah. Mayumi. Sorry, but you mind heading home for tonight? 

Mayumi: But…

Kiryu: These two work with an old friend of mine. We have a lot of catching up to do. Please.

Mayumi: …All right.

[She leaves.]

Kiryu: I get the situation. But I really have no idea where Daigo ran off to.

Morinaga: So, Fourth Chairman. You finally admit who you are.

Kiryu: Forget about my past. Shouldn't you be getting leads on Daigo right now?

Morinaga: Right. There's no sign of him going back to his hotel or getting in another taxi after he left yours.

Kiryu: Could he have gone into hiding somewhere?

Morinaga: There's no reason he would do that.

Kiryu: Then there's only one explanation.

Morinaga: Yes. I think we have to assume he was abducted.

Kiryu: Is the Yamagasa Family behind it?

Morinaga: It's possible. Their footsoldiers don't seem very pleased about the alliance.

Aizawa: I don't know. It just doesn't fit.

Morinaga: What doesn't?

Aizawa: We can speculate all we want, but Chairman Dojima was here as a guest of the Yamagasa Family, right? They might be willing to pick a fight with low-level suits like us, but abducting a guest of their patriarch? I don't buy it.

Kiryu: You have a point. I doubt any of the Yamagasa men would be that foolish.

Morinaga: Who could have done it, then?

[A phone rings.]

Morinaga: That's mine, Aizawa. Get it from my jacket for me.

Aizawa: Right away.

[He hands Morinaga his phone.]

Morinaga: This is Morinaga. Yes. Okay... Understood. What did you just say!? Okay, I’ll be right there. Yes. (hungs up)

Aizawa: What is it, Aniki?

Morinaga: Patriarch Aoyama is taking over as acting chairman.

Aizawa: Acting chairman? But Chairman Dojima's only been gone two days! Why would he do that?

Morinaga: I guess the execs are rushing to finalize the alliance with the Yamagasa Family.

Aizawa: Dammit... Still sounds fishy to me.

Morinaga: There's going to be a meeting at midnight. We should get back to the hotel.

[They leave Kiryu’s apartment.]

Morinaga: You have my thanks, Fourth Chairman.

Kiryu: Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

Morinaga: Not at all. It's enough to know you haven't given up on Chairman Dojima. Thank you.

Kiryu: Stay safe out there.

Morinaga: We will. Bye then.

[They bow and walk away.]

Morinaga: Ah, right. There's something I should probably tell you, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: What is it?

Morinaga: That girl. Mayumi-san, yes? She's… 

[He tells something to Kiryu.]

Morinaga: So you know. Goodnight, then.

[Aizawa and Morinaga leave. Kiryu closes the door and stands against it thinking about Morinaga’s words.]

Kiryu: (Hmm, it's getting pretty late. Should I get some sleep?)

Yes ✓
Not Yet

Kiryu: (Need to be ready for whatever might happen tomorrow.)

The next day…

Kiryu: (I’m on the late shift today. It's about time to head in.)

[Someone knocks at Kiryu’s door.]

Stranger: Hello? Is anyone home? I thought I'd just come by to greet my new neighbor.

Kiryu: (Did someone move in next door?)

Open the Door ✓
Pretend You're Not Home

Stranger: Oh, hello there. I'm with the Nagasu Times, and I'd like to offer you a great deal on a newspaper subscription!

Kiryu: What? I thought you were here because you moved in.

Newspaper Salesman: No, you just moved in, right? So I came to welcome you into the neighborhood!

Kiryu: I’ve been living here six months.

Newspaper Salesman: (laughs) Oh, you have? Huh, I didn't know that. I thought you must be a new resident. In any case, I’d be more than happy to get you signed up with our paper. How about I give you a free trial for the first month? Cancellation fees may still apply.

Kiryu: So you're actually selling newspapers? And you use that moving in line to get people to open the door?

Newspaper Salesman: Hey, don't make it sound like I'm a criminal. I did say hi, didn't I? Now, all I need is your signature, and you'll be waking up to that fresh newspaper smell in no time!

No Way ✓
Okay

Kiryu: No way. Try that scheme on someone else.

Newspaper Salesman: Oh, but. it's not that easy, you know. What with the proliferation of the internet and all, nobody reads the paper anymore. The medium's in danger of dying, friend. Our goal at the Nagasu Times is to support more local news, so it would really help your community if you decided to join the cause. Besides, all your neighbors said yes. Don't be a sore thumb. Come on. Is there any way I could get you to reconsider?

Get out of here. ✓
Must be tough, huh? 
Okay, you sold me.

Kiryu: Get out of here, I won't say it again.

Newspaper Salesman: What's with the attitude, bro? Is that any way to talk to a guest?

Kiryu: Hmph. You worm your way into someone's home, and now you're talking manners?

Newspaper Salesman: You watch your mouth, asshole. I don't take any bullshit from guys like you! Apologize to me right now! Do it!

I'm calling the cops.
Sorry about that.
Enough of this. ✓

Kiryu: Okay, I've had just about enough of this.

Newspaper Salesman: Huh? What are you gonna do, then? You don't think I can take your ass out!? That's it. I'm through dickin' around! Step outside and we'll settle this the hard way!

Kiryu: Heh. I wonder what you have in mind.

Newspaper Salesman: I mean I'm gonna cut the sales pitch and give your face a tune up. You're dead meat now!

[Kiryu quickly beats up the salesman.]

Newspaper Salesman: Okay, okay, my bad. Give me a break, just this once! I promise not to bother you again! Never ever!

Kiryu: I bet you've caught tons of people out with those pushy thoughtless sales tactics, haven't you?

Newspaper Salesman: Oh, no, sir! Not at all!

Kiryu: Well you'd better drop the sales pitch altogether. If I hear you've been at it again, you'll have me to answer to. Got that?

Newspaper Salesman: Yup! Got it! Won't do it again! Honest to goodness! Here, why don't you take this? Hopefully it'll make up for my inexcusable and completely uncharacteristic behavior! Really, I'm sorry as sorry can be! I just see myself out now. Have a nice day!

[Kiryu comes out of the yard of his house and sees Wada across the street. He’s holding his stomach and looks unwell.]

Wada: Oh, Suzuki-san.Just the man I wanted to see.

Kiryu: Wada-san? What can I help you with?

b>Wada: So, I was right in the middle of a ride, see, when all of a sudden the bubbleguts got me. Stomach pains, y'know? Anyway they got so bad I had to get up and push out a great big—

Kiryu: I think I get the picture. Are you gonna be okay?

Wada: Not till it all settles down… down there. Anyway, I explained to the chief that I'm a little backed up, so I'm gonna need some backup. I know you're technically off-shift, but would you mind taking this passenger for me?

Kiryu: Do you really need me to do it?

Wada: I could certainly use the help. I’ll go ahead and notify the chief that—Ooh! Oh geez! Owowow!

Kiryu: (Looks like he's in pretty bad shape. He should probably be lying down.) Okay, you just leave it to me. Go get off your feet as soon as you can.

Wada: Whew, I owe ya one... Um, 'scuse me. Another driver will be taking over from here, one of our finest. Will that be all right with you, sir?

Man in Black: ……

[This passenger seems familiar to Kiryu…]

Wada: I owe you one, Suzuki-sa... Ooof. (runs away)

Kiryu: Sorry to keep you waiting.

Man in Black: ……

Kiryu: (Huh? I know this guy...)

Man in Black: Do my eyes deceive me, or is that the baddest cat to ever walk the streets of Japan? Whoa-ho-ho, I knew it! Kiryu-san! Dude, it's me, Mack Shinozuka! We used to kick it a few years back. Remember?

Kiryu: (That's right, we have met before. He's a photographer that travels around the world, if I recall correctly. But...) Sorry, I think you have the wrong guy. I'm Suzuki.

Mack: Hahaha, whatever you say, Kiryu-san! Man, it's good to see you again!

Kiryu: Like I said, my name is Suzuki…

Mack: (punching air and jumping all of a sudden) Sure is a trip running into you out here! Shouldn't you be in Kamurocho, doing crazy yakuza stuff—you know, busting heads, taking names?

Kiryu: (He's not listening... I can't risk anyone hearing this, so I’d better get us both on the road.) I get you where you want to go, sir. Please, hop in.

Mack: (still jumping) You got it, Kiryu-san, old buddy!

[They get in a taxi and leave.]

Kiryu: (...At least in here, no one can hear him call me by name.)

Mack: ...And boy, did I run into a fiasco in India! How'd they expect me to know—Hey, are you listening, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Oh, uh, yeah. How have you been?

Mack: You know me, man. Busy as a globetrotting bumblebee, looking for all those perfect shots.

Kiryu: How would you define a perfect shot?

Mack: Let me tell you like this, It's when a scene catches your eye, and next thing you know, it sucks you into a trance. Something so powerful, it gives you a Revelation.

Kiryu: A Revelation, huh…

Mack: You betcha. See, when someone's got a Revelation, it means their brain is going on overdrive. That hyped-up mode of thinking unlocks new powers within. Not to toot my own horn, but as a photographic phenom, it's my mission in life to compile as many groundbreaking, breathtaking, Revelation-triggering snapshots as possible!

Kiryu: Yeah... remember you saying something like that when we last met.

Mack: Oh for sure. You helped me out a ton back then, remember?

Kiryu: Did I?

Mack: Of course! All those super-wicked shots you sent me changed my life! And I don't say that lightly. Though lately, you haven't sent me a thing. That was a bitter pill to swallow, seeing all that premium Kiryu content dwindle down to nothingness in my inbox. My emotional life was impacted.

Kiryu: Sorry about that... As you can see, I've been a bit busy.

Mack: Ah, don't worry, it's cool. All water under the bridge! You can always start fresh when it comes to finding perfect shots—so let's make some new Revelations on the double!

Kiryu: Well, about that…

Mack: Aww, don't tell me you forgot how!

Kiryu: ……
Mack: Well hey. That's no problem. I'm sure my ultra-bestie Kiryu-san can retrain himself to snap up perfect pictures in no time! Ooh, let me out here, please!

[Kiryu stops the car. He and Mack leave it.]

Mack: Hm… Hmmm… ...Kiryu-san. My Mack senses. They speak to me. A decisive moment’s in the making, and it's gonna go down nearby!

Kiryu: How can you tell?

Mack: Shoot, I've taken so many of these dang photos, it's like I have a sixth sense! ...For good shots, not ghosts, ya dig. But yeah! I know a Revelation's about to happen here. I can feel it rattlin' away in my bones!

[Someone calls Mack.]

Mack: Hold on. Gotta take this real quick. Our date? Oh, of course! Our date! Ahaha! Sorry, honey. No, I didn't forget! I was just... uh... having a Revelation? No, no, wait! I was actually on my way right now! Be there fast as I can! Love you, sweetheart. See you in a few, okay? (hungs up) My b, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: What happened?

Mack: Gotta bounce. Something urgent just sprung up. I do hate to miss a photo op—feels like my heart's getting sliced clean in two. But I know you can do it, Kiryu-san! You're always the man for the job!

Kiryu: Hey, just a minute here…

Mack: Adios, amigo! (runs away)

Kiryu: (He seemed pretty sure something was about to go down here... But what could it be? In any case, I’d better get this cab back over to Nagasu Taxi.)

[A man runs up to him.]

Man: Hey! You! I need a ride, quick! *gasp* Follow that cab up ahead! *pant*

Kiryu: Uh…

Man: What, you gonna turn down a payin' customer!?

Kiryu: I never said that.

Man: Then step on it! They're getting away!

Kiryu: (Refusing a ride might not look good on the company. And he's already pretty agitated… Guess I have no choice.) Okay, get in.

Man: Make sure you don't let them know we're following them... Heh, heheheh. You're gonna lead me right to your doorstep, Ryoko-chan, my sweet!

Kiryu: (Something's really off about this guy. I should probably let the other taxi get away and make it look like an accident.)

Creeper: Hehehe. I’ll see you soon, sweet little Ryoko-chan! Heheh. She'll never spot me back here. They're a little too far ahead. Can you get a bit closer? If you fall back any further we'll lose them! Hurry up and close the gap!

[Kiryu deliberately fails.]

Kiryu: Sorry. I tried my best, but I lost them.

Creeper: Aw, crap! And I was this close to figuring out where Ryoko-chan lives! Why'd you do it, huh!? You lost her on purpose! Didn't you!

Kiryu: Don't be rude, sir. Of course I didn't.

Creeper: Hmph! You're full of shit. Fine then! This lion's just gonna have to chase his gazelle on foot! Oh, and I'm never takin' your stinkin' taxi again! (runs away)

Kiryu: Hold on, sir! Your fare! Damn…

[A fat taxi driver approaches Kiryu.]

Taxi Driver: Ah, there you are.

Kiryu: Do I know you?

Taxi Driver: The name's Oyama. I was driving the taxi in front of you earlier. You lost me intentionally back there, right? Thanks for doing that.

Kiryu: Oh, that was you? Sorry, I never wanted to tail you.

Oyama: Mm, that's okay. I could tell something was up.

Kiryu: Do you have any idea what was going on between our passengers?

Oyama: Not much. Mine was a young girl. She said a stalker was following her, and asked me to shake him off.

Kiryu: Has this happened before?

Oyama: Apparently this wasn't the first time. It sounds like he's been after her a while. Thanks to you, nothin' came of it, though.

Kiryu: So that's what he was up to... I knew something about him was off. Well, I'm just glad the girl ended up safe.

Oyama: Shame this sort of thing happens... I’ve picked this girl up a few times now. She's around my daughter's age, so I wanted to make sure she was all right.

Kiryu: …That’s good of you.

Oyama: Well, I’d better get back to work. Thanks for cooperating.

Kiryu: No, thank you.

[Oyama leaves and Wada approaches Kiryu.]

Wada: There's the man. Hey, Suzuki-san!

Kiryu: Oh, Wada-san. How are you feeling?

Wada: Better. I appreciate you taking over. Whatever foul plague was infesting my stomach has started to clear up already.

Kiryu: Good to hear.

Wada: Okay, then it's back to work for me. Thanks again. (bows) 

Kiryu: Sure thing.

[He returns to the taxi station.]

Kiryu: Hey there.

Hirakawa: Hello, Suzuki-san. Do you have a moment?

Kiryu: Sure.

Hirakawa: It's not urgent, but can you go run an errand for me? That chief of ours went out to get some food and still hasn't come back.

Kiryu: Do you know where he went?

Hirakawa: I think he's at his favorite diner again. Can you go bring him back for me?

Kiryu: Sure. I'll have him back here in no time.

[He leaves the station.]

Kiryu: (The chief's favorite diner is in the alley at the north end of Chikuzengawa Street.)

[Kiryu goes to the diner and bumps into the old man we saw at the end of the first chapter. He had already smoked a few cigarettes by the time they met, so he must have been waiting for Kiryu.]

Old Man: Nagasu Taxi's Suzuki-san, yeah?

Kiryu: And you are?

Old Man: Take a gander.

[He shows his police badge. It has a name - Serizawa Kazuhiko.]

Kiryu: Osaka Prefectural?

Serizawa: I'm lookin' into a yakuza incident, see. Seems the Tojo Clan's Chairman Dojima… He up and poof, disappeared here in Fukuoka last night.

Kiryu: So I've heard.

Serizawa: Ya wouldn't have any idea where he got off to, would ya? Turns out this Dojima took a nice ride in your taxi last night. I've got witnesses.

Kiryu: Don't even know the guy.

Serizawa: The passenger you dropped off at Daimyo Bridge.

Kiryu: Not a clue. I let him out like I do anyone else. That was the last I saw of him.

[Serizawa presses Kiryu against the wall.]

Serizawa: I don't buy what you're sellin'. I know he's an old pal of yours. Got that, Kiryu-san?

[They look at each other for a second.]

Serizawa: Not wise tryin' to pull a fast one on a cop. Now, I don't know why ya came down to Fukuoka… But you bet your ass we've been keepin' tabs on you.

[Serizawa releases Kiryu.]

Kiryu: Aren't you a little far from home? Osaka and Fukuoka aren't exactly neighbors.

Serizawa: I got shipped down to Nagasugai. 'Cause of the Omi Alliance captain, Watase.

Kiryu: What? What's someone like that doing in Fukuoka?

Serizawa: The seventh Omi chairman is terminally ill. Ya hear 'bout that?

Kiryu: I'm aware, yeah.

Serizawa: If he croaks, the Omi truce with the Tojo'll go up in flames. No truce, nothin' to stop an all-out war. So the Tojo Clan has been runnin' around the whole country, makin' alliances. Dojima came to Fukuoka to butter up the local folks personally. And Watase made his way down to stop him.

Kiryu: Stop the alliance? Is the Omi trying to beat the Tojo Clan to it?

Serizawa: Beats me. All I know is, they're tryin' to keep the Tojo from joinin' up with the Yamagasa Family. And if they don't get what they want… They could crush the Yamagasa Family without battin' an eye. So in a flash, Nagasugai's the hottest spot in the country for yakuza types. Nowhere else as dangerous, or crucial. All eyes are on this town like it's ground zero. ‘Course, thes Tojo Clan's well aware that Watase came down to Fukuoka.

Kiryu: Uh-huh. Which means, you think Daigo was kidnapped by...

Serizawa: Yeah. The Omi. That's most likely, anyway. With Daigo Dojima off the board, the alliance talks would stall. Even if the Tojo appointed an acting chairman… With Dojima as a bargaining chip, the Omi could swing things in their favor.

Kiryu: And what, you tracked me down just to tell me all this?

Serizawa: (smirks) Well, let's not be hasty. I'm just gettin' to my point. You ran into two Tojo goons who were supposed to be guardin' Dojima, yeah? Names're Morinaga and Aizawa, I think?

Kiryu: What about them?

Serizawa: I'm gonna have to ask you to keep them from doing anything stupid.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Serizawa: If the Watase Family did kidnap Daigo Dojima, sure as shit those two'll jump into action. It'd be the spark the Omi is waiting for to hit back against the Tojo Clan. Bringin' the inferno of war.

Kiryu: That would be catastrophic.

Serizawa: Ya get it now? I need you to go talk Watase off the ledge before it comes to that.

Kiryu: Why me? I cut ties with the Tojo Clan. I'm not yakuza anymore.

Serizawa: That's exactly why it has to be you. You're the only one who can pull this off. Ya got the knowledge, the influence… But you're far enough removed to be impartial. Meanin', you're the perfect guy for the job. Imagine it helps that you're no slouch in a fight.

Kiryu: Why can't the police handle it?

Serizawa: Don't be thick. It wouldn't fix a damn thing if we arrested an Omi officer. I couldn't even tell you all the shit that would set in motion. Best thing to do is hold out an olive branch, resolve this peacefully.

Kiryu: What's in it for you?

Serizawa: If us Osaka boys get the credit instead of the Tokyo blue… Maybe we can finally stop grovelin' at their feet. Think you're familiar. Lady detective of ours got a little too friendly with this famous yakuza. Now our Organized Crime unit's the butt of every joke. We gotta show 'em that Osaka's still got a role to play in these big-time cases.

Kiryu: Right. Sounds like going after Watase would help us both, then. 

Serizawa: So, what do you say? Are you in?

Kiryu: Where's Watase now?

Serizawa: At some club knockin' a few back with his top guys. Place called Olivier, if I'm rememberin' right.

Kiryu: Olivier? Wait...

Serizawa: Ya know it? Well ain't that a nice coincidence. I promise, no matter how rough ya get, we won't go bulldozin' the life you built here. We'll hope for the best. See ya.

[Serizawa leaves. Kiryu finds his boss.]

Nakajima: Phew, that was a feast! Man, their sashimi really is somethin' else. Huh? That you, Suzuki-san?

Kiryu: Yeah, it's me.

Nakajima: Oh. Well what brings ya out here?

Kiryu: Actually... Hirakawa-san asked me to come get you.

Nakajima: What, I stay out too long or somethin’? Sorry ‘bout that. All I remember is I was havin' a mighty good meal, so I ordered some more drinks and… poof! Where's the time all go? Hahaha!

Kiryu: Sorry to interrupt, Chief, but…

Nakajima: Yeah?

Kiryu: Something urgent has actually come up. Would it be all right if I asked you to head back alone?

Nakajima: Y'got it, buddy. Not a problem.

Kiryu: Thank you. I really appreciate it. (bows)

[Nakajima leaves.]

Kiryu: (So the Omi Alliance sent Watase over to Olivier. Things are bound to go wrong if Morinaga gets there before I do. I have to get to him first!)

Head to Olivier
Kiryu: (Olivier's the spot, huh...)

[Kiryu finds the place he and Nakajima were earlier.]

Attendant: Welcome. Will you be coming in, sir?

Kiryu: Sure.

Attendant: Excellent! This way, please.

[Kiryu enters Olivier.]

Watase's Subordinate: Huh? Who the hell're you?

Kiryu: I came to talk with Watase of the Omi Alliance.

Watase's Subordinate: Say what? Which family you with, dirtbag?

Kiryu: I'm not with any family. I'm just a taxi driver.

Watase's Subordinate: A taxi driver, he says? Hoo, that's a riot. Hey boys, who needs a lift! Hahaha! Oh, you're in luck. The boss just got back.

[Watase returns to the room and his yakuza stands up.]

Watase: (to a hostess) A few drops of the good stuff and my stomach  starts snivelin'. Guess I'm gettin' old. (sits) Now then, where were we?
Watase's Subordinate: Boss. This taxi driver here says he's got business with ya.

Watase: Huh? Don't remember callin' no taxi… The hell you on about?

Watase's Subordinate: Well, boss. I don't think he's a regular ol' taxi driver.

Watase: (looks at Kiryu) Huh. Well ain't this the damnedest sight. Take a nice long look, boys. Our friend here's a livin' legend. Ex-Tojo fourth chairman… Kazuma Kiryu-han.

[His yakuza gets a bit tense.]

Watase: But where'd my manners go? Forgot to introduce myself. (respectful pose) I'm captain for the seventh chairman of the Omi Alliance. Patriarch of the Watase Family, Masaru Watase. Good meetin' ya.

[MASARU WATASE. Captain of the Omi Alliance, Patriarch of the Watase Family.]

Kiryu: So you're Watase.

[Watase nods to the girls and they leave.]

Watase: Well, this sure came outta the blue. Didn't think ya'd come trackin' me down first, Kiryu-han.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Watase: Ya tellin' me you don't know? We didn't come all this way for a night on the town. Kiryu-han… We're here to see you.

Kiryu: Don't lie to me. Just tell me where Daigo is. Now.

Watase: Huh? Ya don't know? Then I reckon ya better find your Tojo pals and ask 'em yourself.

Kiryu: Don't play dumb. I know you're the one who kidnapped Daigo. You're here to stop the Tojo from swearing the oath with the Yamagasa Family.

Watase: So the sixth chairman's seriously up n' disappeared? I'd heard rumblings, but… Guess it's really true.

Kiryu: Just drop the act already. I don't have time for your games.

Watase: I  get ya, I get ya. I'm seein' the full picture now. Kiryu-han. That's why ya swung by here, huh? 'Cause ya think I went n' made off with Dojima?

Kiryu: No reason to believe otherwise.

Watase: Sounds to me like you're not interested in hearin' me out, then.

Kiryu: Not really, no.

Watase: If looks could kill. Try hidin' it all ya want, but I see the real you. That dragon on your back's got a spark o' life in it yet.

Kiryu: I've heard enough. It's time to settle this.

[Watase’s yakuza surrounds Kiryu.]

Watase: Little pop quiz, first. Gotta see if the Dragon of Dojima lives up to the legends. Don't pull any punches, boys! He's not leavin' alive!

[Dojima Dragon confirms his title and quickly takes out the yakuza, but age gradually takes its toll. The fight wore him out considerably.]

Watase: (clapping) What a champ. Those boys are no pushovers, but you mopped the damn floor with 'em. Guess ya haven't lost your touch!

Kiryu: So, time to tell me the truth.

Watase: (casually reading menu) Uh... 'Bout what, again?

Kiryu: Knock it off. Tell me where Daigo is! If you're really yakuza... you'll know when to get serious.

Watase: Ooh, scary. No need to pull protocol on me. Not like we're in a rush. Oh, would ya look at that. Hey, 'scuse me. Gimme the fanciest bottle on the menu. C'mon, Kiryu-han. Lemme treat ya to somethin' nice for yer trouble.

[Kiryu approaches the table.]

Watase: Why the long face? Go on, pull up a chair.

Waiter: Apologies for the wait, sir. Is this to your liking?

Watase: This your top o' the shelf shit, yeah?

Waiter: Yes. That's right, sir...

Watase: Then hand it over. Crazy to be drinkin' with you, Kiryu-han. Wouldn't look good, pourin' any ol’ sewer juice for ya. 

[He pops out the cork and takes asip.]

Watase: C'mon, Kiryu-han. Your turn.

[Kiryu smashes the bottle with a punch.]

Watase: You're a real charmer.

Kiryu: I prefer drinking alone. Not really interested in sharing a bottle.

Watase: So I see. Funny, though. That's not what I heard.

Kiryu: What are you talking about?

Watase: Three days back, you n’ your boss were havin' a grand ol' time in here. Ya shared a drink with him, yeah? Figured ya'd show me the same courtesy. Real punch in the gut!

Kiryu: Hold on. How do you know about that?

Watase: My sworn brother flyin' the other colors. The Tojo Clan chief of HQ, Minoru Aoyama.

Kiryu: Aoyama?

Watase: He's Chairman Dojima's pet secretary. Everythin' the good chairman knows, Aoyama's gonna know, too. Implyin' Aoyama knew all along ya were layin' low in this nothin' town. He's been keepin' tabs on ya, you know. Makin' sure ya don't try anythin' funny. Finally said somethin' to pique your interest, huh? Then c'mon, take a load off.

[Kiryu sits on a chair next to Watase.]

Kiryu: Tell me everything. What's your relationship with Aoyama?

Watase: We exchanged vows of brotherhood ‘bout a year back. We're sworn brothers across families.

Kiryu: But you're the captain of the Omi Alliance, and he's just the Tojo Clan chief of headquarters. You outrank him by far.

Watase: Yeah, and swearing an oath with that little weed made me wanna vomit at first, but the seventh chairman insisted. Can't just say no to that.

Kiryu: The Omi chairman was willing to go that far to prevent conflict with the Tojo Clan?

Watase: You got it. Call it a strategic alliance, if ya like. But with the seventh chairman fadin' to dust, I plan to do just as I please from here on in.

Kiryu: So did you come to Fukuoka to take part in Aoyama's plan to get rid of Daigo?

Watase: Nope. Only thing Aoyama told me ‘bout was you. Couldn't give less of a damn ‘bout Dojima.

Kiryu: You still insist on lying to me.

Watase: Ain't no lie. All I heard was you were down in Fukuoka, so I came runnin’. No other reason, I swear.

Kiryu: But why would you come all this way just to see me? You must have your eye on the Omi chairman's seat. Meeting me does nothing for your chances.

Watase: You don't get it, do ya, Kiryu-han? I got no interest in squabblin' over the throne. My sights are set on what's after. The war with the Tojo Clan when I become eighth chairman.

Kiryu: What?

Watase: I can get the chairman's spot without liftin' a finger. No other Omi man's got what it takes. No, what I'm really keen on figuring out is who's gonna be top of the Tojo once my reign starts. That's what matters to me.

Kiryu: What are you implying? It’ll be Daigo leading the Tojo, same as always.

Watase: Well then we have a problem. 'Cause fightin' a weak-ass clan led by a weak-ass man ain't worth my time. There are far better candidates for his spot out there.

Kiryu: What are you trying to say?

Watase: Look. The Omi Alliance hasn't beaten the Tojo Clan once, even if you go back to Fifth Chairman Jin Goda. We had more soldiers, more cash, more power, yet we never came out on top. Why is that?

Kiryu: ……

Watase: Because they owed their strength to you, Kiryu-han.

Kiryu: ……

Watase: Take Ryuji Goda, toughest bastard I knew. Had all of Kansai on his side. Yet his assault on Kanto was stopped single-handed by a guy fresh outta retirement. And that ain't all. Even when the Tojo Clan was tearin' itself apart, all we could do was sit back on our asses and watch. The reason? ‘Cause Kazuma Kiryu was back in town bustin' skulls.

Kiryu: You're wrong. Daigo's the one who protected the Tojo Clan. I only helped finish what I had started during my time.

Watase: That right there, is the worst goddamn part of it.

Kiryu: What are you talking about?

Watase: You've got no ego, and even less ambition. Yet your every move draws crowds to you. Anyone who gets a whiff of that power you got will follow ya to the ends of the earth. Including Daigo Dojima.

Kiryu: Enough rambling. What exactly did you hope to accomplish by meeting me here?

Watase: Well, I was hoping I could persuade ya to join the ranks. Of the Tojo Clan, of course.

Kiryu: What?

Watase: I’m gonna need to fight the Tojo sooner or later if I wanna control this country. But right now those boys are nothin' but losers, barely worth whackin' on the head.

Kiryu: ……

Watase: If I’m gonna prove ľ'm better than the Dragon of Kansai, Ryuji Goda, I gotta make an impact. So I need a big, bad rival like you to wake everyone the fuck up. I want you back with the Tojo Clan, no matter what it takes. That's what I came to Fukuoka to tell ya. You believe me now?

[Kiryu tosses aside the table and stands up.]

Watase: Callin' it a night? I wasn't finished talkin'.

[Kiryu grabs Watase by the tie and lifts him off the couch.]

Watase: What're ya playin' at, Kiryu-han?

Kiryu: I've figured you out. You want me back in the Tojo Clan, so you kidnapped Daigo.

Watase: Think ya know me? You ain't figured out shit.

[He grabs Kirya's hand and squeezes it violently.]

Watase: I don't give a single fuck where Daigo Dojima is. The real problem is you bein' here not solvin' it for yourself. If Dojima kicks the bucket, the Tojo Clan's gonna cave in on itself. (loudly) What good's a war if the enemy's already dead!? That ain't the yakuza way! All I care about is the fight! I ain't one of those sad sacks who sits on their ass countin' their cash! I went yakuza to go up against the strongest of the strong! Seein' the Tojo like this makes me wanna cry, man! And if Daigo Dojima eats it, any Omi chump could blow it down. That ain't the Tojo I know. They deserve better than that!

Kiryu: Watase...

Watase: I know you Down in your gut, ya got the same bloodlust I do. So let's drop the pretense, Kiryu-han. We're as yakuza as yakuza come. I can see in your eyes how bored ya are out here! Go back to the Tojo Clan. Then we can have a blast makin' a proper war out of it.

[Kiryu walks towards the exit.]

Watase: What, leavin' without a word?

Kiryu: You've got me all wrong. I'm nothing like you. You consider the yakuza a way to die. To me, being yakuza… It's a way to live.

Watase: Care to elaborate?

Kiryu: We walk the same path, but you're barreling toward death, while I fight for life. You'll get it one day.

Watase: Yeah? Lookin' forward to it.

[Kiryu exits the building. Morinaga and Aizawa run up to him.]

Morinaga: Fourth Chairman!

Aizawa: What are you doing here?

Kiryu: I thought I might find you two here. I came for the same reason as you. I heard Watase from the Omi Alliance was in there.

Aizawa: But why'd you have to…

Kiryu: I was worried you wouldn't be able to keep your cool. It could have easily ended up a bloodbath.

Morinaga: But Watase showing up in Fukuoka has got to be linked to the chairman's disappearance, right?

Kiryu: No, Watase's in the clear. He didn't kidnap Daigo.

Morinaga: And he told you that himself?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Aizawa: Hold on! You're not actually going to believe the word of an Omi boss, are you? Who else would have a motive!?

Kiryu: He was telling the truth. Watase isn't the type to plot some underhanded scheme. It's safe to assume he wasn't involved with Daigo's disappearance.

Morinaga: If you say so, ľ'm sure you're right.

Aizawa: But then who's behind it!?

Kiryu: That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Do you have a few?

Morinaga: We'll always make time for you, Fourth Chairman. Just give us the word and we'll follow.

Then let's go. ✓
Hold off for a bit.

Kiryu: Okay. Come with me, then.

[They drive somewhere in Kiryu’s taxi.]

Aizawa: Why are we doing this in a taxi?

Kiryu: You never know who might be listening in. This is the safest place to talk.

Aizawa: What do you mean?

Morinaga: You think someone might be tailing us?

Kiryu: Yes. Watase knew I was here, and had details of my movements ever since I gave Daigo a ride the other day.

Aizawa: What!?

Morinaga: Who's Watase's source?

Kiryu: Daigo's assistant. Aoyama, chief of HQ.

Aizawa: (shocked) Huh!? Patriarch Aoyama!?

Morinaga: ……

Kiryu: Aoyama and Watase are sworn brothers. It doesn't exactly sound like they're friendly, but Aoyama's the one who told Watase I was here and called him to Fukuoka.

Aizawa: Why would he do that?

Kiryu: I don't know. But I do know Aoyama had an eye on me even before Daigo went missing.

Morinaga: Maybe he's putting pressure on the Yamagasa.

Kiryu: It's possible. Aoyama knew that Watase, being the Omi man he is, would naturally want to know what I'm up to.

Aizawa: What do you mean?

Kiryu: Aoyama got Watase to come to Fukuoka, knowing he would make a move right away.

Morinaga: With the Watase Family here during negotiations, the Yamagasa Family would naturally assume the Omi wanted to stop their alliance with the Tojo Clan. The threat of conflict with the Omi would then push the Yamagasa Family into making an alliance.

Aizawa: So Aoyama got Watase to come to Fukuoka as leverage for the negotiations.

Kiryu: There's one thing I still don't know.

Morinaga: What's that?

Kiryu: Whether Daigo knew about Aoyama's plans.

Aizawa: Huh? That's hard to say for sure.

Morinaga: Did Chairman Dojima hint at anything?

Kiryu: When Daigo was in my cab, I could tell he was willing to put his life on the line for this to succeed. Given his resolve, would he really have been okay bringing a wild card like the Watase Family to a clan negotiation? If my hunch is right, there's only one man who could be responsible for his disappearance.

Aizawa: You don't mean Patriarch Aoyama!?

Kiryu: Where is he now?

Morinaga: Well… 

Kiryu: What's wrong?

Morinaga: Patriarch Aoyama left to negotiate with Patriarch Madarame. As acting chairman.

Kiryu: What? Where!?

Morinaga: North of Nagasugai. Yamagasa Family headquarters!

[Kiryu drives to Yamagasa HQ.]

Guard: Y'need somethin', old man? This here's private property.

Kiryu: My name is Suzuki from Nagasu Taxi.

Guard: Yeah? And what's a taxi driver doin' here?

Kiryu: We got a call for a pickup. Nobody told you?

Guard: Naw, I didn't hear a thing about no taxi.

Kiryu: Strange. The call was from an Aoyama-san of the Tojo Clan.

Guard: The Tojo Clan, huh?

Kiryu: That's right, sir, It sounded urgent. I don't think he'd be happy to hear I was late because of you.

Guard: Oh, er... yeah. All right, lemme check on that real quick. Stay put, y’hear? (runs away)

Kiryu: Let's move.

Morinaga: Okay!

Head to the Top Floor!
Kiryu: It's quiet.

Morinaga: They're probably all guarding the patriarch's room. That works in our favor.

Kiryu: It's probably on the top floor. Let's start by heading there. Hm? A lookout. Last thing we need is him calling his friends over.  

Morinaga: Yes, it's best to avoid trouble if possible. Hm? If we go in through that door, we might be able to circle around behind the lookout.

Kiryu: Good thinking. Let's give it a try.

Yamagasa Family Member: What the shit? How'd ya get in here!?

Kiryu: So much for avoiding a fight.

Morinaga: No other choice. Let's finish this quickly.

Yamagasa Family Member: What the flyin' shit? How'd ya get in here!? Get 'em, boys!

Kiryu: Damn, the lookout spotted us. We better hurry.

[Kiryu, Morinaga and Aizawa fight their way to the top floor of the Yamagasa HQ.]

Morinaga: Gunfire!?

Kiryu: Let's hurry!

[They run into the room. Patriarch Madarame lies on the floor, but he is still alive. Aoyama is standing next to the body.]

Morinaga: Patriarch Aoyama! What have you done?

Aoyama: I thought you'd come. You sure took your sweet time.

Kiryu: So, you're Aoyama.

Morinaga: What's going on here? Were supposed to be swearing an oath with the Yamagasa, not murdering their patriarch.

Aoyama: Hmph. It doesn't take a genius to figure out I’d never settle for such humiliation. Isn't that why you're here? To stop me? The truth is, I never had the slightest intention of an alliance with the Yamagasa. My plan was to dangle a tempting amount of cash in their faces, then slowly wring their necks.

[There’s a suitcase full of money on the table. It has a bomb in it.]

Aoyama: I can see how our friend here lasted so long as chairman, even if he was merely the head of a backwoods family. It seems Madarame was on to me from the very beginning. All it took was a moment's distraction and he already had his gun trained on me. Fortunately for me, he missed. So I took him down with the knife I always keep on my person.

Morinaga: But why? Why are you doing this?

Aoyama: You know why. The mighty rock that is the Tojo Clan has no business with pebbles like the Yamagasa.

Morinaga: But Chairman Dojima wanted this alliance to go through. Are you really going to go behind his back on this?

Aoyama: Chairman Dojima? I believe you mean former chairman.

Morinaga: What did you just say!?

Aoyama: I said I'm in charge of the Tojo Clan now. And so long as the chairman remains missing, whatever I say goes.

Morinaga: Grr…

Aoyama: It's pretty simple, as I see it. In the yakuza ocean, you either eat or be eaten. Why waste time negotiating when we could be swallowing the Yamagasa whole? It's only logical. And whether it's Dojima or Kiryu, the same rule applies. Once you've given up the throne, you're nothing more than a relic of the past.

Morinaga: Patriarch Aoyama. So you're the one who kidnapped Chairman Dojima!

[He points his gun at Aoyama.]


Aoyama: What do you think you're doing? Put the gun down.

Morinaga: I want an answer!

Aoyama: Do you realize what you're doing? I'm the acting chairman. The very top of the Tojo Clan. You think you can just shoot me?

Morinaga: (ready to shoot) That depends on your answer.

[He closes his eyes and… shoots. After a few bullets fall on the carpet he opens his eyes… and Aoyama is still standing.]

Aizawa: Aniki, what was that!?

Aoyama: (smirks) They're blanks. It's the only way I'd be sure I could trust you. Can't give a loose cannon punk like you real bullets, now can I?

[He picks up a gun from the floor.]

Aoyama: What if you'd mistakenly shot a civilian? We'd have the force breathing down our necks. I'm quite strict about misconduct in my ranks. You're aware what comes next, Morinaga.

[He points his gun at Morinaga.]

Morinaga: Patriarch Aoyama!

Aoyama: Farewell.

[He shot Morinaga.]

Aizawa: Aniki!

Kiryu: Morinaga! Aoyama... How could you?

Aoyama: Don't get involved, Fourth Chairman. I prefer to keep this internal. A matter of Tojo discipline.

Kiryu: You bastard!

[Aoyama drops the gun and kicks it toward Kiryu. He raises his arms in the air.]

Aoyama: I must thank you. You've given me just the out I needed to make a clean getaway.

Kiryu: What?

[There is a knock on the door. Aoyama lies down on the floor. His sidekick finishes off the patriarch Madarama. Yakuza in red tracksuits run into the room фдщng with their captain - Yahata.]

Yahata: What's goin' on in here!? The fuck!?

Aoyama: Captain Yahata! They assaulted Patriarch Madarame.

Yahata: They what!? Boss! Boss...! Someone, call an ambulance! We gotta get 'im to a hospital!

[Yakuza takes Madarame and Aoyama out of the room. Aoyama smiles at Kiryu.]

Yahata: Who're you, asshole? 

Kiryu: It might take a while to explain. Aizawa!

Aizawa: Yeah!

Kiryu: Get Morinaga out of here.

Aizawa: But…!

Kiryu: I'll hold them off! Just go! Don't let him… Don't you dare let him die!

Aizawa: Okay!

[He takes the barely alive Morinaga with him.]

Yahata: So yer the one who stabbed the boss?

Kiryu: No. But under the circumstances… I doubt you'd believe what I have to say.

Yahata: Don't wanna hear yer excuses. 'You'll pay for this with yer life. Die, you son of a bitch!

[Kiryu knocks out Captain Yahata and then escapes the Yamagasa HQ through hordes of yakuza!]

Yamagasa Family Member: Shit, this guy got through Yahata-aniki! Everyone get your asses over here!

Kiryu: (Dammit. Better make my way outside before more of them show up. So they called reinforcements. Hm? That daruma is pretty big. Maybe I could roll it down the stairs. Might help me thin out the crowd.)

[He uses the daruma to clear the path.]

Kiryu: (Dammit, they're guarding the entrance. There are a lot of them. Hm, that float gives me an idea. And it's in the perfect spot, too. Good.)

[He drops the float to clear the path. After getting the key from the fattest and strongest yakuza, Kiryu runs out of the building. There he sees a limousine and Aoyama standing next to it.]

Kiryu: Aoyama.

Aoyama: Well met, Fourth Chairman. I never would have navigated my way out of that spider's web. Good thing I have this.

[He pulls out the detonator for the bomb in the suitcase.]

Kiryu: What are you doing!?

Aoyama: You should be thanking me, Kiryu-san. There'll be no trace of your fight with the Yamagasa. No police breaking down your door. You can keep driving your taxi like nothing ever happened.

Kiryu: Aoyama... Don't do it!

[But Aoyama presses the button and the building explodes. Kiryu is thrown back by the blast wave and falls to the pavement. Aoyama meanwhile leave in the limousine.]

Kiryu: Aoyama!

[All he has to do is look after the limousine as it drives away.]

Chapter 4: DESTINATIONS
The next morning

[Kiryu slowly walks up the stairs to the door of his apartment. He ponders the events that have occurred. The door to his apartment 201 is open. Mayumi sits on the bed and waits for him.]

Kiryu: Mayumi. What are you doing?

[She slowly removes the nightgown she was sitting in. The nightgown falls to the floor, exposing Mayumi's naked body. She hugs Kiryu.]

Mayumi: We've been together six months, yet we've never once had a moment like this. A little affection might be nice, right?

[Kiryu slowly pushes her away from him. He puts the shirt on her that was lying on the floor and sits next to Mayumi.]

Kiryu: Who hired you? The other night, when my boss Nakajima, and I went drinking at your club… Someone in the Tojo Clan found out I was there. The only people in the house were those two Yamagasa Family thugs… None of them knew who I really am. Meaning it was you. You've been helping the Tojo spy on me.

[He gets up and walks toward the exit.]

Mayumi: Wait. There's someone I want you to meet. Kazuma Kiryu-san.

[They come to the hospital.]

Mayumi: I brought a guest.

[There is an old man lying in a hospital bed.]

Kiryu: It's you. The Yamagasa patriarch… Madarame.

Madarame: I appreciate you showing up last night. Though I hear you ended up butting heads with my captain, Yahata.

Kiryu: Glad to see you're okay.

Madarame: In no small part thanks to the bulletproof vest I was wearing. It surely saved my life. In truth, I was warned this might happen. That these Tojo Clan dealings were not all they seemed to be.

Kiryu: Someone warned you?

Madarame: That's right. A very particular person. He said if he were to go missing, and if someone else from the Tojo Clan approached me afterward, that “someone” would betray me.

Kiryu: Go missing? You can't mean—

Madarame: Yes. I was forewarned by none other than Daigo Dojima-san.

Four days ago…

[Patriarch Madarame and Daigo ride in a black limousine through the night city.]

Madarame: Is this suitable, Chairman Dojima?

Daigo: Yes. You have my thanks for arranging the car, Patriarch Madarame.

Madarame: I was surprised you contacted us directly to cancel the hotel meeting, not to mention suggesting a private car as the new location. Was there some kind of problem?

Daigo: This is difficult for me to say for sure… But it's highly likely that one, or both, of our lives was in danger.

Madarame: Hm. That is indeed disconcerting.

Daigo: Every detail of today's meeting at the Nagasu Grand Hotel was organized by the Tojo Clan. And yet, something felt wrong.

Madarame: Wrong? In what way?

Daigo: Usually, negotiations like this are done on the outskirts of town where they are less visible, in a room with only small windows. It always pays to safeguard against attacks or assassination attempts from nearby buildings.

Madarame: Hmm.

Daigo: But that hotel is in the middle of Nagasugai. What's more, the meeting was set to take place in a suite with large windows. You're almost asking to get shot if you hold talks at a location like that. Not to mention, that hotel is practically a labyrinth. It would be impossible to seal off. If the police or another group raided the place, there's no chance we could cover all the entry points. Taking yakuza customs into account, the venue chosen defied any semblance of common sense in the matter. In other words, it would have been a killing field.

Madarame: Are you telling me that one of your men planned to betray the organization? Is that right?

Daigo: Yes. This alliance has met no small amount of opposition from the rank and file clan members.

Madarame: I see.

Daigo: To that end, Patriarch Madarame. I have a favor to ask. After we leave this car, I want you to stick to the story I’m about to tell you. That, and…

Madarame: Hm?

Daigo: Please forgive me for disappearing after this.

Madarame: Disappearing?

[Back to the hospital…]

Madarame: Chairman Dojima wasn't kidnapped. He disappeared of his own accord, to get out of Fukuoka.

Kiryu: Why would he do that?

Madarame: I imagine he was out of options. His life was in grave danger. If he went missing after meeting me, it'd be natural to assume the Yamagasa Family did it. He took advantage of all that confusion to get out of the city.

Kiryu: So then Daigo's back in Tokyo?

Madarame: No. He told me there was something he had to check before that. And he needed to get off the grid to do it.

Kiryu: Do you know what he could have been checking on? Was it regarding the traitor?

Madarame: Based on what he told me… Chairman Dojima was already suspicious of Aoyama. Which would mean… 

Kiryu: Aoyama's not the real traitor.

[Madarame tries to sit and groans in pain.]

Mayumi: Are you okay?

Kiryu: Kiryu-san. It seems I owe you an apology. The one who sent this young lady to spy on your activities in Fukuoka… To leak your whereabouts to the Tojo Clan… I'm afraid it was me.

Kiryu: You?

Madarame: At Chairman Dojima's request, yes. He wanted me to look out for you. To keep your cover in Fukuoka safe.

Kiryu: Daigo did that?

Madarame: It seems Chairman Dojima knew all along that you were in hiding here. He also knew that you had taken an alias. All he wanted was for you to live in peace. To not get dragged back into the fray. That's why he came all the way down here. To ask me to help you.

Kiryu: He went that far?

Madarame: The head of the entire Kanto region… Humbled himself to ask this of some tiny outfit like the Yamagasa Family. Not exactly a common occurrence, as I'm sure you're well aware. Ever since, I've been sharing the information relayed to me by Mayumi with Chairman Dojima.

Kiryu: And your connection to Mayumi?

Madarame: We're family. Mayumi is my daughter.

Kiryu: You'd send your daughter? Really?

Madarame: The fact that you were in Fukuoka had to be kept secret at all costs. I could only entrust the task to someone I trusted unconditionally. Only natural then for me to give the responsibility to Mayumi, my own flesh and blood. (soft laughs) Though, had I known what kind of man Kazuma Kiryu was from the get-go… I might have thought twice about letting her anywhere near you.

Kiryu: Why's that?

Madarame: She's clearly fallen for you. I'm her father. I can't bear to see her struggle with feelings that'll never be reciprocated.

[He hands Kiryu the envelope Mayumi gave him.]

Madarame: Kiryu-san. Here.

Kiryu: What's this?

Madarame: A declaration dissolving the Yamagasa Family. Can I entrust this to you, to take to the police?

Kiryu: Why? Why dissolve the family?

Madarame: My men have grown too big to live in my little castle anymore. The Yamagasa Family's always been small. But it seems I took in too many children. And now it's even put a strain on our relationship with the Tojo Clan. The best I can do for my boys is to make sure they get a chance at life.

Kiryu: Madarame-san.

Madarame: We'd cease to be yakuza anymore. And by ceding our turf, the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance would no longer be gunning for us. That's simply the safest option now. 

Kiryu: If you're really going through with this… It would only be fair if your men heard it directly from you. Right?

Madarame: There's no stopping a Kyushu man once his blood gets pumping. I could tell them not to poke at the Tojo Clan, and they'd still go pick up a stick. Better to let the long arm of the law do what it does. Breaking up the family puts us at the mercy of law enforcement. Not even the Tojo Clan or the Omi Alliance would want to bother with that.

Kiryu: Still. Why me?

Madarame: Under normal circumstances, I'd try to convince them all myself. But… Just look at me. Trying to stop the Tojo from going to war has only landed me in a hospital bed. On top of that, I think if you were the one handing in the declaration… Yahata may actually accept it.

Kiryu: Your captain?

Madarame: You and he came to blows last night. You know, he's not the brightest bulb. Prefers to measure someone's worth through his fists. Fighting is how he comes to understand a man. I guess you could call that his silver lining. I'm actually glad you got into a scrap with Yahata before this. I know that I'm asking you to bear quite a burden. But please. Grant an old fool his wish. You're the only one I can trust to do it right. 

[Kiryu turns around and walks toward the exit of the ward.]

Mayumi: Kiryu-san! I'll do whatever it takes to make up for my deceiving you. So please… Will you please do this favor for my father?

Kiryu: Mayumi. I'm not the man you think I am. Me, your father, and that Aoyama guy… We're all yakuza. But being yakuza doesn't make us all the same. I'm far from ideal, but I'd never turn down a good man's request.

Mayumi: Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: (to Madarame) I'll pass this on.

Madarame: What? But…

Kiryu: Call it a soft spot for brats who grew up in the margins. If this is what you want, I'll make your wishes known.

Madarame: Kiryu-san…

Kiryu: I guess I wasn't alone here. How could I have been? Regardless of why, I'm glad you put a good woman at my side when I was at my lowest. Thank you for that. So I won't let Aoyama get away with this. That much I can promise you. Goodbye.

[He leaves the ward. Mayumi, barely able to hold back her tears, wants to run after him, but stops when she realizes it's pointless.]

Madarame: I’m so sorry, Mayumi. If you want to go after him, you better get moving! If that's what you want, I won't stand in your way.

[Mayumi falls face down on her father's bed.]

Madarame: Mayumi…

Mayumi: (crying) Not another word, please. This is hard enough as it is. Please… Dad!

[Mayumi keeps crying. Madarame puts his hand on her head. Meanwhile, Kiryu goes out into the city.]

Kiryu: (So Madarame wants to break up the Yamagasa Family. Better tell Yahata about this. And if I'm going to find him, I should start by tracking down his men. They were all wearing those tacky red tracksuits, if I remember right.)

Look for Yahata
[Walking the streets of Nagasugai in search of thugs from the Yamagasa family, Kiryu notices a positively familiar guy in a red plaid shirt and carrying a backpack. He is rounded up by two thugs.]

Hardened Gangster: Hey, watch where you're going!

Younger Gangster: Ow! Aniki, I… I think my shoulder's dislocated!

Kamiyama: But I barely… 

Kiryu: (This scam again… The victim looks kind of familiar, though.)

Hardened Gangster: Oh man, that's a complex break in his arm for sure. How are you going to make this right?

Kamiyama: His arm? But… I bumped into his shoulder.

Hardened Gangster: Don't give me that shit. You must've bumped into him so hard, you broke them both!

Younger Gangster: Oof… Aniki, he messed up my leg, too!

Hardened Gangster: Hang in there. I call a taxi to take us to the hospital! Okay, fatcakes, cough it up! We're gonna need 100,000 yen for the taxi and the hospital!

{100,000 yen is about $790.}

Kamiyama: What!?

Kiryu: (Better help him out.) Hey. 

Hardened Gangster: Huh? What the hell do you want?

Kiryu: Aren't you a little old to be pulling petty shakedowns like this?

Younger Gangster: Hey, you mind, pops? I have to get to the hospital, so back the fuck off.

Kiryu: You look perfectly fine to me.

Hardened Gangster: Hey, guys, let's cut pops here some slack. (laughs) After all, I think what he's saying is that he wants to pay up instead of fatty fatkins here.

Younger Gangster: Show me the money!

Kiryu: You guys just don't get it. I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson in honesty.

[He kicks their asses.]

Hardened Gangster: Ugh…

Kiryu: Now, if you really want to go to the hospital, I'd be happy to send you there.

Hardened Gangster: No, please!

Younger Gangster: I never wanted to actually break any bones!

Hardened Gangster: We're really sorry!

[They run away.]

Kiryu: You all right?

Kamiyama: Thank you. I… Kiryu-san? Is that you?

Kiryu: Wait a second…

Kamiyama: It's me, Kamiyama. You know, the guy who mods stuff over in Kamurocho?

Kiryu: (Oh, right, Kamiyama. The weapons guy. But no, I can't let him know it's me. You never know who might be listening.) You've got the wrong guy. The name's Suzuki.

Kamiyama: Huh?

Kiryu: See you.

Kamiyama: No, wait!

Kiryu: What?

Kamiyama: Suzuki-san, right? Would you mind coming by my shop?

Kiryu: Your shop?

Kamiyama: Yes. You see, in addition to Kamurocho and Downtown Ryukyu, I've also set up shop in Nagasugai. I'm sure someone like you will find something useful there. So how about it Kiry—I mean, Suzuki-san?

Kiryu: (Kamiyama's shop might prove useful if trouble comes looking for me. Hope I don't have to use it.) All right, lead the way.

Kamiyama: Heh… Hehe. Right this way, Suzuki-san.

Kiryu: ……

Kamiyama: This is the Nagasu branch of Kamiyama Works. I, uh, don't have all that much merchandise, but I'm thinking I will gradually add more.

Kiryu: Okay.

Kamiyama: I specialize in weapons. I can do all sorts of things with weapons, as long as you pay. I sell new weapons, and I can fix busted weapons, too. I'm trying to go national, but I'm short on funds. I'm even having trouble sourcing materials for the main Kamurocho shop. If you don't mind, could you donate materials you might not need? If I get more funds, I can work on developing new weapons and gear.

Kiryu: Got it. If I find something, I’ll pass it on.

Kamiyama: Thanks, If there's anything I can help with, don't hesitate to ask.

[Kiryu leaves the store and finds a strange car on the street… It stands out brightly among other cars. It is a sports car painted in shiny purple metallic.]

Kiryu: (Huh? What's with that car?)

Wada: (approaches) Oh? What's the Spangled Meteor doing around here?

Kiryu: Wada-san… You know about this car?

Wada: Why, is this the first time you've seen it?

Kiryu: It is. There something special about it?

Wada: Well sure. The lady who drives this sexy piece of machinery is in charge of the Vixen Zeroes. They call her the Spangled Meteor.

Kiryu: And what's the Vixen Zeroes?

Wada: They say they're a group of gorgeous women who can outspeed anyone they challenge. Wish they'd drive up on me someday!

Kiryu: So they're essentially an all-girl street racing team?

Wada: According to the stories, yeah. But I’ve never heard of anyone who's actually seen their faces.

Kiryu: Then they may not be gorgeous at all.

Wada: Haha, that's about the size of it. Guess you could say it's one of those urban legends. Oh, and apparently, the only way to see them is to beat them in a race. Interestingly enough, the Vixen Zeroes are usually the ones who initiate the challenges. If you lose, they just speed off. But if you win? You catch a glimpse of true beauty.

Kiryu: But if nobody's ever seen them in person, does that mean they're undefeated?

Wada: Who knows? All I've heard are rumors. Sure makes a good story. though, don't you think?

Kiryu: Heh. I guess you're right.

[He continues to search the city for the Yamagashi gang.]

Man: There you are, Kazuma Kiryu. I found you at last. Or is it Taichi Suzuki you're calling yourself now?

Kiryu: Who are you?

Man: I'm Ren Higashino. I'm in the qualifiers for the Victory Road.

Kiryu: I see. So you're the one spreading rumors about me.

Higashino: I didn't mean to blow your cover, but it's a bit late for apologies now, I guess. I never expected to find you in a town like this. I saw you fighting in Kamurocho once. The power you displayed motivated me to up my game. Now you owe me a chance to test my mettle.

Kiryu: I don't see why I owe you anything.

Higashino: You made me into what I am today, Kazuma Kiryu.

Kiryu: What if I said you've got the wrong guy?

Higashino: There are plenty of others like me out there, you know! You think you can run from all of us!?

Kiryu: ……

Higashino: Don't try to tell me you're not who I think you are. I know how to find out. I can't let you run off without giving me a shot. I don't care if you're game or not. You lit a fire in me… and now it's time to stoke it!

[Kiryu fights Ren Higashino and wins without much effort.]

Higashino: Man… You sure live up to your reputation!

Tournament Staff: Excellent performance, “Suzuki-san.” Shall we assume this means you are willing to take part in the Victory Road competition?

Kiryu: ……

Higashino: Don't turn down the offer, Kiryu-san! I can still get stronger, I know it! I’ll train up more and take you on again! Come on! Give us a goal to aspire to! This isn't just for me. It's what all of the guys inspired by your strength want.

Kiryu: ……

Higashino: You like a good challenge yourself, don't you? I know you do. I could feel it in your fists, A frenzied fight really gets your blood pumping!

Kiryu: Heh… Fine, you win.

Higashino: Then you're on board!?

Kiryu: Yeah. But keep things on the down-low in the future. My livelihood is at stake here.

Tournament Staff: I wish you good luck with your battles, Kiryu-san. We're looking forward to seeing you in the Victory Road finals.

[Suddenly Kiryu hears a man thinking aloud.]

Unnerved Man: Huh. Wonder if they were Yahata Family…

Kiryu: Sorry, did you just say Yahata? Did you see them?

Unnerved Man: Pretty sure, yeah. They were wearing those awful red tracksuits and everythin'.

Kiryu: Where were they?

Unnerved Man: Standin' smack-dab in the middle of Nagasu Boulevard. Can't say why.

Kiryu: Got it, thanks.

Unnerved Man: Hey, you aren't thinkin' about goin' after them, are ya? That's a one-way street to a hospital bed, if y'ask me.

[Kiryu finds some tracksuit men on Nagasu Boulevard.]

Kiryu: Are you Yahata's men?

Yamagasa Family Member: And what if we are? Who's askin’?

Kiryu: I've got business with your boss. Where can I find him?

Yamagasa Family Member: You? Why would some civilian wanna… No, this guy's gotta be Tojo Clan! Hey! We got one of those Tojo pricks here! Let's bash his face in!

[Kiryu beats up Yahata’s underlings.]

Kiryu: Just so you know, I'm not Tojo Clan. Just a regular civilian. Now tell me, where can I find your boss?

Yamagasa Family Member: Urgh, I dunno. Haven't seen him since yesterday. He went in to HQ, but never came back out.

Kiryu: Dammit, he better still be alive. Guess I'll have to find someone who knows what they're talking about.

[He approaches two old women talking to each other.]

Oblivious Tourist: Who are those people in the red tracksuits?

Unconcerned Tourist: There must be some kind of event going on. One of those hero shows for kids, maybe. It's just a costume.

Kiryu: Excuse me. Did you say you saw some people wearing red tracksuits?

Oblivious Tourist: Yes, that's right. Is there a festival going on?

Kiryu: Hardly. They're yakuza, so you should keep your distance. Can you tell me where you saw them?

Unconcerned Tourist: Yakuza!? Oh my! I did wonder why they looked so scary. So it wasn't a kid's event, then?

Oblivious Tourist: They were on the east end of… I think it's called New Street? Modern Street? Something like that.

Kiryu: I’ll figure it out. Thanks.

Unconcerned Tourist: Not a problem!

[Kiryu finds another group of tracksuit yakuza.]

Kiryu: You're with the Yahata Family, right? Mind telling me where your boss is?

Yahata's Underling: Who the hell are you? Y'think I'm just gonna spill my guts to some nobody off the street?

Kiryu: I’m doing a favor for your patriarch. It's urgent.

Yahata's Underling: Madarame? Hold up, what's the deal here?

Yahata's Underling: Hey, this guy's gotta be one of them Tojo goons! Let's take his ass out!

Kiryu: Here we go again.

[He wipes the asphalt with their faces.]

Kiryu: Now then. Tell me where Yahata is.

Yahata's Underling: Grr… You're not gettin' a goddamn thing outta me!

Kiryu: This isn't a joke. I'm trying to stop a war with the Tojo Clan here.

Yahata's Underling: Yeah, well what's the point of bein' yakuza if y'can't fight when it really matters? Besides, I ain't got a clue where the boss is at. Same goes for Patriarch Madarame. Whole damn family's goin' down the gutter fast. 

Kiryu: Guess someone else will have to tell me what I want to know. (So Yahata's own family doesn't even know where he is. Gotta keep looking.)

[He approaches the passersby again.]

Woman Who Wants to Leave: Let's go home. I'm telling ya, it's dangerous.

Man Trying to Look Tough: Oh, c'mon. It's the Yahata Family! Y'don't get to see real yakuza every day. Let's go look!

Woman Who Wants to Leave: But what if they come after us!?

Kiryu: Did you just say something about the Yahata Family?

Man Trying to Look Tough: Eep! Please don't hurt me!

Kiryu: Calm down. I just want to know where they were.

Woman Who Wants to Leave: On the east side of town, way down at the end of Chikuzengawa Street.

Kiryu: Got it. Thanks.

Man Trying to Look Tough: …Phew, that just about scared the soul outta me.

[Kiryu finds another one of the Yahata family standing on the corner.]

Kiryu: Hey.

Yahata's Lackey: What the shit? You're the asshole who came stormin' through our HQ yesterday.

Kiryu: That's right. Now tell me where I can find Yahata. We need to talk.

Yahata's Lackey: Heh. I knew you'd say that. I hear y’been snoopin' around town lookin' for him.

Kiryu: That's right. So? Where is he?

Yahata's Lackey: It's my turn for questions first. Why d'ya gotta see him so bad?

Kiryu: I made a promise to Madarame. I told him I wouldn't let Aoyama and the Tojo Clan have the run of the place. That I'd protect Nagasugai and the Yamagasa Family.

Yahata's Lackey: Y'sayin' you talked to the patriarch?

Kiryu: I did.

Yahata's Lackey: Hmph. N’ why should I believe ya?

Kiryu: You'll understand once I see Yahata.

Yahata's Lackey: Sorry, but the boss got real hurt yesterday. Can't just let ya waltz into our hideout. Guy like ya could be workin' for the Tojo Clan fer all I know.

Kiryu: A hideout, huh? So that's where I'll find Yahata.

Yahata's Lackey: Not if I can help it! You ain't leavin' here alive!

[Kiryu beats him up and he runs away. Kiryu gives chase and kicks Yahata's man a few times until he stops.]

Yahata's Lackey: Urgh, god damn!

Kiryu: Listen. I used to be yakuza, just like you. So I get that you're trying to protect your boss. But I want what's best for this town. Same as you. And the only way I can keep this town safe is by talking to Yahata and stopping the Tojo Clan. So please. Tell me where he is.

Yahata's Lackey: The hideout's crawlin' with men, all there to guard the boss. Y'set foot in there, yer as good as dead.

Kiryu: Just tell me where it is, and I'll handle it. Even if I have to knock sense into every last one of them.

Yahata's Lackey: That so? Hahaha! Ain't many in Nagasu with those kinda balls. Fine then. It's all on you. You’ll find the boss's hideout around the middle of Suzukake Lane.

Kiryu: Got it.

Yahata's Lackey: And hey… Good luck. All o’ Nagasugai's countin' on ya.

Kiryu: I won't let you down.

[He approaches a building with 西尾ビルデ ング (Nishio Building) smeared with paint and damaged.]

Kiryu: So this is where Yahata's camping out.

Lookout: Who the hell’re you?

Kiryu: Doesn't matter. I heard I could find Yahata here.

Lookout: What? The captain's—Er, I mean, I never heard that name before!

Kiryu: Sounds like I’ve got the right place. Guess I'll just show myself in.

[Bypasses the lookout and walks to the entrance.]

Lookout: Hey! You can't go in there. Shit! (pulls out his phone) We got trouble. Yeah. Guy in a trenchcoat.

Look for Yahata 2
[Kiryu kneads his fists and prepares to fight. After a few dozen battles, he finds the room where the top of the Yahata family is hiding.]

Yamagata Family Member: Hey, it's that asshole!

[He and the others pull out their guns and point them at Kiryu.]

Yahata: Easy, boys.

Yamagata Family Member: But cap, he's…!

Yahata: I said stand down, y'buncha morons! (to Kiryu) Y'got business here?

[Kiryu hands him the letter without a word.]

Yahata: What's that?

Kiryu: Word from Madarame. It's a declaration dissolving the Yamagasa Family.

[Yahara reads the letter.]

Yahata: Figures. It's just like the old man to pull this. 

Kiryu: Madarame seems to think you're on a collision course with the Tojo Clan. He wrote this to protect you. And entrusted it to me.

Yahata: Oh yeah?

[He hands the letter back to Kiryu.]

Kiryu: What, not gonna tear it up?

Yahata: We're only livin' on this green earth to serve Patriarch Madarame. It don't even matter what happens to the Yamagasa Family. We'd avenge the boss either way. He's all we got.

Kiryu: If it's revenge you want, come and get it.

Yahata: I ain't that dense. It was that Aoyama fucker from the Tojo Clan who knifed the patriarch. Figured it out when HQ got blown to shit. You ain't the type to stoop that low.

Kiryu: So let me get this straight. 'Even if the Yamagasa crumbles… You still want revenge on Aoyama?

Yahata: Damn straight. This ain't about turf or protocols or relations anymore. It's one-hundred percent pure yakuza justice.

Kiryu: All right, then.

[He tears up Madarama's letter and throws it in front of Yahata.]

Yahata: The shit? What'd ya do that for!?

Kiryu: The Yamagasa Family isn't disbanding. There's something I need you to do.

Yahata: Y'givin' us orders?

Kiryu: When I first came to Nagasu, it felt almost exactly like Kamurocho. For better or worse, the Yamagasa Family keeps this town in balance. If the Yamagasa is out of the picture, other groups are just going to muscle in. Wouldn't be great for business.

Yahata: What business?

Kiryu: I don't really look the part, but I drive a taxi in town. So I can't let the Yamagasa just fade away. You still have a job to do here. Get this city back on its feet.

Yahata: Huh!? Y'ain't makin' a lick o' sense! Keep stickin' yer nose where it don't belong, and I'll chop it off!

Kiryu: That's the right attitude. But you'll need more than that. If you make a run at the Tojo Clan now, you'd all end up leaving in body bags.

Yahata: What'd you say!?

Kiryu: If you still want to go after Aoyama, I won't stand in your way. But first… You'll need to see if you can get through me.

Yahata: Huh!? What're ya smokin'!?

Kiryu: (raises index finger upwards) One hit. That's all it'll take to floor you.

Yahata: Y'may have beaten me once, but I ain't lost a rematch. First round was just a warm-up. This time I'm puttin' ya in the ground fer sure.

Kiryu: Then shut up and show me. I'm ready when you are.

[Kiryu technically dodges all of Yahata's punches and puts him on the floor with one punch.]

Yahata's Underling: C-Captain!

Yahata: (barely standing) Get back! This is between me and him. You stay outta this. Dammit…

Kiryu: Don't take it too hard. You can't be fighting at your best after that explosion earlier.

Yahata: I know that, asshole. But if I don't do nothin', the Tojo Clan's gonna rip Fukuoka out from under us. I gotta get back at Aoyama for this, no matter what it takes.

Kiryu: Like I said, I won't let the Yamagasa Family fall apart.

Yahata: But how're y'gonna do that?

Kiryu: I’ll crush the Tojo Clan. Every last one of them down in Fukuoka.

Yahata: (shocked) Y’what!?

[Meanwhile, Aoyama is riding his limousine through Nagasugai. Someone calls and his assistant answers the phone.]

Assistant: Acting Chairman. It's from the Yamagasa captain, Yahata.

Aoyama: Yahata? So he survived.

Assistant: Do you want me to hang up?

Aoyama: He's after a deal. Give it. This is Aoyama. Yes. The Tojo Clan has no intention of cutting a deal with you. Our houses are in open war. Are you sure that's wise? I'm not sure I understand.

Yahata: (cheekily) I said, we're kickin' this war into top gear! Yer gonna pay fer what ya did to the boss! Might as well make a spectacle outta it. Tomorrow night. Hakata pier, Warehouse 27. Ya got that? I'm lookin' forward to cavin' yer damn face in. (hungs up) That good enough, Kiryu-san?

Assistant: What did they say, Acting Chairman?

Aoyama: They want an old-fashioned battle. Even gave us a time and place. A full-on brawl at the pier tomorrow night.

Assistant: What, like some afterschool fist fight? Don't let them get under your skin, Acting Chairman. It may even be a trap.

[He throws the phone right in his assistant's face.]

Aoyama: Not showing would play right into their hand! The mighty Tojo Clan can't be seen backing down from these backwater hicks. Once we have control of their turf, we'll need our reputation to demand respect.

Assistant: Apologies, sir.

Aoyama: Put the word out to everyone still down in Fukuoka. That sworn brother of mine may finally have a use, too.

[Back to Nishio Building…]

Yahata: That do the trick, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Yeah. Perfect.

Yahata: Why tomorrow night, though? Those dirtbags ain't stupid. We give 'em a chance to regroup, we ain't got a hope in hell of comin' outta there alive.

Kiryu: I'm aware. But I need some time to sort a few things out.

Yahata: Those complications y'were talkin' about before I called up Aoyama?

Kiryu: Yeah. A lot of people here helped me out not knowing who I was. I have to set things straight so I don't make things worse for them.

Yahata: Bet they'd practically shit 'emselves if they found out yer the Dragon of Dojima ‘imself. Gotta wonder why the boss never told us.

Kiryu: Patriarch Madarame was just protecting me. And Daigo, too.

Yahata: Yeah, he helps out a little too much I reckon. Maybe he really ain't cut out for yakuza life. Heh. We're always the ones getting shafted for it anyhow.

Kiryu: Well, people like me and Madarame always seem to end up dragged into some mess or another. I guess that's just our lot in life.

Yahata: Guess so. Anyway, I’ll go round up what's left of our boys and prep fer tomorrow night. How ‘bout you, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: I’ll meet you at the pier when it's time. If that works for you.

[He leaves the building.]

Kiryu: (It's only right Nakajima-san knows the truth, with the impact this'll have on him, I should go to the office and settle things.)

Man in White: Come one, come all! Witness the most revolutionary technological marvel of our time! Step right up and try your hand at IF8!

Kiryu: (Hm? What's that all about?)

Man in White: Try the latest and greatest sensation in all of arcade gaming! We'll be at the parking lot in southwest Nagasugai for a limited time only!

Kiryu: (Sounds like some kind of event, Maybe l go check it out later.)

[He goes to Nagace Taxi.]

Kiryu: (Nakajima-san gave me another lease on life. I can't let anything happen to him. Time to settle things here.)

[He enters the building.]

Nakajima: Yer quittin' on me!?

Kiryu: Yes, sir. I don't want to cause you any more trouble.

Nakajima: What's eatin' ya?

Kiryu: You've known all along, haven't you? That my name isn't actually Suzuki.

Nakajima: Well, yeah.

Kiryu: The truth is, I'm an ex-yakuza. I used to be in a group called the Tojo Clan. Eventually I made a clean start, and went on to run an orphanage in Okinawa. Then I had to leave, and ended up here in Fukuoka. That's when I met you.

Nakajima: Hm. 

Kiryu: But now, war is about to break out here in Fukuoka between the Tojo Clan and the Yamagasa Family.

Nakajima: War!?

Kiryu: I have to stop that from happening.

Nakajima: Suzuki-san…

Kiryu: No matter how things turn out, it would be a huge problem for you if word got out that I worked here. Meaning I need to quit before that happens.

Nakajima: So that's how it is, huh?

Kiryu: (bows) I’m sorry it had to be this way.

Nakajima: Yeah, so am I. ‘Cause you ain't goin' nowhere.

Kiryu: But Chief.

Nakajima: Look. You're sayin' you wanna quit 'cause you're afraid of hurtin' the company, right?

Kiryu: That’s right.

Nakajima: Well, you're goin' about this all wrong. You don't hafta leave. Yer part of the family now, Suzuki-san. I want the people workin' for me to live life true to themselves, without holdin' anything back.

Kiryu: Chief…

Nakajima: I could tell you were no ordinary guy right from the get-go. Truth be told, I had a feelin' somethin' like this would happen one day. Bear in mind, I'm runnin'a business here. I can't afford to lose a good man for no good reason. Now I don't need to know any details. Just be sure to come back to us, no matter what. Y’got that?

Kiryu: Nakajima-san…

Nakajima: Right! Now that that's settled, you better take care of any loose ends before the big task ahead!

Kiryu: Yes, sir.

Nakajima: Oh, and y'can take one of our cars when you go and put an end to this war of yours. Just come talk to me.

Kiryu: (bows) Thank you, Chief.

Nakajima: Don't mention it.

[Kiryu leaves the station.]

Kiryu: (The people of this town have been good to me. I’ve got to stop this war for their sake, too. I should take care of any unfinished business, then go and see the chief.)

[Some time later Kiryu returns to the station.]

Nakajima: If ya still got things to do, now's the time to do 'em. Or were ya headin' to the pier right now?

I'm going. ✓
Not yet.

Kiryu: I'm going.

Nakajima: Be careful out there, Suzuki-san. Get back in one piece, y'hear?

Kiryu: I will. Thanks, Chief.

[In the next scene, dozens of expensive cars of the Totjo Clan drive up to the pier. A good hundred people from the Yamagasa family are already standing there. Tojo Clan thugs get out of the cars. They are holding bats and other weapons.]

Yahara: (loudly) Yo! Where's that bitch-ass Aoyama at? Don't tell me he chickened out!

Aoyama’s Assistant: You worthless rednecks aren't worth the acting chairman's time!

[Aoyama and Watase are holed up in one of the cars.]

Watase: What, you ain't gonna join your boys, brother?

Aoyama: Of course not. The general doesn't dirty his hands doing a soldier's job.

Watase: You're missin' out. Nothin' gets the adrenaline pumpin' like punchin' guys.

Aoyama: I'm afraid I'm not like you and Kiryu-san. Brutality gives me no pleasure.

Watase: Then why'd ya drag me all the way out here? I thought ya needed backup.

Aoyama: Call it an insurance policy. In case a certain someone shows up.

Watase: Who're ya talkin'?

Aoyama: Well, looks like they're ready. Sit back and enjoy the fireworks.

Aoyama’s Assistant: Time's up. Let's start this thing!

[Right in between, the high beamer lights come on. A cab pulls out of the warehouse. Kiryu gets out of it.]

Aoyama’s Assistant: Aren't you…

Kiryu: Sorry… But this fight's mine.

Aoyama’s Assistant: (in shock and awe) Fourth Chairman!?

Kiryu: Not anymore I'm not. Now I'm just a driver, working for Nagasu Taxi Company.

Aoyama’s Assistant: And you've come to lend the Tojo Clan your aid, sir? It's truly an honor!

Kiryu: I'm here to help, all right. But not you. You punks don't have the slightest idea what it means to be yakuza. So I'm gonna put you on the right path.

Aoyama’s Assistant: What do you mean?

[Aoyama and Watase walk in.]

Kiryu: Aoyama.

Aoyama: So Madarame came begging you to rescue his helpless family, did he?

Kiryu: Madarame is still alive and strong. You failed to destroy the Yamagasa Family.

Aoyama: (smirks) For someone who made it so far, you really are quite imperceptive. I never wanted to kill Madarame. All I needed was to ruffle up his feathers a bit. That was the plan all along.

Kiryu: What?

Aoyama: Did the bomb not give it away? If I wanted to use lethal force, I wouldn't use a half-measure. I’d have guaranteed the deed was done.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Aoyama: That little display of fireworks was simply the pretext I needed to fight the Yamagasa Family. Besides, having Madarame die would be very inconvenient for me, at least until Chairman Dojima turns up.

Kiryu: Why?

Aoyama: I know for a fact the two of them had something worked out. So I needed proper bait to lure out the chairman.

Kiryu: I get it. You're using Madarame to get to Daigo.

Aoyama: As far as Chairman Dojima's concerned, I intend to track him down as soon as possible. Now then, I think it's time we began, Are you ready, Fourth Chairman?

Kiryu: I need to check one thing first.

Aoyama: And what might that be?

Kiryu: If I take you all down myself, then this isn't a war between the families, right?

Aoyama: Huh? I really don't know what you're implying.

Kiryu: I meant what I said. If I take down every one of you myself, it's just a fight between a civilian and some yakuza. Not a war between families. Am I wrong?

Aoyama: That's absurd! Have you lost your mind?

Yahata: Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: Yahata! You stay out of this. I promise, I won't leave a single one standing.

Yahata: But…

Kiryu: Like I said, I won't let your family fade away.

Aoyama: Hahahaha! What nonsense. You must've taken too many hits to the head.

Kiryu: You won't be laughing soon.

Aoyama: So you're going to take on an army by yourself because you think you can stop a war!? You don't stand a chance!

Kiryu: (Well see about that.)

Aoyama: Kiryu-san. The times have changed! A war isn't about who locks fists with whom anymore. You old timers never change. (laughs)

[Watase punches him, hard.]

Watase: Watch your fuckin' mouth.

Aoyama: Watase!?

Watase: I accept your conditions! If Kiryu-han takes out every one of these Tojo chumps, then there's no war with the Yamagasa.

Aoyama: You can't do that, Watase!

Watase: I'm the captain of the Omi Alliance, and patriarch of the Watase Family. Ya really wanna challenge me, brother? All right, let's get this shit started! I'll be bearin' witness to this brawl!

Aoyama: (to his men) What are you waiting for!? Don't be scared because he's the fourth chairman! Get him!

Kiryu: He's right. No need to hold back. Now if you want to die… bring it!

[Kiryu fights a good hundred of man armed with bats, katanas, tanto, golf clubs and bare fist. Despite the huge difference in numbers, each individual fighter of the Tojo Clan is quite weak and poses little threat to the battle-hardened Kiryu. They try their best and still lose. Kiryu finishes the last one and breathes heavily. Everyone in the Yamagasa family looks at him with horror and admiration.]

Yahara: What the shit…

Aoyama: How!?

[He pulls out a gun.]

Aoyaman: I'm done playing with you.

[Watase grabs Aoyama’s arm and lowers it.]

Aoyama: Brother! What do you think you're doing!?

Watase: Can't have ya firin' that thing and shamin' my rep as a witness. Ya don't wanna tarnish my name, do ya?

Aoyama: Come on! This wasn't the deal! You're the one who said you want to take Kiryu out! Right, brother!?

Watase: (twist Aoyama’s arm) I ain't your soldier. When I fight him, it'll be on my terms, ya fuckwit!

[He slaps Aoyama and he falls on the ground.]

Aoyama: Damn you!

[Kiryu grabs Aoyama and punches him like he was a training doll. Again and again.]

Aoyama: This isn't what I heard! They said you never kill. That you're merciful.

Kiryu: Who told you that?

Aoyama: Well…

Kiryu: I said, who told you that?

Aoyama: Some other Tojo men.

Kiryu: Whatever you heard… 

[He swings for another punch, but hits the car glass next to Aoyama's head, shattering it.]

Kiryu: I can hide from my past all I want. But no matter how much I hate it… I'll always be yakuza. Being clever only gets you so far in this business. Just remember. This is your last warning.

[Kiryu walks away.]

Aoyama: Why me? Why me of all people? Had I known this would happen, I never would have agreed.

[Watase quickly walks up to him and lifts him off the ground.]

Watase: (loudly) Quit your whimperin'! You wanna helm the Tojo Clan!? Then you're gonna have to grow a pair! Or are ya determined to disappoint me!? What do ya got to say, brother!?

Aoyama: I did as I was told. All I had to do was lure Kiryu-san out of hiding.

Watase: Say what? Who told ya that!? Who's givin' ya orders!?

Aoyama: It was… your…

[Someone shoots him in the head. Watase's white suit is splattered with blood.]

Watase: Brother… Hey, bro!

???: You talk too much, Acting Chairman.

Kiryu: It's you. Morinaga!

[Morinaga points his gun at Kiryu.]

Morinaga: I hadn't planned on seeing you again like this, Fourth Chairman.

Kiryu: Morinaga!

[Kiryu runs towards him and Morinaga shoots. The bullet passes within an inch of Kiryu's cheek.]

Morinaga: Not another step! Next one's through your brain.

Kiryu: What's your game here? How long have you been betraying Daigo?

Morinaga: Betrayal, you say? The chairman's the one who ran off, left his men to fend for themselves. If you ask me, that's the real betrayal.

Kiryu: And Aoyama shooting you. Was that all part of the act!?

Morinaga: My job in this was to get you where you needed to be. Just like Chairman Madarame, I was prepared for every scenario.

Kiryu: Then you and Aoyama were in league. Why take him out?

Morinaga: No one likes a yakuza with loose lips. Just a few punches and he was ready to spill all our dirty secrets.

Kiryu: What secrets?

[Morinaga smirks and walks away.]

Kiryu: Stop, Morinaga!

Morinaga: What is it? I'm not going to tell you what I'm doing, if that's what you want.

Kiryu: I don't care what you're doing! I only need to know one thing! Where's Aizawa? Aizawa's not the kind of guy for all this backstabbing. If he'd known you'd turned on Daigo… He would have told me, no matter the circumstances. So answer me, Morinaga. I want the truth. Where is Aizawa?

Morinaga: He truly was one of the good guys. But he knew too much. Too much to turn the other way.

Morinaga: No… You didn't!

Morinaga: He's up on Mount Inuboe. Six feet under. I buried him with my own hands. He deserved that much.

Kiryu: Morinaga… You piece of…!

[He rushes toward Morinaga blinded by rage.]

Morinaga: I said, don't move! Stop! Stop, damn you!

[But Kiryu keeps running anyway and Morinaga shoots him in the leg. Watase picks up the falling Kiryu.]

Watase: Leave him! Now ain't the time!

Morinaga: There's a lot more I have to do before I die. And I can't have you kicking the bucket just yet either, Fourth Chairman.

Kiryu: Morinaga!

Morinaga: You'll find your answers up in Tokyo. I'll be waiting, Kiryu-san.

[He drives away.]

Two days later
Nagasugai

[Kiryu stands by the embankment and ponders.]

Serizawa: Two days since the big scrap…  And you're back on the clock. Helluva work ethic.

Kiryu: You again?

Serizawa: Heard you put on quite a show. 

Kiryu: Don't know what you're talking about.

Serizawa: (smirks) It's no use hidin' things from me. So, how's the leg?

[Kiryu turns away and tries to light a cigarette but his lighter doesn't work.]

Serizawa: I got ya.

[They smoke together for a minute.]

Serizawa: So you know, Watase headed back to Kansai this morning. Heard he stopped by the police morgue on his way. Wanted to light some incense for Aoyama, apparently. Crazy. He didn't even realize Aoyama was tryin' to use him. Bit of a moron, huh? Kinda surprisin' that the Omi keeps old-school guys like him around. Almost makes ne proud of ‘em.

[Kiryu turns to him.]

Serizawa: Forget it. I know that's strange comin' from me. He should be the sharpest thorn in my side… Man, guess I'm goin' soft.

Kiryu: Would you say you two are close?

Serizawa: Hell nah. But when ya been on the force long as I have. Even your enemy starts makin' ya sentimental. You musta had a cop or two ya came to see eye to eye with. That's kinda how me n' Watase are. Oh, by the way… Watase told the local detectives to give you his regards.

Kiryu: To me?

Serizawa: Yeah, said he'd settle the Omi side. Then settle the score in Tokyo. You're goin' too, right?

[Kiryu puts out his cigarette and walks away.]

Serizawa: Before you go. They found a body on Mount Inuboe this morning. The face was pretty jacked up so they haven't confirmed an ID yet. But there was a Tojo pin on the lapel. Ya sure you can stay outta this? Crucial time for a crucial guy like Daigo Dojima to be missin'. You may be the only one who can sail the Tojo through this storm.

[Kiryu sits in his taxi.]

Kiryu: If you need to go somewhere, I'd be glad to give you a lift. But those are the only directions I'll be taking from you. The path I walk… is mine to decide.

Serizawa: I get ya. Have it your way. But you may wanna flip to the news before ya decide. I think you and I are gonna be gettin' to know each other real good soon. Later.

[He leaves. Kiryu watches him, then turns on the radio.]

Radio: Again, our top story today is the Sapporo shooting incident early yesterday morning. Hokkaido Police have determined… The victim was a senior member of Kanto's organized crime syndicate, the Tojo Clan. He's been identified as Goro Majima. Details were released at an impromptu press conference. Given the victim's status as a member of the largest crime syndicate in Kanto… Hokkaido Police are taking extra precautions to determine the circumstances of Goro Majima's death. They also plan to work alongside the Tokyo Metropolitan police in the investigation. We go now to the weather. Here's our meteorologist, Hayashida-san. Hayashida-san?

[Kiryu punches the wheel. The deafening honking of the car horn is heard. Serizawa hears it, but does not turn around. Next scene. Kiryu washes in the shower in his apartment, or rather stands under the jets of water and reflects. Then he puts on his trademark gray jacket, gray pants, and purple shirt. He walks to the exit of his apartment and notices the upside-down picture. On it he sees a screenshot of Yakuza 3, or rather a picture of the kids from Morning Glory Orphanage.]

Kiryu: Sorry, Haruka.

[He puts the picture on the drawer and leaves the apartment.]

[PART 1 COMPLETED]

PART 2 TAIGA SAEJIMA
December 2010
Kamurocho

[Taiga and Majima eat yakiniku in a restaurant. Taiga eats like a starving bear and Majima just smokes and watches him.]

Majima: Why're we in this dump? There's gotta be a million better BBQ joints than this! Azabu, Roppongi... Hell, probably down the block! But ya got us feastin' in this ghost town instead.

Saejima: Less whinin', more eatin'.

Majima: Your last meal on the outside and it's in freakin' Kamurocho. Our usual spot at that. Ain't a more pathetic sight.

Saejima: What's so wrong with it? Now c'mon, eat up before it burns. Hey, lady! 'Nother plate o' tripe!

Waitress: Coming up!

Majima: Don't got the stomach I used to. Fatty meat just tastes like shit now. My days of scarfin' down a slab of kalbi on a tub of rice are looong gone. No goin' back in time though, huh? Back to when every day felt worth livin'.

Waitress: Here's your tripe.

Saejima: Why ya bein such a sack? Here, eat this.

Majima: The flyin' shit? Ya burnt it to a crisp!

Saejima: You n' me aren't too different from that tripe there, y'know. Ya overcook any ol' meat, it'll get way too tough to eat. But not tripe. Gettin' burned just makes it better. Gotta burn it over n' over, 'til it's black as night. Only way to bring out the flavor.

[Majima tries the burned meat.]

Majima: Hey, no shit.

[Taiga puts a piece of fresh meat on Majima's plate.]

Saejima: All right, how's this compare?

Majima: The hell, man? It's practically raw! (spits) That's pure trash.

Saejima: 'Exactly. Few things worse than half-cooked tripe. We gotta keep gettin' burned, you n' me. No matter how much we try n' gussy it up, we're yakuza to the very core. Worst cut o' meat there is.

Majima: Kinda like this trashy tripe here, huh?

Saejima: Yup. That's why we gotta hop back on the fire. Tripe that ain't burned through don't even deserve the plate it comes on. But once ya char it nice n' black... That's when it takes on some meanin'. Yakuza these days forget that. 

Majima: So what, that's why you're goin' back behind bars?

Saejima: I made a promise to Kiryu. Told him I'd drag the Tojo outta the gutter. If it'll help, I'm ready to take a year or two. Burn myself blacker than ever.

Majima: Bro.

Saejima: But while I'm gone, you're gonna have to keep the place runnin' smooth. Give our young chef the support he needs.

Majima: You're talkin' Daigo-chan.

Saejima: He's got all the ingredients. But... the guys surroundin' him? Nothin' but half-cooked trash.

Majima: Ain't that the truth. The Tojo Clan's at a record high, bigger than ever. But barely any of 'em know war. Nothin' but a bunch of half-assed fakers. Just watch what happens if war with the Omi strikes. They'll scatter like roaches.

Saejima: No problem actin' the part to make a livin'. But y'know, ya won't last in this business if you're just in it for the cash. It all comes down to strength. Me n' you gotta show that by example. Ya ask me, that's the whole point of us old-timers stickin' around.

Majima: Guess so. All right! I'm gonna eat 'til I pop!

[He wants to take a piece of burnt meat with his chopsticks, but Taiga takes it first.]

Saejima: Don't grab it quick enough, n' it'll turn to cinders. Ya let this trash burn too long, it might as well not even exist.

Majima: The fuck, ya gimme the big sermon then pull that shit? Yo, waitress! Three plates of your finest tripe! Naw, make it ten! Plate that trash up!

[They leave the restaurant when they are full. By the way, it's one of Kamurocho's most elite restaurants with a red carpet at the entrance.]

Majima: Ahhh, that was good shit! Couldn't shove down another bite if I wanted. So, what’re ya doin' now?

Saejima: They're comin' for me tonight. Guess I’ll take one last stroll around town.

Majima: Now there's a hell of an idea. Ya oughta have a good time before goin' away.  So get on out there n' live it up.

Saejima: Think I will.

Majima: Oh yeah. Stop in n' see me before they haul you in, so I can give ya a proper send-off. I'll be waitin' at the usual place!

Saejima: Where?

Majima: Y’know! What's the one place we’re always pallin’ around at?

Saejima: Heh. The battin' center, then.

Majima: So whaddya say? One last chance at the plate before ya get benched?

Saejima: Yeah, sure.

[Majima leaves.]

Saejima: (Time to wave this town goodbye. Might wanna drop by New Serena first, tell 'em I'm goin'.)

Yakuza: Hey, you.

Saejima: Can I help you?

Yakuza: ……

Saejima: Ya got cotton shoved in your ears? I asked you a question.

Yakuza: I'm sick of you and your whole tough guy shtick.

Saejima: Ya gonna explain that, or can I go? Got places to be.

Yakuza: Not so fast. You're the reason my career's gone down the shitter.

Saejima: N’ how's that, exactly?

Yakuza: Don't play dumb! If your criminal ass didn't come waltzing back into the Tojo Clan, I’d have been lieutenant by now!

Saejima: Huh. So you're Tojo, too.

Yakuza: Ever since you filled that empty exec seat, we've been getting screwed. Over and over and over again! First our casino got busted, then the cops raided the family office. Bye bye, main revenue stream! Most of our boys ended up scurrying off not long after. Rats who can see the ship is sinking fast. So what's left of us now? We got no money, no men. Hell, we're barely even a family. 

Saejima: Tough break.

Yakuza: Tough break? Is that all you have to say!?

Saejima: Lemme ask ya somethin'. When things started goin' south, what did you do?

Yakuza: Huh?

Saejima: Your casino got busted. Ya got raided by the cops. Your family fell on its ass quicker than ya can count to ten. I wanna know, how'd ya respond?

Yakuza: I, well… What was I supposed to do? I can't turn that shit around all by myself!

Saejima: There. Now do ya see why you ain't a leader?

Yakuza: What?

Saejima: Sure, maybe my comin' back tossed a few pebbles in your path. But if a pebble or two are gonna make ya fall flat on your face, how're ya ever gonna climb the mountains life's got in store? So yeah, ya might slip a bit here n' there. But what really matters is how ya respond after.

Yakuza: You little…

Saejima: If the family means that much to ya, you gotta be willin' to give your life on keepin' it afloat. Else you just ain't cut out for the yakuza, pal.

Yakuza: I don't need a fucking lecture from you! You know what? I'm sick of your shit! Get ready to die!

Saejima: Easy there. I'm skippin' town for good after tonight. Let me enjoy my last evenin' in peace.

Yakuza: No way, man! Not after the sermon you just made us sit through!

[Strong as Siberian bear Taiga crushes the yakuza.]

Washed-up Yakuza: Dammit... You're too freaking strong!

Saejima: Ya want my advice? Find a new line of work. You'll be happier for it.

Washed-up Yakuza: Hah… Hahaha! Like there's somewhere else that’ll take a guy like me.

Saejima: If ya can't find anythin', come see me. Gonna be leavin' town for a while tonight, but I'll be back someday. If you're still flounderin' by then, I'll give ya a hand up.

Washed-up Yakuza: Oh, uh... Thanks.

Saejima: (Well, that took longer than I was hopin'. Better get to New Serena before it's too late.)

[He goes to the bar. As he walks up the hall, he sees Date behind the counter and New Mama. Date didn't even bother to take off his trademark trench coat.]

Saejima: Evenin'.

Date: Oh, Saejima. Come on in.

Mama: Please, make yourself at home.

Saejima: ‘Preciate it, Mama.

Date: So they're coming for you tonight, huh?

Saejima: Yep.

Date: Heh. Who would've thought you'd go from breaking out of one of the highest security prisons down in Okinawa to serving time all the way up in Abashiri? One end of Japan to the other.

Saejima: Like some kinda magic trick.

Date: Might not be so bad though. If you behave, you'll be out in what, two years?

Saejima: So I hear.

Date: In the meantime, we've got the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance still duking it out. As long as they're roughly equal in power, the yakuza world order is maintained. But if anything ever tips the scales one way or the other, a war will be the least of our worries. It’ll leave an opening that foreign mafias will come in and exploit. Not to mention all the two-bit street gangs who don't have to worry about anti-yakuza laws. That's why even us cops want to see the Tojo Clan back to its former heights. Ironic, huh?

Saejima: I dunno, makes pretty good sense to me. Rather have the devil ya know than the one ya don't. ‘Specially if that devil’s already on a leash.

Date: Too bad the Tojo Clan has far bigger problems than its lack of quality footsoldiers. The leadership's been more or less gutted. All that's left now is plain old businessmen who only know how to do one thing: make money. The numbers look good on the surface, sure. But those numbers are just papering over some serious cracks that’ll find their way to the surface eventually.

Date: Take that dustup with the Ueno Seiwa Clan. Low-tier would be a compliment for them, but they still managed to take the Tojo for a ride. Not only that, but some of the more remote subsidiaries are turning their backs on the clan. The Tojo's not much more than a husk of its former self these days.

Saejima: I know. That's why I'm goin' behind bars again.

Date: A baptism by fire. One that'll see you end up captain of the Tojo Clan when you get out.

Saejima: First n' foremost, I'm makin' amends. That has to come before anythin' else.

Date: Smart. There're plenty of oldhand Tojo guys who are pissed about how you walked back into the clan. But this’ll prove your worth. Keep your own clan members from stabbing you in the back. Bet you long for the days when the cops were the only ones you had to watch out for.

Saejima: Got that right.

Date: Looks like our old friend's gone for good this time, too. Meaning it's on you and Majima to shoulder the clan. Be Daigo’s pillars. Still, two years away is a long time. Whatever you do in there, don't get slapped with any extra time. You're pushing your luck with the Tojo as is.

Saejima: Yeah, goes without saying. Anyway, think I overstayed my welcome. I’ll let you lovebirds get some alone time.

Date: Hey, c'mon! You know we're glad to have you around.

Mama: Hehehe. Yes, it was no trouble at all. You're always welcome here.

Saejima: ‘Preciate it.

Date: Yeah... Come back safe, Saejima.

Saejima: Will do. See ya.

[He leaves New Serena.]

Saejima: (Well, that's done. Just gotta make sure I'm ready, then I'm off to the battin' center.)

[He goes to the Battle Center and sees Nishida near the entrance.]

Nishida: Saejima-san! It's good to see you.

Saejima: Majima here?

Nishida: Oh, yes. He's right inside, ready and waiting for you.

Saejima: (Majima's waitin' for me. But should I blow off some more steam before seein' him? Only got a few hours left of freedom, after all.)

Need more time. 
I'm done. ✓

Saejima: Better go say my final goodbye. Hey, Nishida? While I'm gone... look after Majima for me, will ya?

Nishida: Of course, sir! And you look after yourself, too!

Saejima: I will.

[He enters the Battle Center. It's empty. Majima plays baseball by himself. He waits for the machine to throw a ball and… misses.]

Saejima: What was that? Never seen ya swing that bad.

Majima: Maybe if I wasn't stuffed full of trash meat… Just messin'! These days, I'm strikin' out on balls I used to crush into outer space.

Saejima: What, the other eye goin' bad, too?

Majima: Ya sure you can hold up, bro?

Saejima: Dunno what ya mean.

Majima: We ain't exactly gettin' younger. Sure it's just three years, but hard time'll pulverize even the toughest of us. It ain't too late. I can yank a few chains for ya. Get that prison shit outta the sentence.

Saejima: Fuck that. I already spent decades in the slammer. What's a few more years?

Majima: That your final answer?

Saejima: Yeah.

[Majima raises his bat above his head. Two dozen yakuza enter the room.]

Saejima: What's all this? Ya not gonna fight me man-to-man?

Majima: Nah. My boys here'll handle ya. Stomach's eatin' me somethin' fierce. Still. I gotta know if you're up for the big house. Wanna see it with my own eye.

Saejima: Bro. Sure ya won't regret not fightin’?

Majima: Why would I?

Saejima: If we don't go at it now, we might not get another chance. Ya good with that?

Majima: Sure am.

Saejima: All right then. Don't got much time. Gonna have to settle this quick. You wanna see some strength? Then hold that eye open… and watch me!

[He fights the Majima Family with all the strength and might he have.]

Saejima: Well, bro? Think I got a shot at survivin' the slammer?

Majima: Known that from the very beginnin', bro. Nobody gets how strong ya are better than me.

Saejima: Then why're ya pullin' this bullshit stunt? Back in the day, you'd be first in line to fling a fist. What's happened to ya?

Majima: There's no use, bro. I just can't dance with ya how I used to. I'm the one who's goin' stale. After all these years keepin' the Tojo Clan high n' dry, guess my fangs went n' fell out. My time in the sun's over.

Saejima: You throwin' a pity party here? Ain't your style, bro.

Majima: I'm yakuza, yeah. 'Course I wanna keep playin' the tough guy. But nobody knows me better than I know myself. Gotta have the stones to face reality. So I had to make sure one of us still had it. Weight off my shoulders knowin' ya do.

Saejima: Majima.

Majima: Forget money. A yakuza ain't worth dust without strength. Ya let that slip, someone else is gonna come gunnin' for your spot. Saejima. You're the Tojo Clan's muscle. So get your ass back to Kamurocho, flexin' stronger than ever.

Saejima: I will.

Majima: Huh. Hard to tell who's really gettin' the send-off.

Saejima: Ya got that right.

[From afar, police serenas are heard.]

Majima: Your ride's here.

Saejima: Yup.

[He comes out of the building. The whole area is cordoned off by the police. The police are holding back the gawkers who are taking pictures of what's going on. Saejima silently gets into the police car and it drives away. Majima watches him go.]

December 2012
Abashiri Penitentiary

[Saejima and a few other prisoners rest in a room that looks like a back room.]

Chapter 1: ENDS OF THE EARTH
[Saejima steps out onto the fenced-off prisoners' recreation area. The port area is covered with a thin layer of snow and snowdrifts are piled in the corners.]

Saejima: (Guess they don't cancel rec time no matter how cold it is. Let’s see... Anyone I know around?)

[He walks up to one of his guys.]

Himura: Weird seeing you out here, boss. You usually spend rec time cooped up alone in our cell. Something wrong?

Saejima: Hey, I come out sometimes. N’ quit it with that boss crap. I already told ya I don't like it.

Himura: What's the big deal? I'm just being respectful! Only appropriate for Saejima-san, the great tiger of the Tojo Clan.

Saejima: Who told ya that?

Himura: No one in particular. It's just floating around the place. They say you're a legendary murderer who once took out eighteen guys in a single hit. I mean, you had to have known people'd catch wind of your life outside. Oh, right. Speaking of the outside, isn't it almost time?

Saejima: Time for what?

Himura: Your parole, boss! Duh. You’ve been here what, two years now?

Saejima: Somethin' like that.

Himura: And you got sentenced to three years for assault, right? That means you could be out of here in no time if they approve your parole.

Saejima: Too bad that's a damn big if.

Himura: You got that. The deputy warden here is a real cold customer.

Saejima: Yup. As harsh as they come.

Himura: We'll be just fine as long as we stay out of his way. Don't stand out; that's the quickest way to get out. By the way, Baba-chan was looking for you, boss.

Saejima: Baba?

Himura: Oh c'mon. Don't tell me you forgot who he is. The one shacking up in our cell!

Saejima: Oh, the kid.

Himura: Pretty sure Baba-chan's looking for advice or something. Not sure what on. I offered to lend him an ear, but he said it needed to be someone in his own line of work.

Saejima: His line of work? So he's yakuza, too…

Himura: Anyway, I dunno what's eating him, but you should probably go impart some of your sagely criminal wisdom.

Saejima: N' where's he at now?

Himura: Not sure. Oh, but Oshima-san would probably know. I mean, all he ever does during rec time is sit his ass down on that bench.

Saejima: Alright, I'll see if he knows anythin'.

[He finds Oshima. It is an aged man with an obvious loss of hair.]

Oshima: What can I do for you, Saejima-san? Do you need some more painkillers?

Saejima: Naw, just came for a bit o' exercise.

Oshima: If you say so. By the way, it's been months now since that gang started coming for you, but you haven't said a peep to anyone else in the cell.

Saejima: ‘Course I haven't. Can't go gettin' them involved.

Oshima: I wonder, though. Why are those thugs so pissed off at you? Is it for something you did on the outside?

Saejima: Doubt it. I was only out for a year. Can't do much to offend in that time.

Oshima: You say that, but they've been zeroed in on you ever since they got here. And that was almost six months ago now. You really think there's no reason for that?

Saejima: Maybe they got a bone to pick with the organization I was workin' for.

Oshima: Maybe. Either way, be careful. I thought they were your typical prison gang.. but this is something completely different. You might need a lot more than just painkillers if things go south next time. ...I’ve been wondering. Why don't you fight back?

Saejima: Can't. I got my reasons.

Oshima: Oh yeah?

Saejima: I gotta get out. Whatever happens, no matter what they do, I gotta keep persistin’.

Oshima: Freedom, huh. So that's why you don't retaliate. Still, you won't survive in here if you keep letting them beat you like that. Have you talked to the guards?

Saejima: Nah.

Oshima: Why not? I’m sure Deputy Warden Kosaka would listen. A strict man like him would never tolerate such flagrant rulebreaking. Worth a try, right?

Saejima: Dunno if I can trust him. Dunno if I can trust anyone.

Oshima: Because of Penitentiary No. 2? I've heard the rumors. It didn't sound pleasant, to say the least. But this is a legitimate prison. You should give reporting those maniacs some serious thought.

Saejima: I will.

Oshima: Oh, and the kid's been looking for you. The one from our cell?

Saejima: Yeah, Baba-chan. Himura mentioned the same thing.

Oshima: Poor kid. He's worried he won't get out.

Saejima: On parole?

Oshima: Mhm. I'm not sure why he's so eager, either. It's not like anyone's ever visited him here. I asked him why once, and he broke down in tears.

Saejima: Really? Baba cried?

Oshima: Well. That's when I learned he killed a man for his family, and then his family abandoned him. Who wouldn't weep?

Saejima: He's in for murder!?

Oshima: I know. I was shocked, too. He seems so timid. Must've been scared shitless when he did it. And then his family ditched him. I suppose that's normal in the yakuza world, but still.

Saejima: Murder... So he must've served a lot of time before he even got here.

Oshima: Oh yeah. He's been in prison for ten years. Did the kill when he was twenty. Now he's going to re-enter society after being gone a decade. And with no home, no family…

Saejima: (Poor kid.)

Oshima: He's gonna have to deal with all that soon. Just a few more days before his parole gets approved.

Saejima: Hm... I had no idea.

Oshima: Yeah. Look, you're from the same dark underbelly of society as he is, right? So talk to him, will ya? We're cellmates, after all.

Saejima: Sure. (Huh, so Baba-chan's a killer. He seemed like such a friendly kid. Who woulda thought? Where'd I see Baba-chan? On a bench up ahead, maybe.)

[He approaches Baba, who is sitting a few meters away.]

Baba: Saejima-aniki.

Saejima: Heard ya were lookin' for me. Himura n' Oshima clued me in. What's eatin' ya? Thought ya wanted to talk.

Baba: Not anymore. I turned it down.

Saejima: Turned what down?

Baba: My parole. I just talked to the warden. Told him I wasn't interested.

Saejima: Ya did what?

Baba: Guy like me? I've got nothing waiting on the outside. I should've mentioned sooner, but... I used to run with a Hokkaido yakuza.

Saejima: Oshima-chan told me. Ya killed a guy.

Baba: Yeah. I was twenty. We were at war with another family, and… Well, my aniki was moving up the ranks. Just a little push and he'd end up an officer.

Saejima: So. Ya offed this guy so your aniki could keep climbin' the ladder.

Baba: Right. He promised, he'd pull some strings once he got to the top. Whatever it took to get me out of here. It's been years since I last heard from him. At first, I thought he was too busy down in Kansai to come see me. But after almost a decade, the picture's gotten pretty dear. I was a tool. One who got tossed away.

Saejima: Baba-chan.

Baba: Sorry, I sure unloaded on you there.

Saejima: But it's fine. I'm over it now. I murdered a guy. Doesn't matter why I did it. This is what I deserve. Whether I serve ten years or a thousand, my slate'll never be clean. So the least I can do now is finish out the time I was given.

Saejima: You sure that's what ya want? Ya ask me, I think you're scared. Scared of the outside.

Baba: Saejima-aniki.

Saejima: I was the same way. Spend long enough breathin' prison air, the fresh breeze stops smellin' right. N’ sure. Your past'll cling tight no matter how long ya spend in here. But once ya get nice and burnt, ain't nowhere to go but out. See the light o' day. Tackle reality head-on. Never stop livin'. That's the first step towards atonement. The only way to find your own place in the sun. No matter how frigid the path gets.

[A trio of inmates approaches them…]

Shady Inmate: Heheh…

Baba: Those guys are in the woodworking crew.

Saejima: ……What do you want?

Shady Inmate: You know what we want. The crew chief wants to see you.

Baba: Who are these guys, Saejima-aniki?

Saejima: Stay out of this.

Shady Inmate: (smirks) You got some kid you're trying to hide? Oh, if it isn't your little cellmate! I get it. You're recruiting soldiers—nice, young ones you can turn into obedient little drones.

Saejima: Not another word about the kid. I’m the one you want.

Shady Inmate: Fine, then. Come on.

[He pushes Saejima into a warehouse.]

Shady Inmate: Here's your man, boss.

[The two other inmates hold Saejima’s arms. An ugly bald inmate with his left eye scratched out stands from his chair.]

Boss: Been one whole week, Saejima.

Saejima: Spare me the pep talk and get it over with.

Boss: Oh, don't be like that. You'll spoil my favorite part.

[He unbuttons Saejima's shirt - his body is covered with fresh scars and bruises.]

Boss: Looking pretty clean for a guy who could barely stand this time last week.

[He sticks his fingers into Saejima's fresh wound. He moans in pain, but restrains himself. The boss licks the blood off his fingers.]

Boss: He's all yours.

[Shady Inmate starts beating Saejima with a stick. The boss sits on a chair and childishly enjoys the violence. Some time later, Saejima is found by Baba, Oshima and Himura. He’s unconscious and lying on the floor.]

Baba: Saejima-aniki! Aniki! The hell happened to him?

Oshima: Must have been Kugihara and his crew.

Baba: Kugihara? You mean that bald-headed creep they tossed in here six months ago?

Oshima: Not sure why, but he's had his sights set on Saejima for just about three months now. Once, sometimes twice a week… They'll call him over during rec time. Thump the living daylights out of him.

Baba: How'd you know all this was going down, Oshima-san?

Oshima: One time, Saejima asked me for painkillers. So I had him fess up.

Baba: And you didn't think to tell us?

Oshima: He asked me not to. More than anything, he wanted to keep this a secret.

Baba: Dammit! We could've kept him from Kugihara no problem if he wasn't so closed off!

Oshima: Not a chance. We would've just given Kugihara's wolves more meat to feed on. Besides, Saejima doesn't want to fight back. Hasn't even raised a finger. If he felt like it, he could grind thugs like that into paste.

Baba: Then why won't he do it? There's gotta be a reason!

Oshima: It's… 

[A couple of guards enter the warehouse.]

Oshima: Kosaka! I mean, Deputy Warden, sir! This was just a little accident. Nothing you need to be involved in.

Kosaka: Take him away.

Baba: Aniki! 

Himura: Where are you taking him? You can't just go and—

[One of the guards punches him in the stomach. Saejima is taken away.]

Oshima: Himura! Deputy Warden, sir! Was this really necessary!?

[Kosaka walks away staying silent. Sometime later Saejima wakes u in a cell…]

Saejima: Ugh…

[He sits on the floor. A hatch opens in his door.]

Kosaka: Your meal. Something stopping you?

Saejima: Deputy Warden... Why're ya here?

Kosaka: Answer my question. What's stopping you?

Saejima: Nothin'. Just can't force nothin' down right now.

Kosaka: I don't mean the food. I mean Kugihara. I know his men have been assaulting you. Why have you kept silent about it?

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: Do you think that being a model prisoner will get you out on parole sooner?

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: Don't count on it. In my penitentiary, no one who brings disorder is a model prisoner, even if he brings it unwillingly. …That's especially true for those who plan to return to the underworld upon their release.

Saejima: (...How does he know that?)

Kosaka: However, I'm also a prison officer. I can't turn a blind eye to physical attacks on an inmate under my care. I can take steps to ensure you're kept away from Kugihara's gang.

Saejima: (Ya think you're some guardian angel, eh?)

Kosaka: If you request it, I can keep you in solitary for the duration of your term. All it would take is for me to inform the warden that you show no sign of remorse.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: Well? 

Saejima: Stay out of this.

Kosaka: What?

Saejima: If I stay in solitary, the gang might go after the other guys in my cell.

Kosaka: So, you think they're your friends just because you share a cell.

Saejima: Nah, nothin' like that. But I know if it ain't me, it'll be them gettin' beat. And they can't take it like I can. They'll end up leavin' prison feet-first. Me, I can take being Kugihara's toy.

Kosaka: So you think you're saving others by serving yourself up? You think you're some guardian angel?

Saejima: (...Me and this guy might be more alike than I wanna admit.)

Kosaka: I hate to break it to ya, but their only target is you. Kugihara likes to cause trouble, but he's not stupid enough to assault just any random inmate. So you're not accomplishing anything by putting up with such treatment.

Saejima: Are ya done?

Kosaka: (sighs) When you're finished eating, I'll let you out. That's the only thing you want from me, isn't it?

Saejima: (bows) ‘Preciate it.

[Meanwhile, in Saejima's "cell," which looks more like a recreation room or a cheap hotel room, his fellow inmates wait for his return. Oshima is reading a book. Baba sits on the floor and shakes her head nervously.]

Himura: Quit it with the fidgeting! You're gonna drive me mad.

Baba: Sorry.

Oshima: You're worried about Saejima, huh?

Himura: I get what you're going through. But we can't do much but sit on our asses. Besides, a trip to solitary's usually worth at least three days. We're just gonna have to wait it out.

Baba: I know that. Still... I can't help but worry.

Himura: That reminds me. You ever get to have that chat with Saejima-san?

Baba: Yeah... I did.

Himura: The heck was it for, anyway? You kept going on about him being the only one you could talk to. You don't trust us with your dirty laundry?

Baba: Well, it was…

Himura: C'mon. Spill it.

Oshima: He's scared of the outside. A yakuza fresh off a decade in prison... Can't imagine the storm waiting for him.

Himura: What, that's it? Nearly forgot, you're just about up for parole. I envy you, man. You gotta be pinching yourself at the thought of busting out of here.

Baba: Well... I'm not sure I'd go that far.

Oshima: I hear you turned it down. Parole, that is. Guards were talking about it.

Himura: (shocked) You serious? Say it ain't so.

Oshima: From what I gather, he told the deputy warden he feels no remorse for his crime.

Himura: Come out with shit like that, they'll lock you up and throw away the key. You all right in the head, man?

Oshima: Explain yourself, Baba.

[Saejima enters through a normal door. There are no bars or anything. Apparently his high position in the criminal world gave him privileges.]

Baba: Saejima-aniki.

Himura: (cheerfully) Welcome back! I didn't expect such a quick return from solitary.

Saejima: Yeah. Not sure why, but the deputy warden just let me out.

Himura: Wait, you can't possibly mean—Kosaka!?

Oshima: That doesn't sound right. He always comes down hard on inmates.

Saejima: Well, I don't know the man's mind. All I know is he don't like yakuza. Made it clear I wasn't gettin' parole.

Oshima: Now that sounds more like him. He probably knows you're a big shot, and he's trying to discourage you from using prison as just another place to expand your network.

Himura: Even though Saejima foolishly wants to be in solitary. Hahaha! It's a crazy world. Don't you think, Baba-chan?

Baba: *sighs*

Saejima: What's wrong? Hope you're not changing your mind.

Baba: ……

Oshima: You're still gonna apply for a new hearing tomorrow, right? Your parole cancellation probably isn't official yet. There's still time. If you go and demonstrate remorse, they might still let you out.

Baba: Mmm…

Himura: Hey, why we gotta put up with all the whimpering and shit!? Come on man, Saejima-san's back! Why get all down in the dumps just cause Baba-chan wants to mope around? Let's talk about something enjoyable. I know something!

Saejima: A map?

Oshima: This is a map of Sapporo's Tsukimino area.

Himura: It sure is. Everyone look at it and switch your minds over to the day when you can walk out of here and go anywhere in Tsukimino you want.

Oshima: Switch our minds over?

Himura: Yeah. It's called image training. You use your imagination, so that in your mind you're off having a good time in Tsukimino.

Oshima: What good is that? It's like a children's game. Actually, it's stupider.

Himura: Lighten up, Pops. Come on, it’ll be a welcome change from these dreary surroundings. Right, Saejima-san? You'll do it, huh? Come on, Baba! You need it the most!

Baba: Okay…

[He sits next to them.]

Himura: Good. Everyone ready? I want you to picture the streets of Tsukimino in your mind.

Saejima: Don't know Tsukimino that well, actually. Can't picture it.

Himura: Huh? Right, you're not from the north. Well then, how about we try this? Listen. I’ll tell you a story from when I was there. Saejima-san, you just imagine the situations I describe as if you were me. At the end you'll feel like it all really happened to you.

Saejima: Hm. All right…

Himura: Okay, here we go.

[And Saejima “teleports” to Tsukimino with the power of his imagination! Everything is purple white. Himura stands next to Saejima as a ghost.]

Saejima: So this is Tsukimino?

Himura: Yup. Gorgeous, right?

Saejima: Can't tell. I can only imagine a little of it from your map.

Himura: No problem! I'll tell you a story from when I was there—that'll fill in the gaps in your imagination!

Saejima: Uh, I don't get it, but okay.

Himura: Where to begin? I know! I’ll tell you about a time I visited a hostess club. The club was in the south part of town. On Lavender Street!

Saejima: All right. I just... imagine myself walking there, I guess. But I'm not wearin' the right duds for it…

[He changes to his long jacket and long hair from Yakuza 4 and the beginning of the game.]

Saejima: That's better. Been too long since I wore this.

Himura: Okay, off we go! Lavender Street awaits.

[They walk the streets of an imaginary town.]

Himura: Here's the club! Looks cool, huh?

Saejima: Looks expensive, is what I was gonna say. You could afford a joint like this?

Himura: Heheh. At one point in my life, I had ten million yen to play with. Ah, those were the days…

{10 million yen is about $75,000.}

Saejima: You're shittin' me. Ten mil?

Himura: Oh yeah. I might not look it, but I used to be a real high roller. Go ahead, pretend you've got oodles of yen burning a damn hole in your pocket. You need to party hard tonight!

Saejima: Hmm…

10 million yen appeared in your wallet.

Saejima: Hey, that wasn't hard to imagine.

Himura: There you go! Doesn't it feel spectacular to be loaded with cash? Like anything's possible? That's how I felt as I went into the club…

[He and Saejima walk into the building.]

Staff: (bows) Hello. Welcome to Rose Hip. Our establishment has an 8,400 yen minimum, along with a 3,150 yen cover charge. Requesting a specific hostess incurs another 3,150 yen fee.

{8,400 yen = $62; 3150 yen = $23}

Staff: Would you like to join us today?

Himura: Oh yeah! We are loaded today, buddy! Let us see your most popular girl!

Staff: Understood, sir.

Himura: That there was my fancy way of asking the club to bring us their girl, Kaguya-chan.

Kaguya: Hello there.

Himura: Well? Isn't she hot? Kaguya-chan here is 26 years old, a Scorpio, and her blood type is A. She has a younger sister, and she watches martial arts! So, I came here to enjoy a sweet evening with Kaguya- chan.

Kaguya: (to Saejima) What would you like to order?

[Saejima buys the most expensive item on the menu - a champagne fountain for 1 million yen ($7400)!]

Kaguya: Oh, wow! You're so generous, Saejima-san!

[Two waiters come up and professionally assemble the tower.]

Waiter: Okay, let's start our champagne tower!

Kaguya: Wow, so pretty!

Waiter: And that's it! Thank you! Let's hear some applause!

Kaguya: (clapping) Whoa… Amazing! Cheers! Thank you for coming! ♥ Where did you come from, Saejima-san?

Saejima: Tokyo.

Kaguya: Ah, what brings you to Tsukimino then? Work?

Nah. ✓
Yeah.

Saejima: Nah, this ain't for work. I came here 'cause I wanted to.

Kaguya: Oh, well that's nice! I wish I could go and take a vacation on a whim like that.

Saejima: It ain't exactly a vacation, either.

Kaguya: I went to Kamurocho for work before, you know.

Saejima: Oh? For a hostess gig?

Kaguya: Yes. Just to make some money!

Why'd ya come back? 
Impressive. ✓

Saejima: Impressive. Ya hopped on a plane to Kamurocho just to work in a cabaret club?

Kaguya: That's right, It was a lot busier than here, and the pay was better too.

Saejima: Make a lotta money, did ya?

Kaguya: I did, but I spent it all.

Saejima: How come?

Kaguya: I went shopping in Tokyo and hit up the clubs. Before I knew it, I spent all I earned.

Tch, careless.
So yer a big spender. ✓

Saejima: So yer a big spender. Ain't nothin' wrong with that.

Kaguya: You think so? I feel like it would have been better if I’d been able to save at least some of that money.

But ya had fun, right? ✓
No use cryin' over spilt milk.

Saejima: But ya had fun, right? Then there ain't no problem.

Kaguya: You think so too, Saejima-san? To tell the truth, I don't actually regret it much at all!

Saejima: Ya live by yer own rules, don't ya?

Himura: Saejima-san, if you make the girl do all the talking, she's going to think you're boring.

Saejima: What do I do then?

Himura: Sometimes you should be the one to bring up a topic to talk about. Or maybe you can try ordering something else. Maybe start by asking her on a date!

Saejima: Say what now? That's kind of a big thing to start with.

Himura: What are you talking about? No guts, no glory!

Saejima: Ah, well. Guess I'll give it a shot. (Should I talk about somethin' else?) Wanna go on a date after this?

Kaguya: After my shift, you mean? Sure, I've been wanting to spend more time with you too, Saejima-san.

Saejima: Oh, really?

Kaguya: You weren't born in Tokyo, were you, Saejima-san?

Saejima: Nah, I'm from Kansai.

{Tokyo is located in the Kanto region. The Kansai region is located to the west. There, for example, are Osaka and Kyoto.}

Kaguya: I knew it! You can tell if someone's from Kansai right away from the way they talk.

Saejima: Hmph. How ‘bout you?

Kaguya: I’m Hokkaido, born and raised.

{Hokkaido is the northernmost island of Japan.}

So yer a country girl, huh?
Where in Hokkaido? ✓

Saejima: Where in Hokkaido?

Kaguya: Here in Sapporo.

Saejima: Really? You don't got an accent though. Is that ‘cause ya spent time in Tokyo?

Kaguya: No, I've just never had an accent, even when I was a child. People from Hokkaido don't have accents.

Bull crap.
Huh. ✓

Saejima: Huh. Now that ya mention it, no one I've met here's had one.

Kaguya: It's because we hear how they speak in Tokyo on TV. Maybe our grandparents might have accents, but our mothers and fathers certainly don't.

Saejima: Hokkaido's a pretty big place. Maybe Sapporo's the exception.

Kaguya: Maybe.

Saejima: Ya don't know yer own dialect, then?

Kaguya: It's not that I don't know it. Like people say “way” instead of “very.” Not me, though.

That's borin'. 
I see. ✓

Saejima: I see. Maybe it's just a sign of the times.

Kaguya: Yeah. People from Aomori and other parts of Tohoku have a hella thick accent, though.

Hella?
I’ll bet. ✓

Saejima: I’ll bet. I can tell if someone's from Tohoku right away. Their accent's somethin' else.

{Northeast region, consists of the northeastern portion of Honshu, the largest island of Japan.}

Kaguya: But you have an accent yourself, Saejima-san. What's the big deal?

Saejima: Kansai's different. We used to be the heart of Japan. That means that the Kansai dialect is true Japanese.

Kaguya: What!? What kind of logic is that?

Himura: Now be sure and try lots of different things!

Saejima: I'm kinda hungry.

Kaguya: What would you like?

[Saejima orders the most expensive item - a fruit platter - for 5000 yen ($37).]

Saejima: I’ll have this.

Kaguya: All right! Here, let me feed it to you. ♥

Saejima: Say what now!?

[He eats.]

Kaguya: Do you believe in ghosts or spirits, Saejima-san?

I can see 'em.
You kiddin' me?
Yeah. ✓

Saejima: Yeah, I think they're real.

Kaguya: Y’know, I really can't handle stuff like that!

Saejima: Heh, yer cute when ya get like that.

Kaguya: I’ve just hated ghost stories ever since I was a kid. Anytime I’d hear one, I’d be so scared that I had to have the lights on the entire night. Yesterday there happened to be a show about ghosts when I turned the TV on and so, thanks to that, I’m all sleep-deprived today.

I wish there were ghosts.
Yer worryin' too much.
Why are ya so scared? ✓

Saejima: Why are ya so scared?

Kaguya: A ghost I saw in a horror film as a child was terrifying. I think it wound up becoming some kind of childhood trauma.

Saejima: Ha! A movie? Ya know it wasn't real, right? It was probably just some costume with a guy inside it.

Kaguya: It may have only been a movie, but wouldn't it be scary if it were real?

There are no real ones. 
Probably. ✓

Saejima: Probably. Like traditional Japanese ghosts don't have feet, right? I’d sure hate for one of those things to come after me in the night.

Kaguya: No, no, no, don't say that, please! You're going to make me imagine it!

Saejima: Yer the one who brought this up, y'know.

Staff: You're coming up on your time limit, sir. Would you care for an extension?

Stay Longer. ✓
Leave.

Staff: Very well, then. Enjoy the rest of your stay.

Himura: Now be sure and try lots of different things!

Saejima: (What should I talk about?)

The Snow Festival ✓
Hokkaido
Girls with Big Breasts
Nothing

Saejima: The snow festival sure is somethin', ain't it? I had no idea this many tourists came to see it.

Kaguya: It's quite impressive, yes! I'm impressed by the people who make those things, and those who come out to look at them in this freezing cold.

The cold gives it more meanin'.
I hear that. ✓

Saejima: I hear that. I carve wooden dolls myself, but carvin' ice like that looks like no easy task.

Kaguya: Really? I don't know much about that sort of thing. You're much more knowledgeable than me!

Saejima: Have ya ever made anything yerself?

Kaguya: Never. I mean, I've built snowmen when I was little, but… 

Saejima: Yeah, ya don't strike me as a kid who'd go outside to play.

Kaguya: That has nothing to do with it. Sure, people from Tokyo get excited when it snows because it doesn't happen often there. But for people from Hokkaido, it's not really a fun time for us when it snows. It's a huge pain to have to go shovel it all the time.

Ya gotta have a sense of fun.
I get ya. ✓

Saejima: I get ya. I hear sometimes the snow piles up as high as a two-story house. I suppose that ain't somethin' to be happy about.

Kaguya: Yes. It would be nicer to visit as a tourist.

Saejima: So whaddya do when it snows? Stay inside curled up on yer futon?

Kaguya: No, the heating in my house is turned up so high it's actually hot inside!

I oughta call ya sweetie-pie. ✓
Ya oughta save electricity. 
Really now?

Saejima: Guess I should start callin' ya sweetie-pie, since ya practically live in an oven.

Kaguya: That's a good one! If I had your sense of humor, winter would be much more bearable.

Saejima: Heh. Maybe.

Kaguya: The other day, my friends from college called me up and we had our first LBBQ in a while.

LBBQ?
Oh? ✓

Saejima: Oh? Had some lamb barbecue, eh?

Kaguya: We had a cookout with around twenty students and alumni, I haven't been back to my university after graduation, so it brought back memories!

A barbecue at your university?
I don't eat it much.
Lamb barbecue's tasty! ✓

Saejima: Lamb barbecue's tasty! There's no point comin' to Tsukimino if ya don't eat some.

Kaguya: You really think so? A lot of people can't handle it, so I'm glad you like it, Saejima-san! Do you ever barbecue, Saejima-san?

I prefer eatin' in restaurants.
Yeah, I like campin'. ✓

Saejima: Yeah, I like campin'. I go all the time.

Kaguya: I figured you were an outdoorsy sort! Are you any good at cooking?

I’m better at eatin. ✓
I’m good at startin' fires.

Saejima: I'm better at eatin'. I mostly just wait and let the meat sit over the fire.

Kaguya: Still, if you're a big eater, it's more fun for whoever's doing the cooking.

Saejima: Yeah, I just keep on stuffin' my face.

Kaguya: Your glass is empty. Would you like something?

[Saejima orders a Gold Champagne for 300,000 yen ($2,225).]

Saejima: I’ll have this.

Kaguya: Oh, are you sure? Gold champagne, please! 

[A waiter brings the bottle and opens it.]

Kaguya: Cheers! Thank you for coming! ♥

Himura: Now be sure and try lots of different things!

Saejima: (What should I talk about?)

Hokkaido ✓
Girls with Big Breasts
Nothing

Saejima: Hokkaido sure is big. There's so much to see outside of Tsukimino. I don't think I’ll be able to see it all.

Kaguya: I know. Even I haven't been to that many places.

Saejima: Really?

Kaguya: I mean, I go to Otaru once in a while. Oh, and I went to Hakodate once on a school field trip.

How about Abashiri? ✓
Ya oughta get out more.
That's all?

Kaguya: Abashiri? Where that prison is?

Saejima: Yeah. Ever been there?

Kaguya: I haven't, no. Is there anything there other than the prison?

Saejima: Lemme think... They've got Nipopo dolls.

Kaguya: Oh? What are those?

Saejima: Nipopo dolls. They're a local Abashiri craft.

Kaguya: Wow, really? I didn't know about those. You sure know a lot about Abashiri, Saejima-san!

Saejima: ……

Kaguya: Were you cold outside?

I'm fine. ✓
It was freezin’.

Saejima: I'm fine. It's colder up in the mountains. Here in Tsukimino, my normal clothes are enough.

Kaguya: Wow, you're quite the tough guy, Saejima-san. I can't handle the cold myself.

Saejima: No? Shouldn't ya be used to it if yer from around here?

Kaguya: I don't get outside much. I’m kind of a shut-in actually. Most of the time I hang around the house.

What are ya, a cat?
But yer out right now.
I get ya. ✓

Saejima: I get ya. I don't like goin' outside in the cold either.

Kaguya: Right? Come winter, I make it a point to hole up inside and never go out!

How do ya live like that? 
Ya'd get fat without exercise. 
I’m jealous. ✓

Saejima: I'm jealous. I used to hafta go outside, come rain or snow.

Kaguya: Hey, maybe you could hibernate like me! Then you can come out to work in the spring!

Ya'd get fat without exercise.
That'd be nice. ✓

Saejima: That'd be nice. We Japanese work too much as it is. We deserve to be able to take the winter off.

Kaguya: Right. And since you'd get sunburned in the summer, we can just work in spring and fall.

Saejima: That's maybe takin' a bit too much time off…

Himura: Now be sure and try lots of different things!

[Saejima orders Carbonara for 2000 yen ($15).]

Kaguya: This morning, the TV said that Scorpios would have the best of luck today!

Are they ever right?
Lucky you. ✓

Saejima: Lucky you. What'd they say?

Kaguya: They said today would be lucky for money! So I've got high hopes!

Can't help ya.
Want me to buy some drinks? ✓

Saejima: Want me to buy some drinks?

Kaguya: Do you really mean it?

Sure. ✓
Just kiddin.

Saejima: Sure. I like to work hard and play hard. Might as well have some fun today. 

Kaguya: I knew I could count on you, Saejima-san! You're so generous! Service, please!

[The girl is quite drunk…]

Saejima: So you believe in astrology, huh? Ya seem to be pretty happy-go-lucky, so I didn't expect it.

Kaguya: I don't really believe in it, exactly. I just think it's fun to watch it every day. Kind of like if it were baseball or soccer. It would be like, "Get out there and go for it, Scorpios!" or, "Might wanna rein it in a bit there, Geminis."

You should go all in then. ✓
What's the point?
That's fun.

Saejima: You should go all in then. What did it say about yer luck with romance?

Kaguya: Well... They did say I may have a chance encounter with a real dreamy guy! I wonder if they meant you, Saejima-san!

Saejima: Who knows?

Staff: You're coming up on your time limit, sir. Would you care for an extension?

Himura: Kaguya-chan's already agreed to go out with you, so shouldn't you be heading out about now?

Saejima: Oh yeah. No thanks. I gotta go.

Staff: Understood, sir. Your check, sir.

Receipt 
Cover Charge ¥16,800 ($125)
Hostess Selection ¥3,150 ($23)
Food/Drink ¥1,337,000 ($9,907)
Service Charge ¥3,150 ($23)
Total ¥1,360,100 ($10,078)

Staff: Thank you very much.

Kaguya: Saejima-san!

[She tells him something.]

Kaguya: See you later! ♥

Saejima: You bet.

Kaguya: Hehe! ♥

[Saejima goes out to the street.]

Kaguya: Saejma-san. Thank you for waiting. Where shall we go! 

Saejima: I dunno. Not familiar with the neighborhood. 

Himura: Come on, man! Karaoke! Where else would you go on a date? 

Saejima: Uh... How about karaoke 

Kaguya: Oh, I haven't done that in quite a while! I'd love to 

Saejima: Great.

Staff: Welcome. How many people are in your party? 

Saejima: Two.

Staff: All right. That'll be 1,000 yen for the two of you. Have a good time.

Kaguya: Hm, what should I sing? I've been listening to "Rouge of Lore" a lot lately. Maybe I should go with that. ♥ 

[She sings and Saejima claps his hands.]

Kaguya: That was so much fun. And I didn't expect you to be so into it, Saejima-san. ♥ Now I want to hear you sing, Saejima-san. ♥

Saejima: All right, I’ll do it. 

Kaguya: Haha, that's the spirit! ♥

[Saejima sings the iconic “Baka Mitai”.]

Kaguya: I could listen to you sing forever! And I love watching your Adam's apple, it's so sexy. ♥

Saejima: Uh... Okay?

Employee: Your time is almost up. Please bring the microphones and your check to the front before leaving.

[Saejima pays for the karaoke.]

Staff: Thank you very much.

[They leave the building.]

Himura: And so I had a wonderful karaoke date with darling Kaguya-chan. How'd you like it! Did you picture it in your mind?

Saejima: Been a while since I talked to a woman. But it was a good time, even imaginary... 

Himura: Glad to hear it! So, after all that fun I was just famished. I decided to go have a meal.

Suddenly, hunger melled up out of nowhere! 

Saejima: Food, huh? Nothin’ around here looks any good, though. 

Himura: Nonsense, there are loads of good places to eat in Tsukimino. My go-to joint is Matsuo Lab Barbecue for some mutton hot pot. But if you're not that hungry, you can get a small bite and drink at Gindaco Highball Tavern. And if you're still hungry for female company, there's Irakaya Hanako as well. Hm, where did on this particular night! Uh, let's just imagine eating wherever Saejima chooses. 

Saejma: Mutton BBQ, takoyaki, or a pub. An of 'em sound pretty good. Hm…

Himura: This is Irakaya Hanako, a place where you can get some female companionship besides Kaguya-chan. You'd like that, eh? Hehe, I get you Saejima-san! 

Saejima: Sure, prison definitely don't have what they're offerin’.

Himura: Right. It's killing me! Let's go in. 

Employee: Oh, hello! Right this way, please. May I take your order? What would you like to eat? Here is your check. Thank you very much. 

Himura: Well, how'd you like that, Saejima-san? Weird it should feel great! A beautiful woman and a tasty meal. Ah, with any luck, we'll be enjoying the real thing soon. 

Saejima: Yeah…

Himura: So there I was, happily stuffed full of food, when a problem arose. 

Saejima: Hm? 

Himura: Yeah. Just as I go to this intersection, a horde of punks swarmed the place. 

Saejima: Huh…?

Himura: You heard me, a bunch of punks! Imagine them, please. Imagine hard! 

Saejima: How d’ya expect me to...? Oh, okay. Imagination's more powerful than I thought. But why's this happening, exactly 

Himura: You mean why did it happen. It was over Kaguya-chan. The leader of this little ganges in love with her.

Saejima: So he brought his stooges to rough you up? Sounds cheesy. 

Gang Leader: Hey, you! Asshole! The only cheesy guy here is you, 'cause you're the rat who's been bothering my girl! 

Saejima: This happened? He’d hafta do this to every customer.

Himura: No, no, not every customer. Just me, because I hit it off so well with Kaguya-chan and had that karaoke date. 

Saejima: Ya sure ‘bout that? 

Himura: Of course I am! Anvey there I was, staring death in the face. And I grinned right back.

Gang Leader: What the hell are you smiling  at? Guys, let's stomp this little weasel! 

Himura: The boss was shouting! The punks were edging closer! But I calmly struck a fighting pose... 

Saejima: Brawin' at really what I wanted to do in my ‘magination. I get enough of this in real life. 

[He beats up the imaginary gang.]

Gang Leader: Ugh... He got us good... 

Himura: And so. I single-handedly sent these delinquents packing, thus proving my manliness and passionate love for Kaguya-chan.

Saejima: All right, I think that's enough. 

Himura: But there's more! All of a sudden I saw... 

Prison Guard: Lights out in five minutes! 

Himura: Ah man, it's bedtime? Guess we have to call it a night.

[And here they are already lying on their futons side by side like in kindergarten.]

Himura: What'd I tell you wasn't that a good way to lift your spirits!

Oshima: Hah. All your stories have the stench of fresh, steaming bullshit.

Himura: Hey, all of it’s true! Honest! And besides, if you're going to fantasize you might as well make it a story with some sparkle, am I right? After all, it'll be years before we can wine, dine, and be merry outside this place. 

Oshima: Hmph.

Saejima: (I agree, Oshima.)

Himura: They can't keep us from enjoying life. Not when we know we'll get out of here someday. That's why I'm okay with being here, paying any debt to society. We can put up with it as long as we keep dreaming about a tomorrow outside these walls. All the fun in the world is waiting for us out there. We need to make amends so that we deserve it. Don't you think that's a healthier way for us to think?

Saejima: (It’s somethin’.)

Oshima: You're right. Being here does not define us. We all had lives before, and we'll have them after. In the end, we’ll die on the outside, on our own terms.

Baba: ……

Oshima: We should all be thinking about what we want to do when we're out.

Saejima: …Yeah.

Himura: Zzz…

Baba: Um, Saejima-san, I…

[But Saejima is already sleeping.]

The next day… Afternoon Recreation Time

Saejima: (Treatment took longer than I thought. Baba-chan wasn't in the cell block. Is he out in the exercise yard?)

Himura: Oh, hey, Saejima-san. Aren't you supposed to be in the infirmary?

Oshima: Yeah, you're not scheduled for a shift today. Besides, you just got smacked around by those shady woodwerkers. Not a good time to be wandering around, you know?

Saejima: I'm fine. Got any idea where Baba-chan's gone?

Himura: Wait, did you come out here because you're worried they’ll go after him?

Oshima: You're thinking about Baba's parole bid, aren't you? Well, there's nothing to worry about on that front. After you went into the infirmary, Baba went to Deputy Warden. He's probably in his hearing right now.

Himura: Oh, wow. Really?

Oshima: It's all finally happening for Baba. He's been determined to get his parole and live a normal life.

Saejima: Yeah…

Himura: Well hey, that's great, then! He sure seemed to be rizing over it. Heck, I wasn’t so sure he'd get out, even if he is a good kid.

Oshima: He once said to me, “They call it ‘paying your debt to society’, but sitting in here and doing nothing doesn't pay back shit. That's why I have to get out of here and do things that truly atone for my sins.” He had morality, but he was scared of acting on it. You gave him the courage to act, Saejima.

Himura: Huh? There's Deputy Warden. Did he already finish with Baba-chan's hearing?

Oshima: Uh… I don’t see Baba…

Himura: Hang on, I'll go ask a guard.

[He walks out for a minute.]

Oshima: What’s the word?

Himura: Um... Apparently Baba's hearing ended over an hour ago.

Oshima: What?

Saejima: Where is he, then?

[He starts asking around.]

Angry Inmate: That fucking Deputy Warden Kosaka denied my parole request! What the hell did I do wrong!? That bastard screwed me over!

Confined Connoisseur: New Year's will finally be here soon. I'm looking forward to the traditional meal.

Saejima: I guess if yer in here, there's not much else to look forward to.

Confined Connoisseur: By the way, did you know that here in Hokkaido they eat the New Year's meal on New Year's Eve?

Saejima: What? They don't eat it on New Year's Day?

Confined Connoisseur: Nah. My cellmate's from Hokkaido, and that's what he said. I'm guessing that's not gonna be the case in prison, though.

Saejima: (New Year's meals in Hokkaido. Once I get outta here, that'd be a conversation topic.)

Saejima: Ya got a minute?

Bored Inmate: Huh?

Saejima: You know where Baba is? The kid in our cell?

Bored Inmate: Oh, him. Nope, dunno.

Saejima: Okay…

Bored Inmate: Heh, is there something wrong? I hope so. I’m bored out of my mind.

Saejima: Nothin' happened. Sorry to bug ya.

Bored Inmate: Oooh, hehe, something sure went down. I can't wait to find out…

Saejima: Pfft…

Sneaky Inmate: You made a name for yourself on the outside, but that don't mean shit in here. The deputy warden, Kosaka, hates yakuza with a passion. With all you ve been up to, youre public enemy number one in his eyes, Heheh.

Fearful Inmate: That new guy, Kugihara, is just straight-up crazy. I got up to my fair share of mischief to get put away in here, but I bet he did worse.

Shivering Inmate: Exercise time again. If I have to stay outside dressed like this much longer, I'm going to freeze to death!

Thoughtful Inmate: That guy Kugihara didn't waste any time finding himself a crew. He's got quite a following. I wonder if it's all his own doing, or something he planned from the beginning. Best to keep an eye on that one, I reckon.

Nihilistic Inmate: Even in here, some guys find a way to smoke. I guess that shows there's cracks in the system. All sorts of items and information slip through.

Saejima: Hey. Okay to talk?

Elderly Inmate: ……

Saejima: Old-timer, can ya hear me?

Elderly Inmate: Ah! Startled me, there.

Saejima: Sorry. Didn't mean to scare ya.

Elderly Inmate: It's fine, it's fine. I was just nodding off.

Saejima: Careful with that. Fella could freeze to death fallin' asleep here. 

Elderly Inmate: Haha, and what does that matter? I'm never getting out. Hardly makes a difference whether I die today or twenty years from now.

Saejima: (Cheerful guy, this one.)

Elderly Inmate: So! What did you want?

Saejima: Was lookin' for Baba, the kid I share a cell with. Seen ‘im?

Elderly Inmate: Baba…? 

Saejima: You don't know him?

Elderly Inmate: You get to my age, the memory goes. It's hard matching names to faces.

Saejima: Right. Sorry to disturb ya.

Elderly Inmate: It's fine.

Saejima: Hey, ya know Baba? From our cell?

Listless Inmate: Uh-huh… Saw him earlier.

Saejima: Really? Ya see where he went?

Listless Inmate: Mm... You know that creep Kugihara and his gang? Baba went off with them to the storeroom. That was hours ago, though.

Saejima: He went with those guys!?

[Himura and Oshima run up to him.]

Himura: Saejima-san!

Oshima: Bad news. Baba—

Saejima: Yeah. I just heard.

Oshima: Those bastards. It wasn't enough to go after you; they had to target the kid as well?

Saejima: We gotta get to the storeroom!

[They run to the warehouse. There you see Baba. He stands there with a bloody chisel in his hands.]

Kugihara’s Man: Bastard... What are you doing!? My leg! It fucking hurts!

Baba: No. I didn't...

[Saejima and some guards enter.]

Guard: Out of the way! What are you all doing back here!?

Kugihara’s Man: It was him! He stabbed Owada outta the blue!

Guard: He what!?

Saejima: Baba-chan.

Guard: Baba! Is he telling the truth?

Baba: No... I didn't do it. It wasn't me!

Guard: Yeah? Then what's that in your hand?

Wounded Guy: One minute, everything was fine... The next, that fucker jumped me!

Baba: (confused) No... It's not mine, I swear!

Guard: You! Bring the victim to the infirmary. 

Saejima: Baba. I don't believe it.

Baba: Aniki!

Guard: So much for your shot at parole. Only days left to go, too. You just had to go and ruin it.

Saejima: You can't do that.

Baba: Please! It wasn't me! Aniki! You've got to believe me!

Guard: Enough talk. You're coming with me.

Saejima: Baba-chan!

[The guard takes Baba away in handcuffs.]

Oshima: This is bad!

Himura: Baba-chan wouldn't do something like that!

Oshima: Of course not! He just submitted his request for parole. No one in his position would do anything that might extend his sentence.

Himura: So true…

Oshima: Saejima, what do you make of this?

Saejima: (Prison's a rough place, is what I make of it.)

Himura: There's too much that we don't know. Why don't we ask around to see if anyone can fill us in?

Saejima: All right…

Verify Baba’s Alibi
[He walks outside to talk to the inmates.]

Saejima: Say, listen.

Pale Inmate: What is it?

Saejima: Did ya see that commotion earlier?

Pale Inmate: No… I didn't see anything. No stabbing, no nothing. I got the hell out of there as soon as I heard the screams. I only looked back once, and… *gulp* saw them carrying away some guy. He was bleeding.

Saejima: Did ya see Baba-chan? The guy holdin' the chisel?

Pale Inmate: Uh, I mean we all did! You saw him, too! He just stood there, shaking.

Saejima: But ya didn't see the actual stabbin', right?

Pale Inmate: That's what I said! Didn't see nothing, I swear!

Sympathetic Inmate: Hey, the kid that shanked that quy earlier… isn't he your cellmate?

Saejima: Yeah.

Sympathetic Inmate: Hard to believe such a nice-looking fella would do that.

Saejima: Well, do ya actually know anythin' about him?

Sympathetic Inmate: Nope. Can't say I do. I've hardly talked to the guy.

Saejima: That's what I thought.

Sympathetic Inmate: I did see the guards hauling him off to solitary, though.

Saejima: Interestin’...

[He approaches anther inmate.]

Saejima: Can ya tell me somethin’?

Lanky Inmate: What about?

Saejima: Baba-chan.

Lanky Inmate: Oh, yeah. Thať's some crazy shit he pulled.

Saejima: You saw him stab the guy?

Lanky Inmate: Nah, didn't actually see it. But come on, it's obvious he did it.

Saejima: Why?

Lanky Inmate: I mean, he even had motivation. Wasn't Kugihara picking on him?

Saejima: Whaddya mean?

Lanky Inmate: Just yesterday I saw Kugihara's gang taking him to the storeroom. Didn't look consensual, if you know what I mean.

Saejima: That damn bastard…

Lanky Inmate: Hell yeah. Kugihara's a total psycho. I heard he pretty much drove one of his own cellmates to attempt suicide. That's fucked up shit. I bet Baba was getting attacked by Kugihara and his goons, and just struck back.

Saejima: Nah, Baba-chan ain't the kind of man who would do that, even if it was deserved.

Lanky Inmate: Hmm…

Saejima: And if no one saw the actual stabbin', maybe Baba-chan didn't do it.

Lanky Inmate: The victim said it was him, though, didn't he?

Saejima: Those creeps can't be trusted. We're gonna prove Baba's innocent.

Lanky Inmate: Hm.

Saejima: Well, see ya around.

Lanky Inmate: Uh, hey.

Saejima: Hm?

Lanky Inmate: Good luck. Proving his innocence.

Saejima: Thanks.

[Himura and Oshima run up to him.]

Himura: Saejima-san. How’d it go?

Saejima: Hm…

Himura: Oh. Not good?

Oshima: Basically, no one claimed they saw Baba do it, but nobody said he didn't, either.

Himura: Oh. Hm.

Saejima: But doesn't it mean the guards can't prove he's the perp?

Himura: Well, I wouldn't count on that.

Saejima: No?

Himura: The victim himself said Baba stabbed him. So that's direct evidence right there.

Oshima: Direct evidence?

Himura:Yes, that's directly observing a crime happening. See, it's different from circumstantial evidence, which is observing something that logically indicates a crime is happening, or did.

Oshima: Thanks for the mystery novel advice, but can we talk about what's important? Like whether the victim's account is enough to prove Baba's guilt?

Himura: By itself, it's not enough. But paired with the fact that Baba-chan was holding the bloody chisel…  See, that's a piece of circumstantial evidence, and a damn strong one. It perfectly backs up the direct evidence of the eyewitness testimony.

Oshima: Himura, where'd you learn all this?

Saejima: Baba said he didn't do it. Doncha believe ‘im?

Oshima: Yeah, we gotta believe Baba. The victim and his bunch are lying!

Himura: Naturally, that's a possibility. But, there's nothing to back up that assertion.

Saejima: (Damn…)

Oshima: So, that's it? There's nothing we can do?

Himura: Well, there is one way…

Oshima: What?

Himura: Rather than trying to prove Baba-chan didn't do it… We look for evidence that the woodworking crew is lying.

Saejima: How do we do that?

Himura: With the chisel. It had to be provided by either the victim himself or his pals. Because, I mean, it's a woodworking tool. Where would Baba-chan even get it? He's not in the woodworking crew.

Saejima: True…

Oshima: Baba could've taken the weapon from them.

Himura: Sure. But that theory is pretty shaky. Because at the scene, the victim claimed Baba-chan just stabbed him out of the blue. “Out of the blue” is not a phrase you would use if the weapon was taken from you or your friends. It's a phrase that implies the weapon was already in Baba-chan's possession.

Oshima: Ah…

Saejima: So, we still gotta find out where the chisel came from, then prove there was no way Baba coulda got his hands on it.

Himura: Yes! If we can prove that, it’ll refute the victim's statement. And of course, strengthen the argument that Baba-chan wasn't the perp.

Saejima: Hmm…

Oshima: Himura?

Himura: Yes?

Oshima: Why do you know so much about evidence and all?

Himura: Uh. Well, I’d appreciate it if you could keep this on the down low… But you see, I was, uh... I used to be a detective with the Hokkaido Prefectural Police. Homicide, even.

Oshima: (shocked) What!?

Saejima: What's a detective doin' behind bars?

Himura: Well, given the job, there's always… temptation. I just, you know… got swept up in just a little teeny bit of corruption, is all.

Oshima: And you didn't tell us.

Himura: Oshima, my job was finding and arresting criminals. What do you think these inmates would do to me if they knew I used to be their enemy?

Oshima: Yeah, good point. 

Himura: It was just bribery. Heh. To be honest, my term's so short I thought there was a good chance I’d get out of here without anyone ever finding out about my background. But now I’ve got a cellmate in deep trouble… a kid I break bread with every day. I can't just stand by and watch him go down.

Oshima: I get it. And... hey, I think I've got some respect for you, even if you are a cop.

Saejima: So, what's the plan?

Himura: The quickest way out of this mess is finding out where the chisel came from.

Saejima: Okay. So we ask around about that.

Himura: Right. Let's split up and do some legwork.

Oshima: Hah. Spoken like a true detective.

Himura: I’m getting pumped! Let's do this!

Saejima: Uh-huh.

[He asks around again.]

Saejima: Say, d’ya know Baba?

Scraggy Inmate: Yeah, I’m with him on the maintenance crew.

Saejima: Good. Say, you guys use chisels in your work?

Scraggy Inmate: Chisel? The wood-carving tool? Not really... They call us maintenance, but all we actually do is shovel snow. I mean, I can't say for sure that we never use them, but I've never needed to myself.

Saejima: Hm… okay. (Gotta find someone with better info.)

[He approaches another inmate.]

Saejima: Ya got a minute?

Familiar Inmate: What do you want?

Saejima: Who's in the know here? Who knows what's goin' on?

Familiar Inmate: Uh, that would be him.

Saejima: That old-timer?

Familiar Inmate: Yup. He's a pretty old hand here. He's got connections with the guards, I hear. He's pretty much Abashiri's power broker. Definitely has a lot of control over the flow of goods and information.

Saejima: Gotcha. Ya been a great help.

[He sits next to the old man.]

Saejima: Didn't figure you to be the info man.

Old-timer Inmate: Kind of a rude way to introduce yourself there. Just because we're in prison doesn't mean you shouldn't use your etiquette, Taiga Saejima-san.

Saejima: Guess I shouldn't be surprised you know my name.

Old-timer Inmate: Please. I'm the info man. Of course, a celebrity like you, everyone inside knows who you are. So. You want to know things that'll help you clear Shigeki Baba of assault. That's mighty big of you, trying to help the kid.

Saejima: I can see ya already know a lot about it. Well then, let's skip ahead to where ya tell me the source of the damn chisel.

Old-timer Inmate: Haha, you make it sound easy. But they're being tight-lipped and even tighter-assed about this one. It's bad, bad mojo, believe me.

Saejima: Are ya gonna tell me, or not?

Old-timer Inmate: You'll have to pony up a fair payment. So listen good. See the serious-looking inmate to your right? Don't turn your head! Just do a quick glance with your eyes, you nitwit. I need you to get some goods from him. Don't ask what they are, that's none of your concern. Just make sure no one sees you do it.

Saejima: All right, sure. Next?

Old-timer Inmate: Take the goods to the guard standing in front of and to the left of you. You'll need to be stealthy about that move as well. Don't just walk up to him. Pass it through the fence. Don't worry, it's small enough. I got lots of friends here, like those two. But I got even more enemies. So again, don't do anything to draw suspicion. 

Saejima: Yeah, I got it. It's a deal. (First, I get whatever-the-hell-it-is from that guy.)

[He does what the old-timer asks him.]

Saejima: (Okay, that's done. I can talk to the old-timer now.) It's finished.

Old-timer Inmate: So it is.

Saejima: Well? Any news?

Old-timer Inmate: Sure. You wish to know about inmates with access to chisels, yes? That would be the woodworking and leathercraft crews. Them, and only them.

Saejima: Leathercraft?

Old-timer Inmate: Yeah. They make goods like wallets and purses, then sell them to distributors.

Saejima: Okay, just those two crews. Ya sure?

Old-timer Inmate: Haha. Doubt me if you want. But I know a lot more…

Saejima: Yeah?

Old-timer Inmate: For instance, it's been a long time since any orders for leather came in. Weak economy, doncha know… In fact, the last two years, there's been no leathercrafting at all. You'll find neither hide nor hair of it… hehehe!

Saejima: …Wow.

Old-timer Inmate: Anyway, that means the only convicts with chisel access are the woodworkers. That's a fact. Another fact: every chisel is marked with a unique number. Inmates can only use the chisel that's assigned to them.

Saejima: Makes sense. Woulda been pretty dumb if the guards weren't keepin' track of such obvious shanks.

Old-timer Inmate: One last fact—you'll like this one. One of the woodworkers is... Kugihara.

Saejima: Huh! Now that's interestin’. Thanks, old-timer. (So the chisel's from the woodworking crew for sure, but we don't know who it belongs to. I should get back to Himura.)

[He goes to the warehouse.]

Oshima: So we know the chisel cane from the woodworking crew. Now we just need to figure out exactly who owns. 

Saejima: We could do that if we just got our hands on it.

Oshima: Yeah, but the guards took it when they hauled off Baba. 

Himura: All we need is a quick glance. Maybe a guard will let us see it... 

Saejima: Heh. Sure, well just out in a check-out request with the card shank library. Easy. 

Himura: Okay. Point taken. *sigh* In fact, if a guard catches wind of this at all, we're along to end up in solitary.

Saejima: So, any other bright ideas?

Oshima: Yeah. Let me do what I'm good at.

Himura: Which is what?

Oshima: Stealing shit.

Saejima: Hm?

Himura: You can't be serious. Do you know what's happen if you get caught? 

Oshima: Yup, I do.

Himura: This is prison, man! If you get nabbed stealing from a guard, solitary is the least of your problems! Hell, they could even extend your sentence…

Oshima: Don't worry. I won't get caught.

Himura: Wait… Are you...?

Oshima: Over 15,000 counts of theft, zero arrests. Behold, Businessman Heihachiro. 

Himura: Yeah, I've heard of you! When I made detective, you were already a legend. The talk was you'd retired, but I started doubt you ever really existed. 

Saejima: High praise for a thief. If you're as wood as ya say, with zero arrests, how'd ya end up in the slammer? 

Oshima: I turned myself in. For my sixtieth birthday. 

Himura: Why?

Oshima: All those years, my crimes were a secret I kept from my wife. Every day, I pretended to be a businessman, put on a suit and tie and went out on my heists. 

Himura: Yeah, that's why you were Businessman Heihachiro... 

Oshima: I promised myself that I'd leave the life behind on my sixtieth birthday. But on that day, I came home to find my wife gone. 

Himura: Whoa, what’d she do? Comit suicide after finding you out? 

Oshima: What? No! Geez, you're desperate for entertainment. No... She left me. For another man.

Himura: Haha…

Oshima: Shut up! Don't you see what I realized that day! All that time I was thieving. I hadn't noticed I was the one being robbed... of the most valuable thing in the world. I was disgusted with myself. So I turned myself in.

Saejima: …Everyone's got a story.

Himura: A big yakuza boss, a legendary thief, and a detective. Yup, there's really no telling who you’ll come across in life.

Oshima: I swore I’d never steal again, but I’ll do it for Baba. I can swipe that chisel from the guards, guaranteed.

Saejima: Fine. It's all on you.

Oshima: Got it.

Himura: All right, Oshima-san will deal with that issue…

Saejima: And us?

Himura: We should collect witness accounts. As many as we can. We've got some time, since Kugihara's gang is being interrogated by the guards right now. When we're done, we'll meet up here again.

Saejima: Okay.

[He and Himura walk out of the warehouse.]

Saejima: When you say witness accounts, what kinda info you lookin' for?

Himura: Well, we already know where the chisel came from the woodworking crew. But we need to find out who was using it. We combine that intel with the appearance of the chisel itself, and that should be enough evidence to prove Baba-chan's innocence.

Saejima: Got it. I know a guy. I ask him.

Himura: Ten-four. I’ll chase up other leads. Later, then!

{10-4 is a police code meaning "Message received", "OK"}

[Saejima returns to the old man.]

Old-timer Inmate: What can I do for you now?

Saejima: The chisels all got numbers, and they're assigned to certain woodworkers, who are the only guys allowed to take 'em out. Kugihara's a woodworker. Ain't all that correct?

Old-timer Inmate: Yeah. So?

Saejima: I want to know Kugihara's chisel number.

Old-timer Inmate: Hah, you think he's guilty, right off the bat. Ever occur to you that Baba might actually be the culprit, just as it looks?

Saejima: Never mind that. Can ya do it?

Old-timer Inmate: Of course. So, here's what you can do for me.

Saejima: Another delivery job?

Old-timer Inmate: Nope. See the guard there?

Old-timer Inmate: I need you to catch his attention and keep it a while. How about you... make him chase you?

Saejima: Be a decoy, ya mean?

Old-timer Inmate: Yeah. You catch on fast. Here, take this with you.

Saejima: ‘Kay…

[Saejima gets a Mystery Envelope and goes to the guard.]

Prison Guard: What?

Saejima: (Don't know what to do here.)

Prison Guard: I asked you a question! What do you want?

Saejma: ……

Prison Guard: You little—!

[Saejima runs.]

Prison Guard: Hey! Freeze!

[Saejima successfully runs from the guard for a minute.]

Saejima: (Whew… That should do it.)

Prison Guard: *huff* *wheeze* Wha— What have you got there!? Show it!

Saejima: You mean this?

[He hands over the Mystery Envelope.]

Prison Guard: What? An envelope? There's a note inside… “Nice jog”!? You bastard!

Saejima: (Sorry, guardman... Just indulgin' some old-timer's weird sense of humor.)

Prison Guard: Big demerits are coming down on you, let me tell ya! Whať's your name? Saejima, right?

Saejima: (Great, just great…)

Old-timer Inmate: Nice job. It's been a while since I laughed so hard! Fun doesn't come around here much.

Saejima: Did ya get what I asked for?

Old-timer Inmate: Uh-huh. Number 134. That's the number on Kugihara's chisel.

Saejima: Okay. Now, if we can just get the chisel itself…

Old-timer Inmate: And that'll prove Baba's innocence, huh?

Saejima: Yeah.

Old-timer Inmate: I see. Hey, here's a little bonus for you. Kind of like when a bank gives you a toaster for opening an account.

Saejima: Thanks. And by the way, banks don't really do that anymore.

Old-timer Inmate: Ah. Well, I guess I don't know the modern ways of thanking your customers…

[Saejima returns to Himura and Oshima.]

Oshima: Saejima.

Saejima: How'd it go?

Oshima: Hah. I've had farts tougher to sneak out.

Saejima: So… 

Oshima: Yup. It's been done.

Himura: Way to go, Heihachiro!

Oshima: Idiot! Keep your voice down.

Himura: Oh, uh, sorry…

Oshima: You sure you were a detective, Himura?

Himura: I’ll have you know, I was considered pretty sharp in the precinct. So the chisel. Whose was it?

Oshima: Just as we thought, it belongs to that Kugihara creep.

Himura: Number 134... Yep, it's his.

Oshima: We should take this to Kosaka right away.

Saejima: Wait.

Oshima: What is it?

Saejima: ……

[A few inmates approach them.]

Kugihara: Uh-oh, angry face! You maaad about something?

Saejima: It's me you want. You didn't need to drag Baba into this.

Kugihara: Of course I did. He's the one who stabbed my boy! Poor Owada, he'll be feeling that for the rest of his life.

Saejima: You're gonna regret this.

[He pulls out the chisel.]

Kugihara: Whoooa, tough guy, what are you saying? You going to pull a Baba and stab us? Hehehe…

Saejima: This is the chisel they say Baba used. It's yours, ain't it? Your tools have disappeared from the woodshop. Only yours.

Kugihara: Huh?

Saejima: I know ya threatened Baba and dragged him off. So quit playin' dumb and fess up!

Kugihara: Moron. Why would you even want to help that waste of space? It's not like they'll move up your parole.

Saejima: I don't give two shits about that. Right now you and I are goin' to the guards and settlin' this.

Himura: Baba-chan was up for parole. And then you had to screw it all up!

Kugihara: Well, if he'd only been a good little boy, he could've avoided all this. He should have been more obedient.

Saejima: What’re ya talkin' about?

Kugihara: Heh, last night I ordered him to kill you in your sleep, as soon as you were out of solitary.

Saejima: What!?

Kugihara: Hey, it's not like I asked him to do it for free! I'm a reasonable man... I promised your boy a job when he got out. Since his family ditched him, he's been scared shitless about being out there all alone. All I did was try to help him.

Saejima: You…

Kugihara: But your idiot boy said no. After I was so generous! So, I applied a little discipline. Bye-bye, parole!

Saejima: Hm!?

Kugihara: Here's how I made it go down…

Saejima: (Fuckin' bastard...)

Kugihara: First, I had my men fight themselves. Hehe, and the chisel stabbing—I must admit that was my favorite part. One of my better ideas. Then little Baba comes along. I pretend that I'm breaking up the scuffle, and I hand the chisel to Baba. He didn't even think twice—he just took it! Haha! And of course, you know the rest.

[Saejima clenches his fists.]

Saejima: Even in this trash hole, you're the most toxic type o' waste.

Kugihara: Yet we all end up in the same incinerator. Your little friend's a murderer. Get it? We're all trash in here. Me and you are no different!

[Saejima punches him hard. Kugihara falls to the bench coughing blood.]

Kugihara’s Man: Aniki!

Oshima: Saejima, what're you...

Saejima: On your feet.

Kugihara: So you finally took a swing.

Saejima: I said, get up! Ya want me that bad? Well now ya got me.

Kugihara: You ate hit after hit for months without so much as flinching. But we touch one hair on that punk's head and you lose your shit?

Saejima: Can it. It ain't you I'm angry at. I'm angry at myself.

Kugihara: Oh yeah?

Saejima: I could only ever think o’ me. Whatever it took to get out ASAP. It was all I wanted. That's why I let you do as ya pleased. Didn't raise a fist to the guy beatin' me down. What kinda yakuza does that? What kinda captain does that!? 

[He takes off his prison jacket revealing the tiger on his back.]

Saejima: Baba's like a brother to me. Not a chance I'm turnin' my back on him. All the pain ya put him through... It's time ya taste just what it feels like.

[He gets into a fighting stance.]

Kugihara: (smirks) Be glad to see you try. Haven't stretched my legs in a while. This is gonna be good!

[Saejima fights Hiroshi Kugihara and two of his goons. He wins easily. Kugihara laughs.]

Saejima: Somethin' funny?

Kugihara: I win. Finally. You put on quite the show there. No wriggling outta this one. After all this time, you finally did just what I wanted you to.

Saejima: What're ya flappin' about?

Kugihara: You wanna know the real reason we had you in our crosshairs?

Oshima: It wasn't revenge, wasn't it?

Kugihara: None of that petty shit! I'm here for one thing. Keeping the great Taiga Saejima rotting away in this dump! Would've shanked you ages ago if revenge was all I wanted. But I had to wait until you lost enough control to throw a punch. You were such a pure, model inmate, too. Too bad your shot at parole's sunk!

Oshima: Why would you...?

Saejima: So. That's why ya pulled Baba in, too. But we don't got history from the outside. Why trap me here? Whaddya got to gain from that!?

Kugihara: Not a damn thing myself. I'm just doing what the boss told me.

Saejima: What'd ya say? Who sent you!? 

[Kugihara just laughs. Kosaka approaches.]

Kosaka: You two again. Saejima.

Kugihara: Thank the stars you're here, Deputy Warden! This monster just started wailing on me!

Kosaka: Is that the truth?

Saejima: Yeah.

Kugihara: Kiss your sweet parole goodbye! We're gonna get nice and cozy this next year together, big man Saejima!

Kosaka: That's enough. Take them both! Treat any injuries in the infirmary.

Guard: Come on, no struggling!

Chapter 2: THE WAY OF RESOLVE
[Saejima is standing in Kasaka's office.]

Saejima: We not goin' to solitary?

Kosaka: Why didn't you stop?

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: That fight. Why didn't you stop?

Saejima: Funny thing. Short while ago, ya asked why I wasn't fightin'. Remember?

[Kosaka shows him a piece of paper.]

Saejima: What's that?

Kosaka: Your parole application. I spent the last few days writing it.

Saejima: Why? Ya said ya don't let yakuza out.

Kosaka: ……A week ago, the warden received this postcard here.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: It's a formal notice expelling you from the Tojo Clan. This penitentiary's purpose is to reform those who have committed crimes. Inmates who demonstrate sufficient reformation can expect reductions in their sentences. Parole is one such reduction.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: If an inmate is associated with yakuza, his most effective means of proving he is reformed is to renounce all associations with organized crime. And... it appears this applies to your case.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: I know you were going to be named captain when you got out.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: Two years ago, when you arrived here, the police included a note in your file. They recommended that your future promotion be kept secret from the other inmates.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: Three years… just for assault. There are only two reasons why someone would serve that kind of time for such a minor charge. One: you were set up by a hostile third party, specifically so you'd be forced to leave your organization. Or two: you chose to tidy up your affairs... for the sake of that very organization.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: All these beatings in prison, and you didn't defend yourself because you just wanted to return to the clan as soon as you could. Am I correct?

Saejima: I'm expelled. It's pointless now.

Kosaka: I'm going to overlook what happened today. The relevant factor is that you are no longer yakuza. There's no need for you to continue suffering here.

Saejima: I…

Kosaka: What? You're crying?

[Saejima picks up the note and throws it on Kosaka’s table.]

Saejima: Stupid.

Kosaka: I understand how you must feel. All of your time here reduced to nothing. But...

Saejima: That ain't the problem. I'm just ashamed o' myself.

Kosaka: Where are you going? Answer me!

Saejima: Kosaka-han. 'Bout my parole… I ain't interested.

Kosaka: What?

Saejima: Gettin' expelled helped me realize. It's never been about goin' yakuza again. I just wanna be with people I believe in. Don't give a damn what family I'm from. What title they were gonna give me. So long as I can atone and get outta here… That's all I need.

Kosaka: Saejima...

[Saejima leaves the office and returns to his cell.]

Baba: Saejima-aniki!

Himura: Saejima-san!

Saejima: If you're in here... then everythin' worked out with the frame job, huh?

Baba: Thank you. Thank you so much! I, um... What can I even say?

Saejima: Just seein' ya safe is enough. So, how's the parole lookin'?

Baba: I got the all clear. I think the deputy warden pushed it through.

Saejima: That's great news.

Oshima: I have to wonder, Saejima. How are you back so quick? Scuffles like that would usually net you at least half a week of solitary.

Saejima: Got swept under the rug. By Kosaka.

Himura: Kosaka!? First Baba-chan, now Saejima-san… Feels like we got ourselves a guardian angel.

Saejima: It's 'cause I got expelled.

Himura: Expelled?

Oshima: You can't be serious. They kicked you out of your own family?

Saejima: Sure did.

Baba: Aniki, you… What did you do to deserve that!?

Saejima: Couldn't say. But me gettin' expelled don't matter now. Dunno why, but...

Oshima: What is it?

Saejima: Somethin' don't feel right.

Guard: Delivery!

[The guard brings a fresh newspaper. Himura picks it up and reads the headline.]

Himura: What the?

Oshima: What's wrong, Himura?

北識新闻 (Hokusiki Shimbun)
札幌で銃撃事件発生! (Shooting in Sapporo!)
広域指定暴力団 (Broadly-designated criminal organization)
東城会最高幹部死亡 (Death of the top executive of the East Side Association)

真島吾朗氏死亡 (Goro Majima is dead)

組同士の抗争か?! (A gang war!?)

Himura: Take a look. Isn't this your old crew, Saejima-san?

Baba: Top officer with the Tojo Clan, Goro Majima-shi... Found dead!? Aniki, that guy...

Saejima: Guess my feelin' was legit.

Oshima: Right after you were expelled, too. Do you think this is related?

Baba: Aniki!

Saejima: Naw… I ain't believin' it!

[He throws the newspaper on the floor.]

Saejima: *heavy sigh*

Himura: Saejima-san...

Prison Guard: Hey! Quiet! Well… I guess it is leisure time... but don't be loud! Or I’ll hand out demerits.

Himura: Sorry, sir!

Prison Guard: Saejima. Baba.

Baba: Yes?

Prison Guard: Both of you come with me. We need to go over the work you did the other day.

Baba: Uh, yes sir.

Prison Guard: Come on, Saejima. Get up.

Saejima: ……

Baba: Aniki.

Saejima: ……

[They follow the guard.]

Saejima: Deputy Warden… So it's you who asked for us.

Kosaka: ……

Saejima: I enjoyed the fake reason for it, too. What's this really about?

Kosaka: Forgive me for meeting you out here. I wished to protect us from any potential eavesdroppers near my office.

Baba: What's going on? Kinda freaking out here.

Kosaka: Saejima's application for parole was denied.

Baba: Huh? No way, why?

Kosaka: I don’t know. These applications are evaluated by our Regional Parole Board. At least, that's the normal procedure. This time, however, the Ministry of Justice appears to be involved. The rejection came directly from them.

Baba: Whoa, that's weird. Isn't it...?

Kosaka: Saejima is a major yakuza figure. Naturally he's on the radar of many police organizations. Perhaps his status is the only reason the Ministry has taken an interest. That is what I hope. But I have my doubts.

Saejima: Well, is that all?

Kosaka: “Is that all”?

Saejima: I told ya already. I don't intend to apply for parole.

Kosaka: ……

Saejima: Also, Baba-chan ain't got nothin' to do with this. Me, there's only one thing I wanna know.

Kosaka: It's about Goro Majima, isn't it?

Baba: The guy in the newspaper? I was wondering why you were so shook up.

Kosaka: Majima is the patriarch of the Tojo Clan's Majima Family and lieutenant advisor to the overall clan. The Majima Family is several thousand strong. It's the largest faction within the clan. And its boss just so happens to be Saejima's sworn brother. Isn't that right?

Baba: He was a close friend of yours, Saejima-aniki? I'm sorry for your loss.

Kosaka: From what we understand, the person behind the murder is Taizo Kitakata, the patriarch of Sapporo's Kitakata Family.

Saejima: Kitakata?

Kosaka: Majima was attempting to arrange the acquisition of the Kitakata. He was conducting the deal in Sapporo, ordered there by Tojo's chairman. During his meeting with Patriarch Kitakata, he was shot and killed.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: Baba, surely now you know why you're here?

Baba: Yes.

Saejima: What's he talking about, Baba-chan?

Baba: The Kitakata Family… That's who I used to run with.

Saejima: You serious?

Kosaka: We should discuss this elsewhere. Wait for me in the storeroom. I won't be long. We need to avoid being seen together.

Saejima: Why are ya trustin' us not to pull anything?

Kosaka: I don't trust you... but I do trust you'll want to hear the rest of what I'm going to say.

Saejima: I see.

Baba: Um, Aniki…

Saejima: We can talk later. For now, let's just go hear the deputy warden out. Okay?

Baba: Okay.

[They go to the warehouse. Some time later Kosaka joins them.]

Kosaka: Sorry to keep you waiting.

Saejima: Baba-chan, what ya said earlier... is it true? Ya really belong to the Kitakata Family? The one that offed Majima?

Baba: Yes, it's true. But Kosaka-san, I swear I got nothing to do with any killings outside. I can't help what family I'm from.

Kosaka: I know that. What I'm concerned about is your safety.

Baba: Huh? What is this about?

Kosaka: It's a feeling I have. Everything about this whole chain of events feels planned out… carefully scripted…

Saejima: Whaddya mean?

Kosaka: Kugihara and his gang transfer here six months ago, and immediately start assaulting Saejima. Clearly, their objective was to extend your sentence.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: And then, you were expelled from your clan. I began processing your parole, and Kugihara tried another tactic. He set Baba up so that Saejima's request would be denied. Why is he trying so hard to extend your incarceration?

Baba: Could it be to prevent Saejima-aniki from getting revenge for Majima?

Kosaka: That's possible. Perhaps Kugihara knew about the hit before it happened. Perhaps he was sent here with the express purpose of ensuring Saejima's continued confinement.

Baba: I mean, the Kitakata Family certainly has influence. But I just don't see them being able to pull strings at the Ministry of Justice like that.

Kosaka: Well-reasoned. There are only two organizations powerful enough to influence the Ministry of Justice.

Kosaka: One is Kansai's Omi Alliance. And the other one is…

Saejima: The Tojo Clan. Kugihara's got ties to my... old family, Is that what you're sayin’?

Baba: What?

Kosaka: Yes. Given the scale of their behavior, that seems to be the most logical hypothesis.

Baba: No way! I don't believe it. Why would the Tojo do that to one of their own people?

Saejima: There's a traitor inside the clan. That's the explanation.

Baba: But why turn traitor?

Kosaka: When Saejima came here, he was slated to be Tojo's next captain.

Baba: Seriously!? Saejima-aniki?

Kosaka: This traitor might have wanted to neutralize Saejima and any power he holds within the clan.

Baba: So that's why they expelled him…

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: Right, but they couldn't just expel him without doing anything else, since doing so actually improves his chances of early parole. So they pressured the Ministry of Justice to reject Saejima's parole application. Thus, they keep the powerful Taiga Saejima trapped and languishing in Abashiri. That's how I read it. Take this.

Saejima: What is it?

Kosaka: In the back of the exercise yard, outside the southwest gate, there's a parked snowmobile. This is the key.

Saejima: I don't get it.

Kosaka: I'm letting you break out of here.

Saejima: Eh!?

Baba: Huh?

Kosaka: The warden is dead. Murder. We don't know who did it; an investigation is underway.

Baba: Geez… what happened?

Kosaka: He was traveling to Tokyo to inquire as to why Saejima's parole was denied. The assailants attacked him as he got out of his taxi at Sapporo Airport.

Saejima: ……

Kosaka: And that's not all. This afternoon, we will be receiving almost a hundred new inmates—transfers from other institutions. There's never been such an enormous influx before, and no explanation was given. I'm afraid they've been sent with a specific purpose in mind.

Saejima: ……

Baba: For real? You think those guys are coming to kill Saejima-aniki?

Kosaka: Matters have become much bigger than any of us could have imagined. If nothing is done, your blood will be on my hands, Saejima. Yours too, Baba, now that you are involved. I won't allow that to happen. I am sworn to defend the rights of all citizens.

Saejima: But if ya let us go, your superiors will have ya strung up by your ankles.

Kosaka: I'm prepared to face the consequences of my decision. With no regrets, I will be tendering my resignation. Integrity is more important than any job.

Saejima: Kosaka-han…

Kosaka: Saejima-san. Baba-san. You are officially no longer incarcerated at this facility. You have each sufficiently atoned for your offenses. Your freedom of movement is restored. I will impart just one request… Show the world who the real enemy is—those responsible for the warden's murder. Later tonight, after your cellmates are asleep, leave your cell. A guard will leave your cell door unlocked. Exit the building, cut across the grounds, and go out the southwest gate. The late hour should hide you from the eyes of Kugihara and any other adversaries.

Saejima: We'll do it.

Kosaka: One last thing. Please promise me this…

Saejima: What?

Kosaka: If, on the outside, you ever find the true culprit, don't kill him. Report him to authorities… Send him to prison alive. At that point, it will be our job to carry out justice.

Saejima: I promise.

Kosaka: Good luck.

[We’re back to the cell. The inmates are playing cards.]

Himura: So, what did he want? The deputy warden, I mean.

Baba: Oh, nothing too interesting. Just said he'd be putting in for our parole again. Right, Aniki?

Saejima: Yup.

Himura: Hot damn... The both of you, loose on the world? Gonna feel downright abandoned in here. So, Saejima-san. What's stop number one once you're out? You gonna head to Tsukimino, look for the guy who offed your bro?

Saejima: Not much else I got in mind.

Himura: Calling it now, then. It won't be too long till we get to see you again.

Saejima: Why's that?

Himura: I mean, duh. You're gonna go get revenge, right? A murder charge'll land you right back in our little cell.

Oshima: Quit it, Himura You're gonna curse the poor guy.

Baba: And besides! Saejima-aniki would never do something like that.

Himura: But that sap who got murdered, wasn't he one of Saejima-san's buddies? Hell'd freeze over before he took a slight like that sitting down. What, I make you mad?

Saejima: It's all good. Only natural to be thinkin' that. But I ain't goin' for revenge. This Kitakata fella might've murdered my bro… but he never did nothin' to me personally.

Himura: Then why track him down?

Saejima: Somethin' I wanna know. This guy who managed to take my bro down… I gotta see what he's like. 

Himura: And after your little chat? You gonna rat him out?

Saejima: Nah. I'll let him keep livin'.

Himura: Huh? You lost it, man?

Saejima: Just need one thing. My bro was the strongest man in the world. Only right I know his dyin' words. So long as Kitakata tells me, I'll be satisfied.

Himura: And you're gonna let him off the hook for the whole murder thing?

Saejima: If Majima got himself rubbed out, it's his own fault for growin' weak. No blamin' the killer. Either my bro went so soft any oľ chump could take him… Or the guy who did it was just too damn strong.

Himura: Can't tell if that's shallow or deep. It's a lot to swallow, either way.

Saejima: Hard to believe Majima's actually gone. So I gotta know for sure. Even if it hurts. My win.

Himura: No fair! You saved all your twos till the end!? That'd never fly if we were using Sapporo rules… Load of bull. Well, it's almost time to see Saejima-san and Baba-chan off. So before they go… How about one last hurrah?

Oshima: What, your imagination game again?

Saejima: Not much of a game. It's just an excuse for Himura-san to gloat.

Himura: Well, Saejima-san? Think you can swing it, one final time?

Saejima: Sure. Let's see how wild this one can get.

Himura: Be glad to oblige. Now then, let's see here…

[They jump into the world of imagination!]

Saejima: At least it ain't hard to imagine, this bein' the second time.

Himura: Yeah, looking real good.

Saejima: So what's your tall tale today?

Himura: Well, now that you know I’m a former detective, let me tell you about a big case that I broke wide open.

Saejima: Ya want me to pretend to be a cop while I'm behind bars? Odd notion, but I guess it's a change of scenery... Better change my look again, though.

[He again changes his appearance to how he looks before the prison.]

Saejima: It ain't the right garb for a cop, but…

Himura: It doesn't matter; just let me start the story! All right, it begins in this bar on Lavender Street. Let's go there—the place is called Ambitious.

[They go to the bar.]

Kaguya: Saejima-san, what a busy man you are. You're late!

Saejima: Hey, I thought we were workin' one of your cases?

Himura: Well, you see, on this particular night I had an after-hours date with my beloved Kaguya-chan. Together we walked to Ambitious, a local bar.

[They go inside.]

Kaguya: Ooh, they have darts! And a pool table! If you care to play, I think I’d prove quite the challenge for you… I’m pretty good at these games!

Saejima: Sure. Let's shoot some pool. But I’ll tell ya right now, I won't be takin' it easy on ya!

Kaguya: Hehe, and neither will I take it easy on you!

[They play pool for a while.]

Kaguya: I win! Saejima-san, I must say, you need to try harder…

Saejima: Yeah… you’re just too good.

Himura: And so, Saejima—I mean, I—enjoyed a pleasant rendezvous with the lovely Kaguya-chan.

Saejima: Don't pop up like that. Ya startled me.

Himura: But I have to reveal the true purpose behind my visit to this place!

Saejima: Eh? What's that?

Himura: Go ahead and sneak a quick peek at that counter, my friend.

[He looks and sees two mafioso looking guys.]

Saejima: Who're they?

Himura: The Chinese mafia. My prefecture was keeping tabs on them. An informant had just tipped us off about a weapons deal going down. Look at them, the audacity of these guys! This bar was under Kitakata protection, and yet here they are talking business in it! So you see, my date was just a cover. It allowed me to observe them up close.

Saejima: Why not just partner with a lady cop? Be easier.

Himura: It needed to look real—those guys aren't that dumb. Anyways, after a bit, they left. So I bravely went after them!

Kaguya: Is something wrong, Saejima-san?

Saejima: Huh? No, it's nuthin’. Just gettin' late, is all. Let's call it a night.

Kaguya: Of course!

[They leave the club.]

Kaguya: So long, Saejima-san. I hope to see you at the club again.

Saejima: Uh-huh, see ya.

Himura: After seeing Kaguya-chan off, I began my pursuit of the mob. Oh by the way, feel free to wander around. This is your imagination, after all! Karaokekan is close by. You remember that place from your last date, right?

Saejima: Oh yeah.

Himura: The mobsters were heading to Ramen Village on East Nakatsuki Street. If you want to chase them, go that way.

Saejima: Got it.

Himura: At some point while I was chasing the mafia, I entered an intersection. Suddenly...!

[Saejima dodges a car.]

Himura: You did exactly what I did! I too deftly sidestepped their insidious car-attack! And I knew my near-death experience wasn't a coincidence. They were aware of my tailing them. But still, refused to be intimidated, for I was an officer of the law. I resolved to protect the town and bring honor to my proud and noble profession!

Saejima: Weren't ya busted for corruption?

Himura: Ouch. That's a sore point, boss. Come on, let's keep after those mobsters!

Saejima: Hehehe...

[Saejima walks into a narrow alleyway as he is suddenly surrounded by mobsters.]

Himura: Yup, they were well-aware of being tailed.

Saejima: So, what'd ya do?

Himura: You really need to ask? I fought them! To protect the town.

Saejima: Hah! What a load! But fine, let's do this.

[He kicks their smug asses.]

Himura: And so, I once again saved the town from peril! Applause, please!

Saejima: Mighty heroic of ya. But come on, all this talk of bein' a former detective, it's all a pack a' lies, right?

Himura: I would never! How can you accuse me of such a thing?

Saejima: Heh. Whatever, man.

Himura: What was that?

Saejima: Nothin'. This was fun. Think that's enough, though.

Himura: Alrighty!

[They return from the world of imagination to their cell and go to sleep. At night, Saejima and Baba quietly rise from their futons and walk toward the cell exit. Taking hold of the door handle, Saejima turns around one last time and looks at the sleeping Himura and Oshima, with whom he has spent the last few years.]

Saejima: Thanks for everythin'.

Baba: We should get moving.

[They leave the cell. Himura wakes up.]

Himura: It's just like you said. Gonna be real lonely without those two.

Oshima: Yeah. Assuming, of course… That the inmates who transferred in today don't get in their way.

Himura: Eh. The fools can try if they want. But our boys'll be fine. Walls can't contain that kinda willpower.

[Meanwhile, Saejima and Baba are running through the long corridors of the prison. They run up to the door.]

Saejima: Yard's straight ahead.

[He opens the door. A frosty wind and a pile of fluffy snow hit him in the face. Saejima walks out into the yard. He notices a body lying on the ground.]

Saejima: The shit?

[Saejima and Baba move closer to the body and examine it. It is one of the guards.]

Baba: Aniki... What happened to him?

[Suddenly they are surrounded by fifty prisoners armed with pipes. They came out of nowhere. Kosaka, looking out the window of the watchtower, shouts to Saejima.]

Kosaka: Get out of there, Saejima! Run!

Saejima: Kosaka-han!

Kosaka: I'm sorry! I did all I could to stop them! You have to run! You have to escape!

[Someone stabs Kosaka.]

Saejima: Kosaka-han? Kosaka-han!

[It’s Kugihara!]

Kugihara: Going somewhere, Saejima?

Saejima: Kugihara! How could you!?

Kugihara: If I let you walk now, who would play with all the little friends I pulled together? They've just been dying to meet you!

[Saejima puts the dead guard on the snow and closes his eyes.]

Saejima: Baba-chan.

Baba: Yeah.

Saejima: Tell me somethin'. Ya think Kosaka-han would want us lettin' this trash live?

Baba: Of course he would. No doubt in my mind.

Saejima: With ya there. (to the inmates, loudly) Listen good! I ain't gonna kill ya! But y'know. Some shit in life hurts worse than death. N' you're about to find out what! Every day, 'til ya finally croak… You're gonna wish I'd ended ya here!

[He fiercely screams and attacks the inmates!]

Saejima: (The exit's right over there. Better make a run for it before someone comes after me.)

[After defeating all the inmates, Kugihara himself and a couple of his loyal subordinates descend on Saejima.]

Kugihara: Saejima! Looks like you're even tougher than I thought! But all that hard work's about to come to nothing. My new friends'll be showing up any minute now. You can try to break out, but you'll never escape us. Now get ready to die, Saejima!

[Saejima beats Kugihara and his girlfriends soundly.]

Kugihara: No... There's no way.

Baba: I don't get it. This many guys... and we still won?

[Saejima stands over Kugihara and with a powerful kick of his boot... swings it past his face. Kugihara squeals in horror. However, nothing is over yet. Saejima hits Kugihara's wrist with a powerful kick of his boot. He does it over and over again until his Kugihara's bleeds and the bone crunches.]

Saejima: Deal with that how ya want. Lop it off if ya gotta. Whatever it takes to keep livin'. This is what happens when ya go pickin' fights with a yakuza. Shoulda been ready for this since day one.

Kugihara: (in horror) Please, don't kill me...

Saejima: Wasn't plannin' on it. No breakin' my promise with Kosaka-han. Ya good to go, Baba-chan?

Baba: Yeah.

[They walk slowly toward the exit. Kugihara gets to his feet. He pulls out a gun!!!]

Kugihara: Don't think... you're getting off that easy! Now die, Saejima!

[The sound of a gunshot occurs. Saejima only manages to turn around... But the bullet hole is only in Kugihara's body! Not far from him stands Himura with a revolver in his hands.]

Himura: Who knew they gave our guards such antique hunks of scrap? Surprised I even landed the shot.

Baba: Himura-san!

Himura: Hey, I was a homicide detective, remember? My tales of glory aren't full of as much bullshit as you all seem to think!

Saejima: Uh…

Himura: By the way, Oshima-san is dealing with the deputy warden. It might be dicey, but at least you shouldn't get any trouble from him while you make your getaway.

Saejima: You serious!?

Himura: Dead serious. Haha, Oshima, that rascally old geezer... You know how he'd hoard meds and pass them to other inmates? Turns out that's a habit left over from his brief time as a doctor. Who the heck moves on from being a doctor, then ends up in prison? Boy, you never can know someone, eh?

Baba: Whatever past any of you have, I'm just relieved we're getting out!

Himura: That's right. You guys need to go. I’ll call the authorities and play dumb when they arrive. Don't get caught if you can help it!

Saejima: What about you and Oshima-san?

Himura: You know us—we're gonna be good boys and serve out our prison sentences.

Baba: You're not coming with us?

Himura: If we don't stay, there won't be anyone to tell the others of your incredibly daring escape. Besides, I hate the cold. Normally you couldn't pay me to go out in this. It's only worth it if I'm rescuing some friends.

Baba: Himura-san…

Himura: You guys need to take care, okay? It's dangerous out there. Real dangerous. They say a man-eating bear lumbers around these parts. It's supposed to be two meters tall!

Baba: Oh, for... Is this really the time for your tall tales?

Himura: Oh, but it's true! I swear it on... Ah, whatever. Get outta here, you two!

Saejima: I owe you a deep debt.

Himura: Sure. When I get out you can buy me dinner.

Saejima: I’ll treat ya to the tastiest tripe BBQ ya ever had. You'll be eatin' till ya burst.

Himura: Haha, why not short ribs? Why not, uh, anything but tripe?

Saejima: See ya.

[He and Baba run out to the garage and get on the snowmobile.]

Baba: We need to get through this storm as fast as possible!

Saejima: Hang on tight, Baba-chan!

[They ride through the snowy mountain pass. Some guys notice them.]

???: Damn! That idiot Kugihara didn't finish the job! C'mon, boys! We can't let them get away!

[They follow Saejima’s snowmobile trying to crush it!]

Baba: Think we got through the worst of it!

Saejima: Yeah! Baba! Ya alright?

Baba: I can't... hold on… Any longer...

[He falls off the snowmobile.]

Saejima: Baba!

[Distracted, Saejima fails to notice the rock in front of her and crashes into it, falling into the snow.]

Saejima: Baba! Baba! Can ya hear me!?

[As she explores her surroundings, Saejima notices claw marks in a tree and soon encounters a huge bear. It rears up and attacks Saejima with its powerful paw, but he dodges.]

Saejima: Huh. Guess Himura wasn't lyin' 'bout its size after all.

[Saejima has to engage in a battle with the huge bear. The bear appears to be quite aggressive and strikes hard, which Saejima dodges and counterattacks. After a dozen minutes of fierce fighting, Saejima proves to the bear his strength and it walks away. An exhausted Saejima falls to the snow.]

Saejima: Naw… I ain't dyin' here... I can't!

[However, he does lose consciousness. Some time later, a hunter finds him, he heaves him on his back, and carries him away.]

Chapter 3: FROZEN ROAR
[Saejima wakes up in some kind of hut. He is lying on a futon, covered with a thick green blanket. In a small, traditional Japanese fireplace in the center of the hut, a fire burns brightly and the burning branches crackle. An old man enters the hut, closing the door behind him, where a cold wind is blowing. Saejima tries to sit up, but it is very difficult for him. The old man hangs his double-barrelled gun on the wall and silently begins to take off his boots. Afterwards he sits down in front of the fire over which something delicious is simmering and pours it into a bowl. Placing chopsticks on the plate, he holds the bowl out to Saejima. Cautious at first, Saejima tries the food. Once he realizes there's no catch and it's just a stew, he begins to eat quickly and greedily. Some time after the meal...]

Saejima: So ya saved my ass, out there in the wilderness.

Old Man: You should sit still. You've got bad frostbite; moving around will damage the tissue surrounding the frozen parts. Just try to relax.

Saejima: Ya see another guy out there? I was travelin' with a friend.

[The old man shakes his head. Saejima stands on his feen not without some effort.]

Saejima: He could still be out there. I gotta go find ‘im!

Old Man: Didn't you hear what I said? Moving will kill you.

Saejima: (holding his stomach) I can't just sit here when my buddy could be in trouble.

Old Man: And I can't sit here and watch you leave! if you go up into the mountains untrained, you'll end up stranded. You think I need that on my conscience?

Saejima: ……

Old Man: I’ll go find this friend of yours.

[Saejima sits on the floor.]

Saejima: Ya willin' to do that? For a couple o' guys you don't know?

Old Man: Once a bear gets a taste for human flesh, there'll be trouble. The beast might come down to the village for more of its new favorite food.

Saejima: Really?

Old Man: The bear that attacked you—it was twice as big as normal. Am I right?

Saejima: Yeah, thereabouts. Ya sayin' it's some kinda man-eater?

Old Man: Don’t know…

Saejima: What?

Old Man: It's just rumors. Rumors from a long time ago.

Saejima: (Hm.)

Old Man: The point is, if I don't save your friend he could end up as bear food. And then that's just another problem for me.

Saejima: (...Hang in there, Baba-chan.)

Old Man: Take a stroll outside if you want. But if you insist on getting yourself killed, please do it where you won't be eaten by a bear. There's a change of clothes there. They're old rags of mine, but you're welcome to use them.

Saejima: I never thanked ya for savin' me. I'm Saejima, and I owe ya my life. Thank you.

Old Man: My name's Okudera. Goodbye.

[He leaves the hut.]

Saejima: (I can't just sit here... I can check the place out, at least.)

[Saejima changes into a black T-shirt and throws a warm jacket over it. He doesn't even close it and goes outside, where a rather strong cold wind is blowing.]

Saejima: (Who woulda thought there'd be a village this deep in the mountains… Damn, and it's mornin' already. How long was I out?)

[He walks a few steps away from the hut.]

Authoritative Villager: Hey, hold on there. You're the one who got hauled into the village this morning, right? I’ve got something to ask you.

Saejima: Who are you?

Nishina: I'm Nishina. 'm what you might call the leader of the hunters.

Saejima: So there's a huntin' community here.

Nishina: Yeah. It's a dying way of life, but we're still here for now. Traditional hunters have called this village home ever since it was founded.

Saejima: What was it ya wanted to ask me?

Nishina: We're worried... about another guy who's also a visitor to our town, much like yourself. We don't know what he's going to do next.

Saejima: What other visitor?

Nishina: Okudera. The man who brought you in.

Saejima: He's a newcomer?

Nishina: No, not a newcomer. He's lived in the village a long time, actually. But he's still considered a visitor, because he's not originally from here. In fact, I don't know where he came from. One of our hunters found him in the woods one day. He was lost, so the hunter brought him back to the village. Then he just... stayed. That was ten years ago. Ever since, he's only been trouble to us locals.

Saejima: (Looks like there ain't no love lost ‘tween the villagers and Okudera-han.) So, what's concernin' ya?

Nishina: I heard he went to the mountain this morning. Is it because the monster was sighted?

Saejima: Monster?

Nishina: Yama-oroshi. He's a giant, man-eating bear. Twice the size of a regular bear.

Saejima: Yeah? Huh. Sounds like the bear that attacked me.

Nishina: What!? You were attacked by Yama-oroshi?

Saejima: I mean, I ain't sure or nothin', but it fits yer description of the beast.

Nishina: Does Okudera know about this?

Saejima: Yeah, ‘course.

Nishina: Then... that's why... Agh, there's no time to explain! I have to tell the others.

Saejima: Somethin' the matter?

Nishina: Yes! If you don't plan on dying today, go inside and lock up tight! Whatever you do, don't go chasing after Okudera. You understand!?

[He walks away in a hurry.]

Saejima: (Musta been some trouble here... Somethin' to do with Okudera-han and that man-eatin' bear.)

[Ignoring the advice, Saejima continues to explore the village.]

Villager in His Prime: Hey, are you the guy staying with Okudera?

Saejima: Yeah, he found me on the mountain last night. I was real lost.

Villager in His Prime: Dang. That must've sucked.

Saejima: Tell me... does everyone here have somethin' against Okudera-han?

Villager in His Prime: Heck yeah. The village went through all kinds of shit because of him.

Saejima: What happened?

Villager in His Prime: Well, nothing that concerns you.

Saejima: ……

Villager in His Prime: Look, I’ll be honest with you—you probably shouldn't get too involved with Okudera.

Dainty Villager: You're that guy staying with Okudera-san, right?

Saejima: Yeah.

Dainty Villager: Why'd you come up to the mountains? You don't look like you came to hunt. Nobody in the village has seen you before, either.

Saejima: Uh, I usually hunt in a different area.

Dainty Villager: No kidding? Well, the road is snowed over, so you're stuck here for a while. We don't have TV, there's no radio reception, and we don't get newspapers. You'll probably be bored out of your skull, but just sit tight.

Saejima: Okay. Got it. (No TV or newspapers, huh? Lucky for me. The prison break's probably all over the news.)

Sakurai: You're Saejima-san, aren't you?

Saejima: How'd ya know my name?

Sakurai: Okudera-san told me to look out for a big man almost two meters tall, and if he tried to leave the village, I should stop him. Okudera-san doesn't want a repeat of the tragedy nine years ago.

Saejima: What tragedy?

Sakurai: Yama-oroshi attacked our village.

Saejima: Yama-oroshi. Ya mean that giant bear?

Sakurai: Yeah. At the time, Okudera lived with his hunting partner, a man named Sato. He was a good guy. But one day… Sato was pursuing Yama-oroshi, and ended up chasing him straight into the village. It was terrifying for all of us.

Saejima: Geez…

Sakurai: You see, that day, Sato heard that Yama-oroshi had been spotted, so he took it upon himself to go eliminate the menace. There was a blizzard that day, too.

Saejima: And? What happened?

Sakurai: Sato went missing. Okudera-san went after him, and was injured badly. And that's... when it happened.

Saejima: Yama-oroshi's attack on the village?

Sakurai: Yes. Thankfully, nobody died. That was a miracle in and of itself. But buildings were knocked flat, and every last morsel of food in storage was eaten. Getting through the winter is always tough. Losing our entire food supplies like that... it was devastating. You can't imagine. We were pushed to the very brink of starvation.

Saejima: That's terrible.

Sakurai: Ever since then, Okudera-san's been shunned by the rest of the village. And every winter, when it's snowing hard, he still takes to the mountain in search of Yama-oroshi. He shows no consideration for the other hunters. Maybe he's trying to get revenge for what Yama-oroshi did nine years ago. That's what the rest of us think, anyway.

Saejima: An' that's what he's doin' right now?

Sakurai: No, he said he had an errand today. Something about finding Yama-oroshï's food source.

Saejima: (He means Baba-chan. Tellin' Okudera-han about Yama-oroshi has stirred up trouble...)

Sakurai: Look, you don't need to know any of this, anyway. You shouldn't go up to the mountain—you'll just be another guy to worry about. Trust me, you should just go home.

I gotta go up there. 
Fine, I won't go up. ✓

Saejima: Fine, I won't go up.

Sakurai: Oh. Interesting. After everything Okudera-san told me, I was expecting you to be someone with a spine of steel, who wouldn't care what I had to say. But instead, you're wise. You're choosing the safer option.

Villager Past His Prime: All these damned blizzards have closed down the road. We're cut off from the rest of the world right now. So we can't go into town to buy food, and we can't hunt any more game 'cause the bears are killing them all. Don't know why the bears aren't hibernating as much this winter…

[Saejima walks around the snow-covered village calculating his options and returns to Sakurai.]

Sakurai: You're not really going up to the mountain, are you? Take my advice—go back home.

I gotta go up there. ✓
Fine, I won't go up. 

Saejima: I hafta go up there. I owe my life to Okudera—I can't just leave ‘im alone in a blizzard. Gotta ask ya not to stand in my way.

Sakurai: (smirks) Wow. Y’know… you're just like he said.

Saejima: Huh?

Sakurai: Yeah. Here's something else that Okudera-san said to me: “Saejima won't listen if you try to stop him. But, try anyway. And then help him so at least he won't come blundering in blindly.”

Saejima: Okudera-han said that?

Sakurai: Yeah. He knew you wouldn't give up, And neither of us wants you to rush into this not knowing up from down.

Saejima: Alright. So what do I do?

Sakurai: First, your clothing. Hm... Actually, what you're wearing right now should be good enough. After all, it's not like you'll be hunting or anything.

Saejima: Been good against the cold so far.

Sakurai: So that only leaves two things: food for emergencies, and a good map.

Saejima: How do I get those?

Sakurai: I’ll draw you a map. But food might be a problem. It's hard enough for the villagers to just feed themselves.

Saejima: I b’lieve that…

Sakurai: While I'm drawing the map, why don't you try scrounging up some food? If you explain your situation, someone might give you what little they have to spare.

Saejima: Okay. I’ll give it a try.

[He wanders around the village.]

Saejima: (Looks like there's another house up here...)

Nishina's Better Half: Are you the man who saw Yama-oroshi?

Saejima: Yup. May I ask yer name too, ma'am?

Kimiyo: (bows) Kimiyo Nishina. Nishina is my husband.

Saejima: Oh yeah, I met ‘im. The hunter fella who's the village chief. (If she's married to him, she prob’ly thinks bad of Okudera, too.)

Kimiyo: I hope you don't intend to go into the woods.

Saejima: Well, that ain't why I came callin', at least.

Kimiyo: Oh. Did you come looking for food, perhaps?

Saejima: …How'd ya know that?

Kimiyo: I remember that day nine years ago... when Okudera-san came to ask for food, just like you're doing now.

Saejima: What’re ya talkin' about?

Kimiyo: You may have heard... Nine years ago, Okudera-san went to the mountain in search of his hunter friend. He was determined to help, even though there was a horrible blizzard that day. And he knew that going out there without any food was suicide.

Saejima: So Okudera- han came 'round here lookin' for food?

Kimiyo: He came ‘round everywhere. He went from one house to the other head bowed, hat in hand. But… well, no one wanted to share their food with an outsider.

Saejima: Mhm.

Kimiyo: My husband wasn't any different. He didn't want to help. But me... I couldn't help feeling bad for Okudera-san.

Saejima: So ya gave ‘im food?

Kimiyo: Yes. I knew I would regret it if I did not.

[She walks into her house for a minute and goes back to Saejima.]

Saejima: Wait, yer givin me…?

[She gave him some Deer Meat.]

Kimiyo: (bows) Yes. It's not much, but please take it. It's good venison.

Saejima: But what if yer husband finds out?

Kimiyo: He won't. It'll be fine.

Saejima: My thanks for yer kindness.

Kimiyo: In return, can I ask you a favor?

Saejima: What is it?

Kimiyo: Can you... iust find out why Okudera-san keeps going after that bear?

Saejima: Why ya wanna know that?

Kimiyo: Ever since that incident nine years ago, there's been something wrong with this village. You see, everyone used to help each other get by. But now, there's no trust. Only suspicion. No one can forget the terror they experienced that day. And unfortunately, Okudera-san became the focus of everyone's fears.

Saejima: So that's what happened…

Kimiyo: Okudera-san rarely opens up to anyone, but for some reason, he seems to have accepted you. My hope is you might become his friend, and maybe even lift the dark cloud that's been hovering over him for nine long years. Please try. You would be freeing us from such a dreary state of existence.

Saejima: Alright. Ain't sure what I can do, but I'll try, ma'am. I’m indebted to ya, after all.

Kimiyo: (bows) Thank you. Please be careful.

[Saejima returns to Sakurai.]

Sakurai: Hey. Did you manage to find some food?

Saejima: Yeah. Someone was kind enough to share.

Sakurai: Good. Um, I have to confess, I actually had some I could've shared with you... But I wanted to see if you were determined enough to scrounge some up yourself.

Saejima: Heh, so you were testin' me?

Sakurai: Sorry about that. But at least now I know that you're the real deal.

Saejima: Glad I passed. Ya got the map ready?

Sakurai: Sure do. I only drew the basic geography of the place, but it's enough to keep you from getting lost. Stick to the mountain's trailhead today—that's plenty to start with.

Saejima: Ya think Okudera-han's around there?

Sakurai: Yeah, probably. I don't think he'd go further than that. Not without a good reason, anyway.

Saejima: Hm?

Sakurai: It's nothing. Like I said, the trailhead area should be enough for you today. The rest of the map's just in case you go back some other time. I recommend you add your own notes, like about landmarks and stuff. There's no better guide than the one you make yourself!

Saejima: Good point.

Sakurai: First things first. Look here on the map. That's the trailhead closest to the village. That's where you start ascending. And you should take that path when you're coming back as well. The winding blue line is Mato River. Just work your way up along it, and you won't get lost. Yeah, definitely stay near the river for now.

Saejima: Got it. ‘Preciate all you've done, Sakurai-han.

Sakurai: Well, I definitely can't do anything more! So are you planning to leave now? Or do you need time to get ready?

Go to the Mountain ✓
Need More Time

Saejima: I’m ready to go.

Sakurai: Okay. Be careful out there, Saejima. Whatever you do, stay near the river.

[And so Saejima steps out onto the mountain path. Everything around him is covered with thick snow. An icy wind is blowing. The blizzard reduces visibility.]

Saejima: Rgh! This cold is brutal. Even my bones feel frozen! Gotta hurry before I lose too much strength… Gotta stick to the river for now. Gotta meet up with Okudera-han.

[Soon he finds some tracks in the snow…]

Saejima: Bear tracks. Pretty close to the village…

[He follows the tracks.]

Saejima: Blood! Was there a bear attack? A blood trail. Better follow it. Already pretty high in altitude. Where are ya, Baba?

[Soon he finds a man lying on the ground and a hunter with a gun. He runs to them.]

Saejima: Baba-chan? Okudera-han!

Okudera: Why did you come here!?

Saejima: Baba needs help. I can't put all of that on you. ...You're hurt, too.

Okudera: Ngh!

Saejima: Did Yama-oroshi get ya?

Okudera: Got careless. I’m getting old. Forget me. Take care of him. He's badly hurt, but hanging on. Hurry, let's take him to the village!

Saejima: Right.

Beastly Roar: Gwwwoooaar!

[Okudera aims his rifle towards the roar.]

Saejima: Argh!

Okudera: It smells our blood. ...It's coming.

[He shoots.]

Beastly Roar: Gwwwoooaar!

Okudera: Agh! Missed! I’ll give chase! You take him back to the village!

Saejima: But you're hurt, too!

Okudera: It doesn't matter. Hurry! No time to waste!

Saejima: All right!

[Saejima puts Baba on his shoulder and walks away while Okudera covers him by shooting at the bear. Saejima brings Baba to Okudera's hut and waits for the old hunter, warming himself by the fire.]

Saejima: (I’ve been here a while, but Okudera-han still ain't back. The sun's set, too. I’m gettin' worried. Hope he's safe and sound.)

[He hears the sound of the door opening.]

Saejima: Okudera-han! You're all right!

Okudera: Yeah, more or less. 

[Baba sleeps peacefully under a thick blanket.]

Okudera: He was out there longer, so he's worse off than you. But if he takes it easy, he should be fine. Let him rest up a while.

Saejima: Gotcha. What happened with that bear? Did ya bring it down?

Okudera: Nope. The snow storm got worse. If I kept after it, I wouldn't have made it back.

Saejima: I see. The villagers seem to think ya got some special connection to that Yama-oroshi.

Okudera: ……

Saejima: Word is ya dedicated yer life to hunting it down, Why's that?

Okudera: Hunting is all about man's survival instincts. We hunt to live.

Saejima: ……

Okudera: For thousands of years, we've fed on the meat of animals we've killed. The meat in this stew is from an animal I hunted, too. We kill to eat, so it's our duty to finish every last bite. That's what hunting is about.

Saejima: ……

Okudera: But I don't want to hunt that bear.

Saejima: Whaddya want to do, then?

Okudera: I just want to slay the thing. I’m going after that bear to murder it.

Saejima: ……

Okudera: We humans are funny things. We kill people out of hatred so easily. Even if our lives aren't on the line. That's why it's a crime, and why you pay for it by going to prison.

Saejima: …Yeah.

Okudera: But only a few people come out of prison repenting for the fact they've killed another human being. Most insist they did what they did because they had no choice.

Saejima: ……

Okudera: Any killing not done to eat or protect yourself is purely on your head. No matter what excuse a murderer may give, they're just fooling themselves.

Saejima: Ya lecturin' me now?

Okudera: ……

Saejima: Or are ya talkin' about your own past? Which is it?

Okudera: ……

Saejima: ……

Okudera: Neither. I'm reflecting on my own personal reasons for going after that bear. Because essentially, my only reason for even being here is to murder it. Because essentially, my only reason for even being here is to murder it.

Saejima: Yeah.

The next morning…

[Baba wakes up. Saejima enters the hut.]

Saejima: Baba!

Baba: Aniki!

Saejima: You okay movin' around already?

Baba: Yes, I can manage.

Saejima: I see.

Baba: (bows politely) I'm sorry, Aniki. I'm just dead weight for you now.

Saejima: Never mind me. Ya gotta thank the guy that saved ya, first.

Baba: Huh? Who is that?

Saejima: His name's Okudera-han. He's an old hunter. This is a hunting village up in the mountains.

Baba: No kidding?

Saejima: You ain't outta the woods yet. Quit talkin' and rest up some more.

Baba: Okay… I'm sorry about all this. (bows)

Saejima: Just hold tight. I'm gonna go out an' tell Okudera-han ya woke up. (Better go find Okudera-han.)

[He leaves the hut and wanders around the village.]

Saejima: What're ya doin' with that shovel?

Kimiyo: Huh? Oh, I was going to dig up some meat I buried here last fall.

Saejima: Ya buried some meat?

Kimiyo: Yes, the ground acts as a natural freezer, so the meat can stay there all winter without spoiling. We store food this way for emergencies.

Saejima: Alright. Uh, so if yer diggin' it up… does that mean there's an emergency?

Kimiyo: Suppose you could call it that.

Saejima: (So she shared food with me when they were already running low...) Is yer husband out huntin’? Saw some deer on the mountain yesterday.

Kimiyo: No, because Okudera-san left on a hunt this morning. While he's out there, none of the others will go.

Saejima: Why's that?

Kimiyo: They say that Yama-oroshi is more likely to attack when Okudera-san's scent is in the air. Just like that day nine years ago.

Saejima: So, yer husband stays at home, afraid to hunt, and then makes ya come out here an' dig up meat?

Kimiyo: Huh? Oh, no, no… It's not like that. I just thought today was a good day to do this.

Saejima: Hm.

Kimiyo: Oh! Here it is! This meat from last fall has more fat on it than the meat hunted at other times of the year.

Saejima: Interestin'.

Kimiyo: Here... for you.

Saejima: Eh? Why for me?

Kimiyo: You're going after Okudera-san again, aren't you?

Saejima: Sure, might be, but…

Kimiyo: Well, better safe than sorry.

Saejima: But... ain't ya in need of this food?

Kimiyo: Yes. But I can't turn my back on someone determined to go to the mountain in this blizzard. If it makes you feel any better about it, come back and share food with me if you happen to gather any while you're on the mountain.

Saejima: I will. That's a promise.

Kimiyo: In the past, we all used to help each other out like this. That's the kind of village I remember, at least. Please, be careful out there.

[Saejima got another piece of Deer Meat. He approaches Sakurai.]

Saejima: Think I'm gonna go into the wild.

Sakurai: You're going after Okudera-san, aren't you?

Saejima: Yeah… but also ľ'm gonna start huntin' on my own.

Sakurai: Wow. Really?

Saejima: Nishina's wife was kind enough to share some food. I'm gonna repay her by catchin' some wild game.

Sakurai: Good luck…

Saejima: Hey, if ya wanna be helpful, ya got a gun I can borrow?

Sakurai: Hah. Before that, there's your clothes to deal with. You can't hunt wearing that—every animal's gonna see you from a mile away!

Saejima: Well, what should I do?

Sakurai: Hmm… I might have something in storage if you don't mind it being old. You won't look stylish, that's for sure.

Saejima: That don't matter. Be great if I could borrow it.

Sakurai: Sure. That just leaves the gun…

Saejima: Ya got anythin’?

Sakurai: As much as I’d like to help you, I only have one rifle. And I'm a hunter… We never allow ourselves to be without a gun.

Saejima: ‘Kay.

Sakurai: I seem to remember Nishina-san having an extra one, though.

Saejima: That so?

Sakurai: But who knows if he'd let you borrow it? His wife would be okay with it, but as for him... Well, he's not on great terms with Okudera-san right now.

Saejima: Only one way to find out.

Sakurai: True. Go ask him, and in the meantime I'll look for the clothes.

Saejima: Got it.

[He wanders around the village.]

Villager Past His Prime: Ah, you must be the man staying with Okudera-san.

Saejima: Yeah. Prob’ly be stayin' here a while.

Villager Past His Prime: So you're gonna do just what Okudera did ten years ago. He was lost in these here woods, and one of us found him and brought him back to the village.

Saejima: That so?

Villager Past His Prime: Yup, just like you. The fellow who found him went by the name of Sato. In fact, it's Sato's house that Okudera now lives in! Tch, he's basically a squatter.

Villager in His Prime: Hey, did you hear? Okudera's hurt. Yama-oroshi finally got him, eh?

Saejima: Yeah. Probably.

Villager in His Prime: You gotta be kidding me. That man-eating bear's back? Somebody's got to make Okudera stop provoking it!

[Saejima goes to Nishina’s hut and sees him arguing with his wife.]

Nishina: More trouble... Damn that Okudera!

Kimiyo: Honey…

Saejima: Sorry to intrude. But I got a favor to ask.

Nishina: You're still here? Didn't I tell you to get lost?

Kimiyo: Honey, really…

Nishina: What do you want? If it's food, we're already short. Find your own.

Saejima: I know ya are. That's why I want to borrow a gun.

Nishina: Huh?

Saejima: I know I'm an outsider. But I feel indebted to Okudera-han for savin’ me, and also to you and yer wife. I owe somethin’ to the whole village, really.

Nishina: So?

Saejima: I also know I'm an amateur, but I just can't take bein' a burden on ya any longer.

Nishina: ……

Saejima: Please. Lemme hunt! At the same time, I can protect Okudera-han from Yama-oroshi.

Nishina: ……

Saejima: Please.

Nishina: Forget it.

Kimiyo: Darling…

Nishina: The mountain's a far harsher place than you realize, Saejima. Even veteran hunters lose their way in a storm like this.

Saejima: I'm not going to—

Nishina: See, you don't get it! Or your ego is just huge... If our best trackers have gotten lost chasing quarry into the wild, what makes you think you can do it?

Saejima: I do know the dangers, Nishina. It's just…

Nishina: You might know them, but you don't understand them! How could you? You weren't here nine years ago.

Saejima: ……

Nishina: Forget about borrowing a gun. Go home and wait for your buddy Okudera to come back from his wild goose chase. (walks away)

Kimiyo: I’m so sorry.

Saejima: Don't be. It's my fault for not thinkin' this out.

Kimiyo: He's just afraid that what happened nine years ago will happen again.

Saejima: Yeah, when Yama-oroshi attacked the village.

Kimiyo: It's not just that. What scares us most is the possibility of death.

Saejima: But Sakurai-han said no one died nine years ago.

Kimiyo: Well, that's…

Nishina: What are you prattling on about!?

Kimiyo: For goodness' sake…

Nishina: We don't tell outsiders anything! Saejima, if you have no business here, then scram! Our lives are hard enough without you bothering us!

[Saejima returns to Sakurai.]

Sakurai: How did it go? Did he lend you a gun?

Saejima: Nah. Got turned down.

Sakurai: Thought so. Honestly, you should just give up. But since I know you won't…

[He gives Saejima the necessary equipment - a warm jacket, a hat with earflaps, and a rifle! Saejima changes his clothes.]

Saejima: Where'd you get this gun?

Sakurai: Nishina-san dropped it off, actually. He doesn't want to lend you a rifle, but he wants you going up there unarmed even less.

Saejima: What's his deal, anyway?

Sakurai: It's not your concern right now. So, are you gonna do what you said you'd do, and go to the mountain?

Yup, I'm headin' out. ✓
Ain't ready yet.

Saejima: Yup, I'm headin' out.

Sakurai: Okay, you take care out there.

[Saejima goes out into the mountains and soon finds Okudera. He just stands on the path and gazes into the distance.]

Okudera: Saejima! What are you doing here?

Saejima: Came to tell ya that Baba-chan woke up. Also… I can't stand bein' a burden on ya anymore. I wanna try huntin' my own food, at least. And I gotta repay the person who shared her food with me, even when she don't have much for herself.

Okudera: That getup. That gun. Where'd you get them? Please don't tell me you stole them.

Saejima: No, it's all legit. I pled my case to some kindly folks, and they let me borrow this stuff. Lotta kind people in the village, actually... Why don't ya try befriendin' them some time?

Okudera: Hmph. It's none of your business.

Saejima: Okay, that's fine, Okudera-han. But I still wanna hunt. Can ya teach me the basics?

Okudera: Fine, I’ll do it. My life will be easier when you're not just another mouth to feed, anyway.

Saejima: Great.

Okudera: Okay, the basics. Okay, listen close if you're serious about learning to hunt and trap. Today, I’ll teach you how to use your rifle.

Saejima: To shoot game?

Okudera: Yes. Now usually, aftera shooting session, a gun needs to be properly cleaned and serviced. But that's an involved process... one I don't feel like teaching you, frankly. So I’ll just clean it myself whenever you come back from the mountain. That way, you only have to carry it when you're hunting. Less tedium for both of us.

Saejima: Sure. Less tedium, and less work for me.

Okudera: Exactly. Now, obviously, you can't shoot accurately if you're too far away. If you spot game, you have to approach it without letting it see you. The key is to make yourself small and quiet. You just crouch down and creep forward. Try it.

[Saejima tries to crouch and approaches Okudera.]

Okudera: Good. Crouching makes you less noticeable so that you can get as close to the animal as possible. Of course sometimes, it's better to just stay still, get low, and wait for a good shot. All right. Why don't you load your weapon? It's the same procedure as when you reload it after shooting a round.

[Saejima reloads the gun.]

Okudera: That gun can only hold two rounds at a time. So don't waste shots, or your prey will happily escape while you're reloading. Some animals will even retaliate. They'll come right up and attack you, so try not to miss! Aim very carefully before you pull the trigger. Let's see how you shoot. Aim for that boulder over there.

[Saejima shoots at the boulder on the opposite bank of the river.]

Okudera: Not bad, Saejima. You're a natural. So, the principal idea is to creep as close as you can to the prey, aim for its head, and drop it with a single shot. Be wary of bears. If you shoot at one and miss, it will definitely come after you. And don't think you can beat one in a fistfight. Now you know the basics of riflery. The rest you’ll learn through practice. Let's try hunting deer today.

Saejima: Fine with me.

Okudera: All right, but let's not just wander around aimlessly. There's a hunting hut on the mountain—let's head there.

Saejima: A huntin' hut?

Okudera: Here's where we are right now, on the map. There's actually more than one hunting hut, but the closest one is here. It's a base camp for hunters. Perfect for our purposes right now. I can't shoot well with my injury, so you should walk ahead of me, in case anything surprises us.

[They walk through the woods toward the hut, but find it destroyed.]

Okudera: This used to be a hunting hut. I haven't been to this one in a while—I typically use the other ones… But what a shame to see it like this. Bears must have knocked it flat.

Saejima: This is Yama-oroshi's doin’?

Okudera: Who knows? Other bears may not be as strong or big as he is, but they could still do something like this. Such a shame... But at least it can be fixed with a hut repair kit from the village. If you fix it, it could be used as a hunting hut again.

Saejima: Sure, but it ain't like I got the money for buyin' any hut repair kit. That'll have to wait.

Okudera: That's the way of a hunter's life... He's poor until he catches his prey. Why don't we try to rectify that now? Let's look for some deer.

Saejima: Ya don't have to convince me.

[They walk through the snow-covered forest until they find some tracks.]

Saejima: Okudera-han, whaddya make of these tracks?

Okudera: Definitely deer tracks, and they're fresh. The deer are probably close by.

Saejima: So, follow 'em?

Okudera: Yes, and from here on out, keep the chatter to a minimum, Lets use hand signals. Okay, listen. If you spot some deer, approach them from behind carefully. Get as close as possible, then shoot. Got that?

Saejima: Yup.

[They are tracking a pack of wild deer.]

Saejima: There they are.

Okudera: Crouch down and sneak closer. Shoot when you're close enough. Experienced hunters aim for the heart, but that's a difficult thing for beginners. For you, it'll be easier to aim for the head. Target the one that presents you with the best shot. Go ahead.

[Saejima squats down and sneaks up to a pack of deer. He raises his rifle and takes aim. His breathing is intermittent and his hands are trembling a little, for killing is not easy. With good aim, he shoots and kills the animal.]

Saejima: Yes! Got it.

Okudera: Well done. That's how you hunt. Now collect what you can from the kill.

[Saejima reloads his rifle and approaches the deer he shot. With the magic of videogames, the deer simply disappears, sparing us the scenes of freshing and butchering the meat.]

Okudera: Good. You've collected what you can. Don't waste those items... Never forget that you took an animals life to get them.

Saejima: Yeah. I understand. (Gotta give this deer meat to Nishina's wife. Better put it in my Valuables to keep it safe.)

Okudera: So do you want to keep hunting, or go back to the village? Your call. I’m fine either way.

[Saejia hunts a bit more.]

Okudera: Baba's waiting for us. Let's head back.

[They return to the Okudera’s hut.]

Okudera: You made it back safely. The mountain was kind to you. Tell me when you decide to go hunting again. Until then, I'll hold on to your rifle. Okay?

Saejima: Sure, nice of ya.

Baba: Welcome back, Aniki. I feel rotten for being the reason why you gotta hunt in the cold… I wish I didn't have to be laid up. I'm so sorry. 

Saejima: It's nothin' to apologize for.

Okudera: You mentioned you had a favor to return... To someone who gave you some food, I believe. So are you gonna go do that or not?

Saejima: (He's right. Gotta go see Nishina-san.)

Okudera: I teach you how to trap rabbits when you get back.

Saejima: Why? Ain't much meat on those li’l critters. Why not try for deer?

Okudera: Rabbit meat is much more tender. It'll be easier for Baba to digest. The fur will be very useful as well.

Saejima: Well, you'd know best.

Okudera: Go take care of your business. I’ll make some rabbit snares. They'll be finished by the time you get back.

[Saejima leaves the hut and goes to Nishina’s hut.]

Kimiyo: How did your hunt go?

Saejima: Thanks to you, I think l can make a go of it—‘preciate yer help. In fact, I’d like to repay my debt to ya. Here, take this.

Kimiyo: (chickles) Oh wow, you saved some for us?

Saejima: Yeah. Bein' in debt doesn't sit well with me. Not sure if that's enough, though.

Kimiyo: Oh, no, this is plenty. Thank you. (bows) I guess you'll be going into the wild again... Please be careful.

Saejima: I do that. Thanks.

[He gets back to Okudera’s hut.]

Okudera: You're back. You done now?

Saejima: Yeah.

Okudera: Good. We'll go trapping, then. For rabbits. That's the best food for Baba. It’ll help him get his strength back.

Baba: I'm sorry, Aniki. To require so much of you.

Saejima: Don't worry about it.

Okudera: Anyway, I made some snares. Are you ready to go to the mountain?

Yup, ready to go. ✓
Need some more time.

Saejima: Yeah. Ready.

Okudera: All right, let's get a move on.

[They change into hunting clothes, take their rifles, and leave the hut. They notice a man in a yellow jacket on the road, standing next to a small truck.]

Saejima: Huh, didn't know anybody owned trucks here.

Okudera: None of the villagers do. The guy with the truck is a trader who visits us to conduct business. He must be stuck here because of the road closure. We sell him animal skins and meat, and he sells us goods from the city. Even in this place, commerce is everything.

Saejima: Yeah, just like everywhere else. Guess ril be doin' business with him myself soon.

Okudera: So go introduce yourself. If you're going to be working with somebody, it's always best to know each other's names.

[Saejima approaches the yellow jacket guy.]

Saejima: Got a minute?

Trader: Yes, of course. How can I help you?

Saejima: Ya do business here, dontcha? Thought I’d introduce myself, since I’ve just started huntin’, which means I'll be needin yer services soon 'nuff.

Trader: Oh, I see. Pleased to make your acquaintance—I was wondering who the muscly new guy was! It's been quite a while since any newcomers were around.

Saejima: Makes sense, in a place like this.

Trader: “In a place like this”? You know, this mountain is actually pretty famous, because of the outstanding quality of its animal meats and skins.

Saejima: That so?

Trader: Oh, yes. The meat is prized at the most high-end restaurants in Tokyo, and the skins trade at high prices inside the most luxurious fur stores. I mean, I assumed that's why you were hunting here in the first place.

Saejima: Uh, ya might say that. I knew there was choice game, but I didn't know it was that good.

Trader: It's some of the best around! Heck, ten years ago, hunters would come up here all the way from Honshu. It's not quite like that anymore, though.

Saejima: (Ten years ago? That's when Okudera-han started livin' in the village, right after he was rescued.)

Trader: Still, the primo quality of wild game on this mountain remains unmatched. That's why I still come here to trade.

Saejima: Well, lookin' forward to doin' business with ya.

Okudera: You ready to go, Saejima?

Saejima: Yeah, sure.

[They go to the mountains. Before the hunt begins, Okudera stops to teach Saejima how to use the traps.]

Okudera: Today I’ll show you how to trap small game. It doesn't involve any shooting, so don't worry about your rifle. You have to use different traps for different animals. Today we’ll catch rabbits. For them, we use snares.

Saejima: Got it. Rabbits, snares.

Okudera: Yeah. You can also catch martens and foxes around here, but well save them for another time. So, this is a snare. When the animal steps in it, the wire tightens around its foot. You can use mine today, but remember to bring your own for next time.

Saejima: ‘Preciate it.

Okudera: Traps are reusable, but they can break. Just repair them if that happens. The key to successful trapping is placement. You have to look for a good trap site.

Saejima: Where do I find those? So... I gotta trek around in the snow until I find a site?

Okudera: Nobody ever said a hunter's life was easy. Go on, now. Lead the way.

Saejima: Alright.

[They walk through the snow covered forest for a few minutes.]

Okudera: Saejima—over there!

Saejima: Hm?

Okudera: That's a trap site. There are many like it on the mountain. You just have to find them and set up traps on them. Go ahead and set up a snare.

Saejima: Sure. (I can set a trap here. Should I set a trap here?) Yeah, let's set a snare here. This’ll do.

Okudera: Good. Now that thať's done, we should go. Animals won't come near it if there are people around. You should always go somewhere else before looping back around to check your traps. You never know what can happen. Game might get snared even while you're walking around other trap sites. Then again, it might not. Set traps at good sites, and be patient.

Saejima: Got it.

Okudera: It should go without saying, but make sure you actually collect trapped game. We're hunters, not indiscriminate killers. Do you understand that?

Saejima: I do.

Okudera: Good. Why don't we look for some more trap sites?

[Saejima set some more traps.]

Okudera: It appears you're getting the hang of things. Let's look around for the next trap site. By the way, watch your health while you're on the mountain. You need to eat food to keep up your strength, and if things start looking bad, don't push your luck. You really don't want to be surviving solely on the meat of whatever you hunt, since that's never a sure thing. Always, always, always pack food for your trips up the mountain.

Saejima: I’ll do that.

[He wants to go further into the forest…]

Okudara: This area is fine for teaching you how to trap. No need to go deeper into the wild. Whenever you're out here, always be wary of bears. Yama-oroshi is the obvious danger, but other bears are nothing to be trifled with, either.

Saejima: I figured that.

Okudera: That's right, you already know how fearsome they are. Yes, they certainly don't need Yama-oroshi's size to satisfy their hunger for human flesh… If you happen upon a bear, you might be tempted to run from it, but that's not the best idea. They will always give chase, and they can outrun any man. You're better off calmly dodging their attacks until they give up. Or shooting them, of course. If you're going to shoot though, you should know that your very life depends on dropping it with just one bullet. Nothing is more dangerous than an injured bear. I don't expect you to know where a bear's heart is. Aim for its head.

Saejima: I’ll remember that.

Okudera: Good. Now, then. We've set traps at all the sites in this area. Now we just wait until they are sprung. And you can use any spare traps as you see fit.

Saejima: Got it.

[Saejima goes to check the traps he set.]

Saejima: (Nice. Caught a rabbit. Let's pull this trap.) I'm grateful. There! We got ourselves a rabbit.

Okudera: See, that's all there is to it—suit the trap to the game.

Saejima: I getcha.

Okudera: Well, you're a proper rookie hunter now, so I'll treat you as such. From now on, you do the prepwork and hunt your own food. You feel okay with that?

Saejima: Alright wit’ me.

Okudera: Good. Let's make our way down and bring this rabbit to Baba.

Saejima: Fine idea.

Bear Roar: Gwroooaaar!

Okudera: That roar…!

Saejima: Is it Yama-oroshi!?

[Not far away we see a huge bear digging in the snow.]

Okudera: Saejima, run. I’ll hold him off.

Saejima: What're ya talkin' about? Ya can't even shoot right now, I'll deal with the beast. Just stick near me while I do.

Okudera: Argh… Listen. You can't outrun or kill him, so don't even try. Just concentrate on fending him off.

Saejima: Fine. Just keep yerself safe, Okudera-han!

[The unequal battle with the bear begins!]

Okudera: Don't let him get close to the village! Stop him here!

[The bear knocks Okudera to the ground.]

Saejima: Okudera-han!

Okudera: Gah!

[The bear, who has lost interest in his attackers, walks away.]

Saejima: He's leavin'. Okudera-han, are ya alright?

Okudera: I’m fine. *groan* 

Saejima: No, yer not fine…

Okudera: This is nothing. Let's just go back to the village.

[They return to Okudera’s hut.]

Okudera: Never thought I’d have to be rescued by anyone. I'm getting old.

Saejima: I'm just glad yer safe. You're like a mentor to me, Okudera-han.

Okudera: Hmph. Let's eat. Baba there must be hungry.

[They sit around the fire, put stew in bowls and start eating.]

Baba: This is… good, I think. It's not as gamey as I thought it would be. Yep, yep, tasty. Real tasty.

Saejima: Can't say I like it myself… Just tastes lean and dry. But that's rabbit for ya.

Baba: I feel like it's making my strength return, at least.

Okudera: Seems you're well on the way to recovery, Baba.

Baba: Yes. I... I really want to thank you both. For everything. I'm very grateful.

Okudera: Saejima, good news about your cold weather clothes. I used the rabbit's skin to patch them up. Would you like to try them on?

[Saejima tries on his upgraded outfit.]

Saejima: Real warm. Downright cozy.

Okudera: That’ll slow down your energy loss on the mountain.

Saejima: Thank you, Okudera-han.

Okudera: Don't thank me. You're the one who caught the rabbit, and risked your life to do so.

Saejima: Hmph, modest as always.

Baba: Heh. That's for sure.

Okudera: So be it, then.

[He stands up.]

Saejima: Where ya goin' now?

Okudera: To check on the village. I want to see if the road is still closed from the snow. Surely you two have something to do yourselves?

Saejima: Yah. How bout I go instead of you? Can't have my own mentor doin my work for me. ‘Sides, Okudera-han, ya can't be over yer injuries already. Ya still need rest.

Okudera: Hmph. Well, do as you will.

[Saejima changes his clothes.]

Okudera: How's the village? Saejima, go see if they've plowed the snow from the road.

Saejima: Baba-chan, how ya feelin’?

Baba: Much better, thanks to you. I can make it down the mountain, at least. Let's go when the road re-opens.

Saejima: All right. Jus' don't overexert yourself.

[He leaves the hut.]

Villager: Hey, you're that lost fellow Okudera-san found.

Saejima: Sure am. Ya want somethin’?

Villager: Don't know how long you're staying here, or why you'd even want to stay long… but there's something you ought to know about our village. Up past here, there's a small shrine. They say it was built at the same time as the village, to provide protection. Now, a strange old fellow named Tendo calls it home. You have to watch out for him.

Saejima: How strange are we talkin’?

Villager: Like beyond strange. He looks like a sage out of a storybook, and rumor has it he can use sorcery.

Saejima: Heh. You believe in that stuff?

Villager: If you're really not scared, then go see him for yourself! But don't say I didn't warn you.

Saejima: (A sorcerer in a mountain shrine, huh? Sounds interestin'.)

[He goes to the shrine.]

Saejima: (This the shrine the villagers were talkin' about? Don't see no sage round here.)

???: Make an offering from the heart, and the mountain gods will share with you their wisdom.

Saejima: Huh? Who said that? ……I know I ain't just hearin' things. (So I'm supposed to make an offering? Question is, what? The voice said something about mountain gods, so maybe they want something natural from the mountain. I should buy some vegetables from the village.)

[After going to Okudera's hut and retrieving the skin of a recently caught rabbit, Saejima notices a group of hunters gathered nearby discussing something.]

Sakurai: Nishina-san still hasn't come back.

Male Villager: We should probably accept that Nishina-san and Kihachi are both… you know…

Sakurai: No! Nishina-san would never screw up that bad, and neither would Kihachi. They're alive, I know it!

Male Villager: But...

Get Involved ✓
Stay Out of It

Saejima: Somethin’ the matter, Sakurai-han?

Sakurai: Did you hear? One of our hunters, Kihachi, never came down from the mountain. And Nishina-san went to find him, but now they're both missing!

Saejima: Anyone aside from Nishina-han go out searchin’?

Sakurai: No... because...

Saejima: Lemme guess. People're scared of Yama-oroshi?

Sakurai: Well. They're right to be scared.

Saejima: What about Nishina-han's missus? She know about it?

Sakurai: Of course. But she acts like nothing's wrong 'cause she's one hell of a strong woman.

Saejima: Hmm.

Saejima: Any idea where the hunter Kihachi was going?

Sakurai: No, but I'm sure he wouldn't have gone far. He's not that dumb.

Saejima: Well, that's somethin'.

Sakurai: And hopefully you're not dumb, either... Don't get any ideas about going up that mountain. All we can do now is wait. We shouldn't let the mountain swallow up anybody else.

Saejima: (There's wisdom there, but... In any case, think I’ll go see Nishina's wife.)

[He goes to Nishina's hut and sees his wife standing in the cold, staring sadly into the distance.]

Kimiyo: My poor husband…

Saejima: (Nishina-san's helped me out before. Can't sit by doin squat while she suffers. I'll talk to Okudera-han, and then I'm gonna go find her man.)

[White Darkness mission added. Saejima goes to check on Okudera.]

Okudera: How's the village? Saejima, go see if they've plowed the snow from the road.

[After that, Saejima goes to Sakurai.]

Sakurai: Nishina-san was worrying himself into a frenzy… We should avoid that, so we don't do anything brash. They'll be okay, Im sure of it…

Villager Past His Prime: Ah, you're the one staying at Okudera-san's. Perhaps you've heard… the road is finally open again. But you'll need to watch yourself if you travel on it… People are saying Yama-oroshi's nearby. And there are children here. Frightening, isn't it?

Trader: Ah, just the man I wanted to see! I heard about how you sent Yama-oroshi running. Pretty impressive. With those kind of hunting skills, I was wondering if I could ask a favor of you.

Saejima: What is it?

Trader: Well, because of the Yama-oroshi trouble, all the hunters around here are reluctant to hunt on the mountain.

Saejima: Can't blame 'em, with that beast roamin' around.

Trader: Of course, of course. I can certainly understand. But it's made it very difficult for me to source any merchandise. But maybe you, if you go to the mountain, would be willing to sell me any game you bag? It could be meat, hides, or even vegetation. What do you think?

Saejima: Don't get yer hopes up. I don't plan on goin' on any huntin' sprees.

Trader: Oh, I understand. I wasn't asking for reckless slaughter or anything! I have to maintain a good relationship with this village too, you know.

Saejima: Alright. I'll do what I can. How much game do ya need?

Trader: Not much… About a million yen worth. {One million yen is about $7230.}

Saejima: A million yen! I can't imagine what it'd take to equal that!

Trader: Not as much as you'd think. Don't worry you’ll see what the prices are really like once you bring me a few things. I’m counting on you! (bows)

["Supply the Trader" was added to the list of missions.]

Trader: So, can I help you with anything today? Can I help you with anything else? Thank you. Your business is always appreciated.

[Saejima returns to Okidera's hut. He sits down by the fire beside him.]

Okudera: How was it?

Saejima: The road's been reopened.

Okudera: Good. You can leave town now. Baba will be fine.

Saejima: But isn't Yama-oroshi still roamin' the mountain?

Okudera: That's my problem.

Saejima: All right. …Lemme ask ya somethin'.

Okudera: What?

Saejima: Why do ya keep after Yama-oroshi?

Okudera: That's really none of your concern. Let it be.

Saejima: Okay. I get the feelin' that some day you're gonna end up tellin' me anyway. 'Cause we're alike in certain ways, ya know.

Okudera: Hmph. You're entitled to your opinion. But for now, you can hurry off to Tsukimino, or stay and hunt. Just let me know what you decide.

Saejima: Sure. Kihachi's gone missin', and Nishina-han's out lookin' for him. But Nishina-han ain't been back, and nobody else wants to go search for them. Guess l do it.

Okudera: You think you know better than these people? They've lived on the mountain for decades. Don't you think they might have a reason for not wanting to go? (Hadn't thought of that, but…)

Okudera: Of course, I can see you're not one for talking sense. But you really might die. Do you understand that?

Saejima: Yeah. I do.

Okudera: Well then, go get your gear together. You can use my gun and shells. My only advice is that whatever happens out there… Stay alert.

[Saejima changes clothes and picks up his rifle.]

Okudera: Ready for the mountain? Fine. Go, then.

[Saejima goes out into the snow-covered forest.]

Saejima: (I'll start with areas I’ve already visited. Should be signs of him somewhere… maybe footprints.)

[Checking the traps, he finds footprints.]

Saejima: (Footprints. But from just one person… Must be Nishina-han or Kihachi. Looks like they never found each other, I should follow these tracks.)

[Following the trail, he finds a man sitting by a tree. He appears to be severely hypothermic.]

Nearly Frostbitten Man: Who is that…?

Saejima: You all right, man? You Kihachi-han?

Kihachi: Ah, it's… it's you. What are you doing here?

Saejima: Put that outta your mind for now. Ya seen Nishina-han anywhere? He came out here lookin' for ya.

Kihachi: Uh, no, I haven't seen him.

Saejima: Okay. First things first, you need rescuin'. Can ya walk?

Kihachi: I don't think so. I'm not hurt that bad. It's just… I'm so cold…

Saejima: (He's really weak. Better give him some food. What do I wanna give?)

Saejima: Here, eat this. It’ll perk ya up. And don't fall asleep! That’ll kill ya.

Kihachi: Mm… that really helps. Thank you, Thank you so much.

Saejima: Don't worry 'bout it. You're in need. (Damn, it's turned into a blizzard now. Can't see a thing.)

Kihachi: This is it… This is how I die…

Saejima: Hey, don't give up! (Can't go anywhere with the weather like this… I'll get lost. Sakurai-han was right… I was stupid to come up here.) Hey, we're gonna ride out this blizzard together, ya got that? I'll be right here. Just hang on, Kihachi. Nishina-han's out here somewhere, lookin' for ya. We gotta put our faith in him, now!

Kihachi: Okay…

[Some time passes. Saejima and Kihachi lie exhausted on the snow.]

Saejima: (Blizzard's still ragin' like an angry wife with a fryin' pan. Damn, my arms and legs feel heavy… This… could be the end. Can't… stay awake…)

[He closes his eyes… and wakes up in Okudera's hut lying on a futon.]

Okudera: You're awake.

Saejima: Okudera-han…

Okudera: Don't thank me. Nishina's the one you should thank.

Saejima: Didn't mean to be a burden… Sorry.

Okudera: You should be. Kihachi was grateful, though.

Saejima: Heh, a silver lining to the fact I couldn't even save myself.

Okudera: Forget silver linings-let it be a lesson! By the way, I've got your gun and shells here. So don't worry about them; just focus on resting up.

Saejima: Alright…

[Saejima wakes up after a little rest and leaves the hut. Sakurai meets him at the threshold.]

Sakurai: Hmph.

Saejima: Sorry I made things worse, Sakurai-han. I got cocky… Thought I could take on the mountain.

Sakurai: Mm-hm. Well, kinda figured a city-dweller wasn't going to take my words seriously. But still, you're something else. You put your life on the line, without any hesitation. It's almost like…

Saejima: Like what?

Sakurai: Uh, nothing. Just please take care. There's bravery, sure, but then there's recklessness.

Saejima: True.

Sakurai: All right, I’m done lecturing you! There's something else I want to talk to you about. See that man there? Do you know him?

[In the distance we see a man with a blond mustache and a short beard, dressed in a red jacket. Behind his back hangs a bundle. He looks around.]

Sakurai: He came here because he heard the rumors about a giant bear.

Saejima: Must be Yama-oroshi.

Sakurai: Right. And look at that case on his back; there must be a huge rifle in there! But how did he hear the rumors in the first place? When outsiders arrive one after the other like this, well… We townspeople get to wondering why.

Saejima: Look, I don't know the guy.

Sakurai: Oh. I see. Well, if he's going after Yama-oroshi, that could be trouble…

[Saejima goes around the village to talk to the villagers.]

Kimiyo: You're better already?

Saejima: I'm sorry. I only caused yer husband more trouble.

Kimiyo: No, you did your best to help. You are so kind-hearted… maybe too much so, haha! Please, listen to us when we say that the mountain is a frightful, dangerous place.

Saejima: Yeah, I learned that lesson the hard way.

Masao: Hm? Do you want something?

Saejima: Ya leavin' the village?

Masao: Well, yes. I'm leaving for Tsukimino. I don't want to be stuck here forever.

Saejima: That so? Ya know, it's bad for the village to be losin' so many young people.

Masao: I know that. But I'm so sick of this place. I can't stand how boring it is.

Masao's Mother: Masao…

Masao: You're Saejima-san, aren't you? Aren't you from some big city yourself? Which one?

Saejima: What's the use of knowin' that?

Masao: Because, like, you get why I want to leave, right? You know how cool the big city is. My dad wouldn't listen to anything I said about it. Every time I brought it up, he'd just smack me and say becoming a hunter was my only choice. That's why I'm running away.

Saejima: Runnin' away?

Masao's Mother: My husband doesn't know that Masao is leaving. He would never allow it.

Saejima: Ya realize yer pa's gonna blow his stack when he finds out.

Masao: What, are you trying to stop me?

Saejima: Nah. This ain't the sort of thing for strangers to meddle in.

Masao: Agreed. Well, it's now or never. I need to be gone before dad gets back.

Masao's Mother: *sob* Remember you can always come home.

Masao: It'll be okay, Mom. I'm eighteen now. Have a little faith in me. Goodbye.

Masao's Mother: My son…

Saejima: (Hope the kid does all right for himself.)

Kihachi: Oh, hey! Saejima-san, right? You and Nishina-san saved my life! Thank you.

Saejima: Nah, Nishina-han alone saved ya. And he saved me, too. I was jus' a burden in the end.

Kihachi: But you gave me food, and hope! Here, take this.

Saejima: But…

Kihachi: Go on, take it. Please, it would make me happy!

Saejima: Oh, all right. 'Preciate it.

[Saejima got Leghold Trap.]

Kihachi: We got lucky this time. Be careful out there.

Saejima: Yeah. I will.

Trader: Oh, hi there. Say, have you heard the story about the Jizo statues?

Saejima: What's this, now?

Trader: Well, there are these twelve Jizo statues on the mountain.

Saejima: What is this, some kinda ghost story?

Trader: Oh no, no, not at al! In fact, I’m talking about beneficial spirits. You see, in the old days, hunters would pray to a Jizo statue if they happened to come across one. It makes sense that the hunters were superstitious. I mean, the mountain is such a dangerous place… But what if it worked? Some people have sworn that the Jizo statues kept them from getting lost in the wild.

Saejima: It ain't hard to understand why folks turn to superstition.

Trader: Well, if you ask me, it can't hurt. If I came across a Jizo statue up there, I’d pray to it. Why not?

Saejima: Uh-huh…

["Pray to Jizo Statues" was added to the list of missions.]

Trader: So, would you like anything today?

[And finally, Saejima approaches the stranger in the red jacket.]

Stranger: So you're the other stranger in town.

Saejima: What makes ya say that?

Stranger: (laughs) You really gotta ask? Take a look in the mirror sometime, buddy. So… Are you after this bear, too?

Saejima: Yama-oroshi?

Stranger: Hah, I knew it! You are here for him. Well then, I guess we're rivals! I'm Narumi. You might wanna remember my name and face, 'cause they're gonna be on the cover of every hunting magazine in Japan! And you are?

Saejima: Saejima. Ya won't see it anywhere, if I'm lucky.

Narumi: Hahaha, you're a funny guy, Saejima! Hey, maybe I'll see you on the mountain, yeah? Bring your biggest gun…

["The Third Man" was added.]

Saejima: (That meathead seemed bent on going up the mountain. I'd better tell Okudera-han.)

Trader: Oh, Saejima-san. I was wondering if you could help me.

Saejima: Whaddya need?

Trader: Uh, could I possibly buy a marten pelt off you? I'll offer double what I usually pay.

Saejima: In a bind?

Trader: Kind of. One of my regular customers in Tokyo just sent me an urgent order for a marten pelt. If I can't fill it quickly, they're going to stop doing business with me. It's totally unreasonable, but at the same time… It's one of my best customers, so I don't want to lose 'im.

Saejima: Well since I need yer business myself, I’ll see what I can do.

Trader: Oh, that would be such a big help… Naturally, since it's for such an important customer, I'll have to inspect it carefully before buying. Not that I don't trust you! But just to be safe, please deliver it personally to me. Okay?

["Sell a Marten Pelt" was added to the list of missions.]

Trader: So, anything I can help you with right now? Can I help you with anything else? Thank you. Your business is always appreciated.

Marten Furrier: Oh, hey. Listen, you got a minute?

Saejima: Whaddya want?

Marten Furrier: Heard you're going hunting. Is it true?

Saejima: So what if it is?

Marten Furrier: Well, could I trouble you to trap some martens?

Saejima: Martens?

Marten Furrier: Yeah. They're like weasels. They're my primary source of income, because the ones around here have such gorgeous fur. But it's been so dangerous up there lately… and I don't have a gun - only traps. So it would be suicide for me to go up there.

Saejima: So ya want me to get some for ya? Sorry, but I ain't riskin' my life for you.

Marten Furrier: But you're going up there anyway! And l pay you handsomely. Please, I'm begging you!

Saejima: …Guess I'll nab some if I feel like it.

Marten Furrier: You will You're a lifesaver! Three pelts is all I need. Thank you so much!

["Get Marten Pelts" was added to the list of missions.]

Saejima: (To catch martens, I'll hafta use cage traps.)

[Remembering the hermit, he goes to the shrine.]

Saejima: (Should I try making an offering? What do I wanna give?)

Saejima: ……

Mysterious Voice: Very well, I shall grace you with the voices of the heavens.


Saejima: Huh?

[As from nowhere an old man in ancient traditional Japanese clothing appears behind his back.]

White-haired Elder: Hohoho!

Saejima: Who're you?

White-haired Elder: Me? I'm the one they call Tendo.

Saejima: Tendo, huh? Guess I shouldn't be surprised. You definitely got the look of a sage.

Tendo: A sage? Well, I could see how people might think that. But truth be told, it is not that simple, for I am a being both animate and inanimate.

Saejima: Ya lost me already. Whatever, just tell me what you're doin' here.

Tendo: Well, you see, this shrine is the dwelling of the mountain gods. These mighty deities are the very creators of this mountain. As for me, I train each day to be able to hear their voices.

Saejima: You can hear what the gods say? Is that even possible?

Tendo: The whispering wind, the babbling brook, the creaking tree… They're all murmurings of the gods. Heed their call and open your mind. Oh, and make an offering to the gods while you're at it.

Saejima: Uh… An offering?

Tendo: What did you expect? The gods don't offer their wisdom for nothing. As you sow, so you shall reap, and all that.

Saejima: Right. I think I get it.

Tendo: I imagine it is power you seek. Great strength that will take you to the next level.

Saejima: Strength? What're you talking about?

Tendo: No, no, say no more. I know what is in your heart.

Saejima: Is that right?

Tendo: I will help you hear the voices of the heavens. And in so doing, I just might bring myself one step closer to my own enlightenment.

Saejima: So lemme get this straight. If I make an offering, I can ask you to make me more powerful?

Tendo: Yes, that's the gist of it. You are quite perceptive, I must say.

Saejima: And if I ain't sure what to offer, I can ask you?

Tendo: Just so. Do that, and the mountain gods will surely answer your prayers.

Saejima: Can't help but feel like you're takin' me for a ride, old man. But what the hell, I'll give ita try. Fine. I'll be back after I get some offerings and stuff.

Tendo: Excellent. I'll be waiting.

[Saejima returns to Okudera's hut to prepare to go into the forest.]

Okudera: What is it, Saejima?

Saejima: (We'll finish sayin' goodbye to Okudera-han, and then head to Tsukimino.)

[Saejima to drop everything and get to town with Baba as soon as possible.]

Okudera: You're leaving?

Saejima: Yeah. But I might be back… Still gotta wheedle out of ya why you hate Yama-oroshi so much.

Okudera: Hmph. Do as you please.

[They get dressed and go outside.]

Saejima: We owe ya so much. If not for you, Baba and I'd be bear food by now.

Baba: Yes, thank you so much!

Okudera: I won't ask how you ended up here, completely lost with no explanation of where you came from. I won't even ask what you plan to do once you get to the city.

Saejima: ……

Okudera: But never forget this: Killing is only justified during the hunt, or when protecting one's life. Do you understand?

Saejima: I'll live by it.

Baba: Aniki… we, um, should go.

Saejima: Take care, Okudera-han.

[He and Baba leave the village.]

Chapter 4: RECKLESS ENCOUNTER
Tsukimono, Hokkaido

[Saejima and Baba walk down a wide city street and come to a crossroads. An announcement comes from the loudspeakers.]

Newscaster: Final preparations for Tsukimino's Snow Festival are underway at Main Street Park, where many are working hurriedly to finish before tomorrow night's opening. Each year, the famous winter event attracts a sizable number of visitors from across Japan. Local businesses are looking forward to this much-needed influx of tourist money. And now, an update on the penitentiary fire. The Prefectural Police made an announcement regarding the two missing convicts. The remains of one convict were found this morning in the mountains surrounding the prison. An arrest warrant has been issued for the other inmate, thought to still be in the area.

[On the huge screen of the intersection, a photo appears…]

Newscaster: That inmate's name is Taiga Saejima, a former member of the Tojo Clan, and wanted nationwide. Acting on tips that Saejima may appear in Sapporo, the police have gone on full alert in the Tsukimino area.

Saejima: (Dammit…)

Baba: There was a fire at Abashiri? And that body they found… who was that?

Saejima: Hmm.

Baba: Uh, by the way, the hideout's ready.

[They leave the open street into a quiet alley.]

Baba: I took a look around. It's not good. There are a lot of cops. It's too risky to use the main road to go straight to the hideout.

Saejima: So what now?

Baba: I'll go on ahead. You follow me, but at a distance. We'll try not to draw attention.

Saejima: Gotcha.

[Saejima follows Baba, who has gone a few meters ahead, with a slow and calm pace.]

Saejima: Hold up. There's a cop.

Baba: Damn. Can't go this way.

Saejima: Baba, you saw the news. My face is plastered everywhere. If we stay together, you'll get burned, too. Let's split up and meet at yer hideout.

Baba: But then you…

Saejima: Don't worry 'bout me. I'm used to this sorta thing. How's yer pain? Still as bad as it was on the mountain?

Baba: Uh, I…

Saejima: This cold's real bad if you're in pain. Hurry on to the hideout. Ya got your own health to worry about before ya go motherin' me.

Baba: Aniki… …Okay, I do that. I’m sorry, Aniki.

Saejima: So, where's this hideout?

Baba: There's a major street that runs north to south through the town center. It's called Central Station Boulevard, and there's a Don Quijote on it. The hideout is a bar called Polaris, in the building across the street.

Saejima: Gotcha. I'll see ya later.

Baba: Please be careful, Aniki.

Saejima: (All right, across the street from Don Quijote on Central Station: Boulevard. Can't be that hard to find.)

[Saejima gets to the place.]

Baba: Saejima-san! What a relief. Did you have trouble getting here?

Saejima: Nah. So, this the hideout you were talkin' about?

Baba: Yes. It's just up here.

[They walk into an old, long-abandoned bar.]

Baba: This is the place.

Saejima: Surprised ya remembered where it was.

Baba: I used to come here all the time. One of my brothers ran it. I was hoping it would still have a spark of life left, but the only life here now is the rats. Not that it matters. This works out just fine for us. 

[He pushes back one of the chairs by the bar, raising a puff of dust.]

Baba: (cough) Please. Nice and clean for you. It's only been ten years, but Tsukimino's practically a whole new city. Bars like this used to own the town. Sad to see how far the mighty have fallen.

Saejima: Got that right. This one musta gone under years ago.

[Baba is rummaging through the bar stock.]

Baba: Found it! The Macallan 1946. Just a second.

[He puts two glasses on the bar and uncorks the bottle.]

Baba: It should be fine to drink. The seal wasn't broken or anything.

[They clink and drink.]

Baba: Damn, that's good!

Saejima: Real good.

Baba: It's pretty crazy, right? We should be out on parole right now, but instead we're runaways, drinking at a place like this, jumpy as rat…

Saejima: Hey. I was lookin' forward to havin' a drink with you anyway. So this ain't so bad.

Baba: Why do you think they put out a warrant for you and not for me? They just made me into an anonymous dead body. They didn't even broadcast my name! What the hell does that mean?

Saejima: (No idea, kid…)

Baba: Is the Tojo Clan behind all of this? Behind this manhunt and what happened in prison…? Oh, guess you don't want to think about that…

Saejima: Just gonna go take care of some things.

Baba: Huh? You're not afraid of being recognized?

Saejima: Can't live life in fear. And I've got stuff to do.

Baba: But it's teeming with cops out there!

Saejima: I'm used to it. Dealt with the same thing two years ago.

Baba: What's so important? Are you going to try and get intel on the Kitakata Family?

Saejima: Kinda necessary, doncha think? If we wanna find their boss.

Baba: Well, in that case, you'll want to try a joint called Ambitious. Kitakata guys used to hang there. They probably still do.

Saejima: Ambitious, ya said?

Baba: Yeah, the family runs a casino in the back room. It's been there for years. If you tip the bartender, he'll take you to the casino.

Saejima: And then it'll just be a simple thing to get the down low, right? Heh.

Baba: So simple. But on a serious note… please be careful. The Kitakata Family is old school. If they decide you're an enemy, they don't hold back. They're a bunch of hardliners not afraid to die for the old man.

Saejima: All the more fun.

Baba: At least take this with you.

Saejima: A phone?

Baba: I got it through an old connection. It's prepaid, and untraceable.

Saejima: Thanks.

[Saejima walks toward the exit of the bar.]

Baba: Aniki.

Saejima: Hm?

Baba: I've got cash. Take some.

[Saejima got 30,000 yen.]

{It is about $220.}

Saejima: This from an old connection in town?

Baba: You could say that. There's no telling what might happen, so…

Saejima: That's true. 'Preciate it.

[Saejima comes out of the bar and sees a young man in light clothing standing in the cold.]

Chilly Man: Brr… Hokkaido sure is cold. I hope I find a good place soon. Hopefully a really warm one, too.

Saejima: (What's with him? Wait, haven't I seen that guy before?)

[He gets several e-mails on his phone.]

[E-mail]
To my international friends
best_friend@…
Hello, my friends all over the world! I have a request for you today. Lately I haven't been able to take any of the perfect shots that I long for!
But I had an idea! I want all of you to upload any perfect shots you take to the image hosting site that I built!
Seeing themn is bound to inspire me! Do me proud out there, everyone! Adieu!

[E-mail]
Your fortune
Lucky Service
Your luck today is terrible. Things won't be going your way, so avoid anything involving luck.

Saejima: (What's with this email? Some kinda mistake? Guess I'll check it out when I get time.)

Chilly Man: Brr… Ugh…

Saejima: Hey, you there. I can't shake the felin' I've seen you before. What's your name?

Chilly Man: Ever hear of that celebrity chef Tatsuya? Well, that's me. Maybe you've seen me on TV or something.

Saejima: Oh, right. That's where I've seen you. You're some kinda cooking master, ain't you?

Tatsuya: Well, I'm not just a cook, exactly. These days, I’m doing this spot on a TV show where I help out local eateries across Japan by coming up with new dishes!

Saejima: I don't get it. If you got ideas for new dishes, why don't you use 'em at your own restaurant?

Tatsuya: But that's the whole idea for the program, helping others with my new dishes. With that in mind, I have to ask. Could you recommend any eateries here in Tsukimino?

Saejima: I ain't from around here, so I really can't say.

Tatsuya: Oh, you're a tourist? Ah, no matter. I still have to ask. Would you let me know if you find a great place that serves local cuisine here in Tsukimino? I'll go try it out, and hopefully it will help me come up with an idea for a new dish.

Saejima: You want me to find tasty eats for you? Ain't that your job?

Tatsuya: Sure, but there's a limit to how much one person can do. I'll take all the help I can get.

Saejima: You got a point there.

Tatsuya: Think of it as a good deed! But I understand if you're too busy.

Saejima: Fine. I'll give you a hand if I get around to it.

Tatsuya: (bows) Thank you! And don't worry. I'll make it worth your while! I'll use my vast experience with both cooking food and eating it to teach you how to make the most of your meals.

Saejima: Fine, fine. I'll let ya know if I find anything.

Tatsuya: Great, thanks! I'm looking forward to your recommendations! Stop by and see me.

[E-mail]
Tatsuya
This is Tatsuya the chef! If you come across any good restaurants in Tsukimino, be sure to tell me! I'll be waiting near Don Quijote!

[Saejima walks further down the street and sees the crowd gathered.]

Saejima: (What's goin' on there? An accident?)

[Two trucks collided on the road, one of which overturned.]

Middle-aged Onlooker: A couple of trucks crashed. But no one's hurt, by the look of things.

Driver: Help! Someone call the police!

Saejima: (The police are comin'. Better make myself scarce.)

Mysterious Growl: Roooar!

Saejima: What the---!

Young Onlooker: Oh, my gosh! Bear! A bear came out of the truck!

Driver: It's a bear from the zoo! Everyone run! Call the police!

Middle-aged Onlooker: Bear! Everyone, move! Run!

Young Woman: Uh… Someone…

Saejima: Hey! Over here! This one's like a teddy bear compared to Yama-oroshi.

Driver: Hey, you! Get away! What are you thinking?

Young Woman: You…

Saejima: Heh, bring it on. I don't mind ya!

[Saejima fights the bear with his bare hands and wins.]

Young Woman: Thank you so much. You saved us.

Saejima: You all right? That was close.

Driver: Sir, if it weren't for you, this would have been a terrible disaster. I don't have the words to thank you. This isn't very much, but we want you to have it.

[Saejima got 30,000 yen.]

{It is about $220.}

Driver: And if you're willing, we'd love for you to meet our managers at the zoo. They'll want to thank you in person.

Saejima: (Can't stick around. Don't want the cops to notice me.) Sorry, I gotta get goin'.

Driver: Oh, but… It's all because of you that no one got hurt…

Saejima: Yeah, but it's fine. I'll just accept yer thanks and be on my way. (walks away)

Driver: What a guy. He knocked out a bear with just his fists.

Young Woman: No one will believe us…

[Saejima goes on and notices something on the ground.]

Saejima: (I see somethin'.)

[He picked up Impressive Map Scrap A.]

Man's Voice: So, you found it at last.

Saejima: Who're you?

Mysterious Man: Yikes, don't give me that look. I was just trying to create a little atmosphere. Er, let me introduce myself. I'm Tokuyama, head of the Tsukimino Merchants Association. What you picked up there is a key item in the treasure hunt event we're holding right now!

Saejima: Treasure hunt?

Tokuyama: That's right. There are 24 other pieces just like the one you have So that makes a total of 25 map pieces scattered around town. A single piece isn't much use. But as you collect the others, you can put them together to make treasure maps. There are five treasure maps in total. In other words, each is split into five pieces.

Saejima: Huh. So five treasure maps are scattered 'round town, split into 25 pieces?

Tokuyama: That's right! And what's more, the completed treasure maps take the form of riddles! We racked our brains and came up with the toughest riddles we could. Only those who solve them can claim the treasure. So, what do you say? Have I got you all fired up to go on a treasure hunting adventure?

Saejima: Guess I'll pick 'em up if I spot 'em.

Tokuyama: Oh, don't play coy with me! I know you're all revved up and ready to go, you old grump.

Saejima: ……

Tokuyama: Er, anyway. I hope you enjoy the event!

[Finally Saejima finds the bar Baba was talking about and enters it.]

Bartender: Welcome.

Saejima: How do I get into the casino?

Bartender: I don't know what you mean. This is a bar.

Saejima: Yeah, shoulda figured ya'd want a tip. How much?

Bartender: I really have no idea what you're talking about. There's no gambling here. If it's a drink you want, I can do that. We are a bar, you know.

Saejima: (He's not bitin'. What's up with this?)

Man: Say, there. If you have the time, how about a game of billiards?

Saejima: Sure.

Man: Heh, this should be good.

[After a fierce struggle, Saejima still loses.]

Man: Heh, that was entertaining.

Snappily Dressed Man: Evening.

Saejima: Uh-huh.

Snappily Dressed Man: Hey, do you shoot pool? I'm so tired of playing the regulars here. Can I challenge you to a match?

Saejima: Sorry, not now.

Snappily Dressed Man: Don't you want to know how to get into the casino?

Saejima: Who are ya?

Snappily Dressed Man: That's not important. But come on, how about it? If you win, I'll tell you how to get in. Or, if you're not much of a pool player… Well, I've already said too much. Why don't you forget we ever talked, and l let you settle my bar tab today. Fifty grand.

Saejima: Sorry, but I can't trust ya.

Snappily Dressed Man: Tch, it's not like you have any other leads, do you? Whatever. But if you change your mind, come on back here. I got nowhere else to be.

[After thinking for a while, Saejima goes back to the man.]

Snappily Dressed Man: Evening. Interested in the casino?

Saejima: Yeah, I'll take ya on.

Snappily Dressed Man: Very well. May the best man win.

[Saejima loses again!]

Snappily Dressed Man: Haha! I knew I'd win, hahaha.

Saejima: (What a blowhard.)

Snappily Dressed Man: Hah, don't take it too hard. I'm available for a rematch any time…

Saejima: Don't got time to play. Here, how's this?

[Saejima pays 50,000 yen.]

Snappily Dressed Man: Hm, disappointing. Well, I'll just drown my sorrows in alcohol, then.

Saejima: Tell me about the casino. You promised.

Snappily Dressed Man: Yeah, okay. So the club had to change its system after the police cracked down on it. Now you have to have a pass to get in.

Saejima: Okay. Where do I get one?

Snappily Dressed Man: That, I don't know. Kiyotaka might, though…

Saejima: Who's that?

Snappily Dressed Man: He's this homeless guy. He's really old.

Saejima: An old, homeless guy knows. Real classy place, this casino's gotta be. Have any idea where this guy is?

Snappily Dressed Man: Nah. But I mean, wouldn't he go somewhere he'd be sheltered? That's what I would do, heck…

Saejima: Ya mean somewhere with a roof? I doubt he'd be allowed to loiter in stores. (Come to think of it, there was that covered shoppin' area in Tsukimino. He'd be sheltered without havin' to go inside the stores there.) 'Kay, I'm gonna go find 'im.

Snappily Dressed Man: Good luck.

Get A Casino Pass
Saejima: (I need a pass for the casino, eh? Bet that old homeless guy Kiyotaka has one.)

[He prowls the city looking for the homeless man…]

Saejima: (There. Is that Kiyotaka?) Say, are you Kiyotaka?

Old Kiyotaka: Why do you wanna know? Whatre you accusing me of?

Saejima: Ain't accusin' ya of nothin'. I just want a pass to get into the hidden casino at Ambitious. It's a bar.

Old Kiyotaka: Well, you know, we homeless get accused of everything---that's if we're not just outright ignored! Do you even know how many of us were in Hokkaido in January 2012?

Saejima: Huh?

Old Kiyotaka: Consider this a pop quiz for the prize you seek. It's a real number---the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare counted us up. Quick, quick, how many?

Saejima: (How many homeless? Uh…)

[He names a random large number.]

Old Kiyotaka: That's correct! Wow, I didn't expect that. How did you know? Are you the most well-researched guy in town, or just a lucky guesser?

Saejima: So, 'bout that pass…

Old Kiyotaka: Okay, okay.

[Saejima got Phone Booth Photo.]

Saejima: What's this?

Old Kiyotaka: A photo of a certain spot in town. Keep an eye out for it. It will lead you to what you seek.

Saejima: Find the place in the photo. Got it.

[Coming out of the narrow alleyway to a wide road, Saejima meets a rather feisty kid who immediately rushes into a fight. Saejima defeats him.]

Saejima: Come on, that all ya got?

Aggressive Man: Dammit! Why can't I beat you?

Saejima: (That one didn't seem like an ordinary street punk.)

[A stylish man wearing sunglasses and a hat approaches Saejima.]

Tournament Staff: That was an impressive fight, Taiga Saejima-san.

Saejima: Who're you?

Tournament Staff: We've been watching you. It would seem you've been trying to avoid attention. That man you just defeated is in the qualifying round of the Victory Road tournament.

Saejima: Victory Road?

Tournament Staff: The Victory Road is an underground fighting contest with qualifiers held concurrently all over Japan. Its sole purpose is to find the ultimate fighter in all of Japan. As for me? I help run the tournament.

Saejima: What's this got to do with me?

Tournament Staff: Anyone as strong as you are has everything to do with our tournament. But be warned. From now on, other Victory Road contenders will be gunning for you. Defeat all the contenders here in town, and I'll see you at the finals. Can you become the Ultimate Fighter, Saejima-san?

Saejima: And if I got other things to do?

Tournament Staff: You'll come around. Your kind always does. Now, if you'll excuse me.

Saejima: (Sounds like another pain in the ass.)

[After some hard searching, Saejima finds the phone booth.]

Saejima: (This phone booth… It's the one in the photo.)

[Unexpectedly the phone starts ringing.]

Saejima: (Guess I'm s'posed to answer it.) Hello.

Voice on Phone: Go to the lottery kiosk. The passcode is "seven scattered losing tickets."

Phone: *click* *dial tone*

[Saejima finds a lottery booth.]

Lottery Clerk: Hello. How may I help you?

Saejima: (What'd the voice on the phone say? The first bit of the password was…)

One
Seven ✓
Nine

Saejima: (The next bit of the password was…)

Random
Consecutive
Scattered ✓

Saejima: (And then finally…)

Losing Tickets ✓

Saejima: Seven scattered losing tickets.

Lottery Clerk: Oh… I know what that means!

[Saejima got Underground Casino Pass.]

Lottery Clerk: May Lady Luck be with you!

Saejima: 'Preciate it. (Finally got the damn pass! Now back to Ambitious.)

Saejima: Hey, take a look at this pass I got here.

Manager: Hm, show the barkeep, please.

Saejima: *sigh*

Bartender: You again.

Saejima: Does this get me into the casino?

[Saejima presented the Underground Casino Pass.]

Bartender: Yup, you're good. Have a good time.

Manager: Please go on through.

[And then finally Saejima finds himself in a secret casino. He notices three yakuza smoking and talking to each other.]

Tall Kitakata Thug: Only two days left 'til the snow festival. Nothing quite like knockin' back a few drinks to keep warm in that bitin' cold.

Sunglass-wearing Kitakata Thug: I hear there are gonna be lots of people there this year, too.

Tall Kitakata Thug: That's good! With all the sponsors ditchin' over the past few years, I was afraid the festival was gonna flat out disappear or some shit.

Fierce-looking Kitakata Thug: They say the big crowds this year are all because of the old man

Tall Kitakata Thug: Patriarch Kitakata?

Fierce-looking Kitakata Thug: Yeah. Apparently he scared up sponsors all across Hokkaido, and didn't let up until the festival was fully funded.

Sunglass-wearing Kitakata Thug: Hell yeah. That's our guy.

Saejima: (Just need them to say where he is…)

Tall Kitakata Thug: The boss has got more connections than I can count. Shit, he's even had drinks with the mayor.

Sunglass-wearing Kitakata Thug: Really? The mayor of Sapporo?

Tall Kitakata Thug: Yeah. Trust me, I was there, man.

Tall Kitakata Thug: The mayor, he treated Kitakata with total respect. It was something to behold. Glad I’m in this family, let me tell ya!

Fierce-looking Kitakata Thug: Well, the mayor should have some respect. This festival wouldn't even be happening without the old man. Also explains why he's a guest of honor.

Tall Kitakata Thug: What?

Saejima: (Now there's some useful info.)

Fierce-looking Kitakata Thug: You didn't know? Kitakata's going to be in the festival's opening ceremony with all the other guests in front of the special stage. Heh, thank goodness it starts at noon. He hates getting up early.

Tall Kitakata Thug: Tch, he also hates stuffed-shirt events. Won't this be torture for him?

Fierce-looking Kitakata Thug: For some reason, he cheerfully accepted this particular invite.

Saejima: Yo!

Tall Kitakata Thug: Who're you!?

Saejima: Doesn't matter. Did ya say your boss is gonna be in the openin' ceremony?

Fierce-looking Kitakata Thug: What's it to you?

Sunglass-wearing Kitakata Thug: You better not be looking to cause trouble for our old man.

Saejima: Nothin' like that. I just want to talk to him about my sworn brother.

Sunglass-wearing Kitakata Thug: Hah! Like I'm gonna believe that.

Tall Kitakata Thug: Wait a second… is this about that Tojo officer? The dead guy?

Saejima: Ya know somethin' about Majima?

Sunglass-wearing Kitakata Thug: Hmph. You're obviously a Tojo assassin going after our old man.

Saejima: That ain't it!

Fierce-looking Kitakata Thug: It damn well better not be! There's nothing to know beyond what the news already reported. And now we gotta hold you until we're sure you're not a threat. Let's get him, boys!

[Saejima kicks their asses.]

Saejima: Sorry I had to do this, but I gotta know the facts about my sworn brother. (And only Kitakata himself knows those facts.)

Fierce-looking Kitakata Thug: Ugh, fuck you…

Saejima: (He doesn't know when to quit…)

Fierce-looking Kitakata Thug: Don't think this is over. We'll hunt you down. You can't escape the Kitakata in Tsukimino.

Saejima: (Great. Now they'll be tailin' me.)

[He comes out of the bar.]

Saejima: (Alright, got some intel on Kitakata. Now back to Polaris!)

[On his approach to Polaris, he encounters several police officers…]

Saejima: (Cops… Best steer clear.)

[Ge returns to Polaris.]

Baba: So did you learn anything useful?

Saejima: Yeah. Kitakata's gonna be a guest of honor at the snow festivaľ's opening ceremony. That's two days from now, at noon.

Baba: That makes sense. He's a local VIP in this town.

Saejima: Yeah. Which means we don't know when his path is gonna cross ours again… This ceremony is the only chance we'll get. Waitin' around for another opportunity will just get us nabbed by cops.

Baba: But how are we going to get Kitakata to talk to us? And won't he be center stage at the snow festival? That’s not exactly ideal.

Saejima: There'll be lotsa security, that's true.

Baba: Um, then maybe… What if we disguised ourselves as guests?

Saejima: With my build? Won't ever work.

Baba: Okay. We could… wait until the end of the ceremony, after he walks offstage, and approach him then?

Saejima: I’ll get collared long before that.

Baba: Well, then, uh…

Saejima: Hmmm…

Baba: Hmmm…

Saejima: That settles it. We’ll have to kidnap him.

Baba: What!?

Saejima: It's our only choice. We can do it during the ceremony if we choose a moment when there's hardly any guards around ‘im.

Baba: Wait! Just listen to what you're saying! There'll be tens, no, hundreds of thousands of people watching the ceremony on TV. There's no way we can pull off a kidnapping!

Saejima: It's still the only way. Every day we do nothin' is a day where I might get hauled back to prison. Can't have that.

Baba: But…

Saejima: No choice. We gotta make a move. Well nab him when no one's payin' attention.

Baba: And when would that be?

Saejima: Well, obviously we gotta plan it out.

Baba: The only thing harder than this would be if we just outright attacked their office! Oh come on… It's not like the boss is some spring chicken. How hard could it be to snatch ‘im? It just seems so impossible.

Saejima: Y’know, why is Kitakata so popular around town anyway?

Baba: Well, he's third generation. The family's ruled Tsukimino since before the war. He's got deep ties in the local community. Nobody has a reason to speak ill of him. In fact, when a gang from Tohoku tried to muscle their way in, the Kitakata protected the whole town.

Saejima: Huh. Sounds like a man after my own heart.

Baba: Which is why I can't believe he'd just kill Majima-san for no reason.

Saejima: Could be… if he's as responsible a man as he sounds… He mighta been resistin' something that woulda been bad for his family. There's a rumor that Majima tried to force Kitakata to kneel to the Tojo Clan.

Baba: Even if that rumors true, the boss I knew would have used reason before violence. I'm sure of it. He's not some psychopath.

Saejima: Well, we'll hear the truth when we meet the man. We gotta sneak into the festival ceremony somehow.

Baba: Then we should check out the site tomorrow, during the daytime.

Saejima: Yup.

Baba: Tomorrow's going to be hectic. We should get some sleep.

Yeah. ✓
Nah.

Saejima: You're right. Sleep it is.

Baba: Great!

The next day…

Baba: Good morning, Aniki.

Saejima: Hey. How're ya doin'?

Baba: Much better than yesterday. I'll be able to put in a proper day's work today!

Saejima: Okay. But we can't go out together—that’ll draw attention. We’ll do the scoutin' separately.

Baba: Good idea. Let's meet back here when we're both done casing the site.

Saejima: Sounds good to me.

Prepare For The Kidnapping
[Saejima comes out of the bar and goes to scout.]

Saejima: (Security's awful tight. Better check out the place today.)

[He walks out to the venue of the upcoming event. There is a large poster on the stage with the following inscription.]

雪まつり! 2012 (Snow Festival! 2012)
オープニングセレモニー (Opening Ceremony)

Saejima: (This has gotta be where they'll do the snow festivaľ's opening ceremony. So, how do we nab Kitakata tomorrow? A manhole. Where does it lead to? That's all the scoutin' I can do. Better meet up with Baba at Polaris and plan for tomorrow.)

Saejima: Hm? (Uh-oh. Cops. Gotta make myself scarce.)

[He runs away.]

Saejima: (Should be safe here. Gotta lay low till the cops are gone.)

Excited Young Man: Hey, who are you!?

Saejima: Huh?

[In a park where Saejima ran away, he finds three guys dressed in colorful jackets and caps.]

Excited Young Man: People are allowed to jump right in? No one told me.

Saejima: What's that? What’re ya talkin' about?

Flustered Man: Whoa, whoa, this is a big no-no. You're not supposed to be in here. If you want to participate, you have to register and wait for the next session.

Saejima: What’re ya sayin’?

Flustered Man: This is a fight arena for the snow festival.

Saejima: Eh? A fight arena sounds kinda intense for a snow festival.

Flustered Man: Let's get off the playing field and I'll explain.

[He and Saejima go to the sidewalk, where there are two tables and a large red banner is stretched.]

月見野 雪合戦 ○ (Tsukimino Snowball Fight)

Snowball Fight Coordinator: The arena is for snowball fights, hahaha. If you'd like to play, I can set you up. I handle all the registrations.

Saejima: Uh, that's okay. I ain't interested. It was just an accident, me wanderin' in.

Snowball Fight Coordinator: Oh. Well, if you change your mind, please come see me!

Saejima: Thanks. But for now, I gotta—Wait a minute. (Can't go back to the hideout with these cops everywhere. Better kill some time here.) Uh… Hey, how bout tellin' me the rules? So I can see if it's my style of competition.

Snowball Fight Coordinator: Sure! Here's how you play…

[He tells Saejima the rules.]

Snowball Fight Coordinator: That about covers it. If you ever need a refresher on the rules, I’ll be happy to explain again. Here's a snowball pouch. You need it to play. I’ll be right here anytime you want to participate. Just let me know.

Saejima: (Good, the cops are gone. Wouldn't mind a snowball fight if there's time, though.)

[He returns to Polaris.]

Baba: It took you a while to come back.

Saejima: I was doin' recon at the site. Security is everywhere. It's gonna be tough to even get close.

Baba: That's the least of our worries. Even if we manage to pull off this abduction, we're gonna have both the cops and the Kítakata chasing us. Our chances of success are… pretty damn slim.

Saejima: Yeah, tell me somethin' I don't know. We're still gonna try, and any problems that arise, we'll deal with 'em as they come. I gotta know the truth behind Majima's death. Whatever it takes, I gotta know.

Baba: …Okay.

Saejima: Sorry.

Baba: For what?

Saejima: For gettin' ya involved.

Baba: Aniki, you saved my life in prison, and on the mountain! It's my turn to do something for you. Please don't apologize for receiving what you're owed.

Saejima: All right. ‘Preciate it.

Baba: So… Did you find anything we can use for the actual kidnapping itself?

Saejima: That's the thing. I got no idea how we're gonna get close to Kitakata.

Baba: I see…

Saejima: Gotta figure out some way of gettin' close without bein' noticed.

Baba: You know, I… I just remembered something. I have to go out for a bit.

Saejima: What's this all of a sudden?

Baba: Nothing important. You should probably get some shut-eye while I'm gone.

[He leaves the bar.]

Saejima: (What's eatin' Baba-chan? Do I really wanna sleep like he suggested?)

Get Rest for Tomorrow ✓
Explore the Town

Saejima: It is gonna be a busy day tomorrow…

[The next day Baba returns.]

Baba: Good morning, Aniki.

Saejima: Hey. Didn't notice you were back.

Baba: (bows) Yeah, sorry I was late.

Saejima: Well, as to what we gotta do today.

Baba: Yeah, I think it's gonna be hairy. If you need to do anything first, better go do it right now.

Saejima: All right.

Baba: I’ll do the same. Let's meet back here by noon.

Saejima: Gotcha. (This could be the last day to roam free in Tsukimino. Better not leave with any regrets.)

Baba: Are you ready?

All done. ✓
Still getting ready.

Saejima: Yeah. All set.

Baba: Then we should be going.

Saejima: Sure. On the way, let's figure out how to get close to Kitakata.

Baba: Now that I think about it, security around the site is only going to get tighter. Aniki. We should travel separately so we can slip by them more easily.

Saejima: Good idea. Just don't do nothin' crazy on yer own, Baba-chan.

Baba: I won't. Well, I’ll be going, then.

[He leaves the bar.]

Saejima: (All right, I’ll have to get myself to the site soon…)

[Outside he finds a policeman talking to a man in sunglasses.]

Sapporo Police Officer: Sir, can I check your bag?

Saejima: (We ain't gettin' through the main streets, that's for sure. Got no choice. The alleys, it is.)

[He runs through the alleyway and stumbles upon… a gang of yakuza.]

Saejima: Eh!?

Kitakata Member: Just as expected. Haha, we knew that checkpoint would spook you and send you this way.

Saejima: You Kitakata?

Kitakata Member: You got it. Man, I can't believe you actually busted out of Abashiri… Respect, dude. All this talk of the legendary hitman might actually have some truth to it.

[Saejima is getting surrounded…]

Saejima: ……

Kitakata Member: But you're not getting past me. Sorry, but no vengeance for your wormy little pal Majima! The Kitakata Family will never kneel to the Tojo Clan!

Saejima: Hey, you got the time?

Kitakata Member: Huh?

Saejima: The time.

Kitakata Member: Eh? It's… it's a bit after 11:30.

Saejima: Then I ain't got time to dawdle. I’ll hafta finish this quick, then.

Kitakata Member: Hah! You think you're clever? When I'm through with you, you won't be clever enough to scratch your ass! Let's get him!

[Saejima quickly crashes the Kitakata Family's yakuza.]

Saejima: That takes care of that. They coulda set an ambush for Baba-chan, too. Better regroup soon.

[He leaves the alleys.]

Saejima: (Tch, there's a cop. Better cross the road and take the long way around. Huh? There's a cop on that side, too! Gotta hide! Wait… Huh?)

[He notices a Santa costume on a stand near one of the shops.]

Saejima: (Ain't nowhere to hide, so I need a disguise! This’ll work! Sorry, but I gotta borrow this!)

[He changes his clothes into Santa’s. He even got a short white beard!]

Saejima: (All right, looks like it worked. I’ll give this outfit back later. Gotta find Baba-chan now.)

Kitakata Family Member: Huh? Hey, it's that Saejima guy! You got some nerve coming here in that getup! I’m going to fuck you up real good!

[Saejima brutally makes his way through waves of Kitakata’s yakuza in Santa outfit. Finally he leaves the narrow streets.]

Saejima: Huh? (There's Baba-chan! Is he lookin' for me? Gotta cross the road and meet up.)

Baba: This way, Aniki! Are you all right, Aniki?

Saejima: Right as rain.

Baba: By the way, what's with the getup?

Saejima: This? Just camouflage to keep the cops off my tail.

Baba: You kind of stick out.

Saejima: Yeah? Better change, then. Hang on. This'll work, right? I’ll stash the other outfit for now.

Baba: No time to waste. Follow me!

[They run into the alley, where the Kitakata gang is already waiting for them.]

Baba: Damn it! They're waiting for us here, too!

Saejima: Only one way through. Let's do this, Baba-chan!

[They beat the shit out of the gang.]

Baba: There. That was the last of them!

Saejima: Seems so. Man, they didn't even hesitate to attack ya, huh? And you're from the same family as they are… 

Baba: Yeah, crazy… I didn't recognize any of them, though. They must have joined the family after I was gone. That was ten years ago.

Saejima: Yeah? Ya miss it?

Baba: Things… are different now, compared to when I left. There really is no place I can call home anymore.

Saejima: It's a sad thing.

Baba: We should go. Come on, this way.

Saejima: What’re we gonna do here?

Baba: We can travel through the sewers if we go down this manhole.

Saejima: And we wanna do that why?

Baba: At the ceremony site, there's a manhole right where the stage is located. If we start here, we can approach the stage without being detected. This is the best chance we've got at getting close to Kitakata.

Saejima: How'd you figure that out?

Baba: I used to play at that park when I was a kid. I remember every last detail of the place.

Saejima: How ‘bout that? Let's do it!

[They enter the sewers.]

Baba: It’s right up here.

Saejima: Ya got the time?

Baba: It's already past noon. The opening ceremony should've started by now.

Saejima: All right, here we are.

Baba: ……

Saejima: Somethin' the matter? You're not gettin' cold feet on me now, are ya?

Baba: No! It's just… I don't know what to say to the boss when I see him…

Saejima: Don't be worryin' about that now. Focus on how we're gonna pull off the kidnappin’.

Baba: …You're right, Aniki. I'm sorry.

Saejima: All right. Let's go.

[The ceremonies have already begun…]

Mayor: With all of your help, the 56th Tsukimino Snow Festival has kicked off without a hitch. Hokkaido's winters are harsher than even the fiercest of beasts. Our annual deluge of snow is an unavoidable fact of life here. Yet we welcome it as an old friend. Hold a festival to celebrate its coming. That speaks volumes to our tenacity. And the reverence with which we view nature.

[Kitakata, meanwhile, listens to the speech and picks his ear. A policeman approaches him.]

Policeman: Kitakata, sir. We've received word on the escaped convict. He's been sighted in the vicinity. Security is tight, but we can never be too careful. Please stay vigilant, sir.

[The mayor sits next to Kitakata.]

Mayor: Hm? Is there a problem?

Kitakata: Not at all. Just an appointment I'm looking to keep. Looks like I can finally honor my promise. But I have to wonder… Where's he gonna come from?

[DAIZO KITAKATA. Patriarch of The Kitakata Family.]

Kitakata: Oh, it's nothing. Just an old man's mumblings.

Mayor: Well, it's time for the opening air show.

[Jets perform aerobatics. The mayor watches them with fascination.]

Mayor: What do you think? Quite a display, isn't it? We really pushed the boat out this year.

[But Kitakata is already gone!]

Mayor: Huh?

[Saejima leads Kitakata through sewers holding him by his neck.]

Kitakata: The sewers, huh? Color me impressed.

Saejima: You're Kitakata, yeah? Head o' the Kitakata Family?

Kitakata: That's right Meaning you're Taiga Saejima.

Saejima: Yup.

Kitakata: Good finally meeting you. Been waiting a long time.

Saejima: Oh yeah? N' why's that? 

Kitakata: You heard all about Majima's death, didn't you? That's why you broke outta Abashiri. To meet the guy who bumped off your bro. Right?

[Saejima stays silent.]

Kitakata: About that. There's something I've gotta tell you.

Saejima: What's that?

Kitakata: The last thing Goro Majima ever said. Interested? Got a place nobody'll bother us. We can talk there.

Baba: Aniki. This might be a trap.

Kitakata: Don't fret. Not even my boys know about this spot of mine. Police, neither. Already said, we both want something outta this. Now c'mon. Before someone finds us.

Baba: Aniki…

Saejima: Fine then. I'll go with ya.

[Kitakata leads Saedjima and Baba to an empty apartment with no furniture in a high-rise building.]

Kitakata: I bought this building just the other day. Tsukimino's been hurting economically. Speculators come crying to me with properties they can't sell. Hmph. It's not like I'm rolling in dough either.

Saejima: Let's cut to the chase. What did ya wanna tell me? Somethin' to do with Majima's final words? 

Kitakata: Yeah. Something like that.

Saejima: ……

Baba: Um, I'm going to scout the area. Saejima-aniki and I can't just take your word that it's safe. (leaves)

Kitakata: Heh, that kid wasn't born yesterday. He another sworn brother of yours?

Saejima: …Thought you two might know each other, actually.

Kitakata: No, can't say we do. You know, you're not like how I thought you'd be. I was expecting more of a big, strong brute. But I should have figured… You're a sworn brother of Majima, and like him, you're soft on the inside.

Kitakata: First time I been called that.

Kitakata: Hmph. Our line of work has been taken over by those too blind to see the forest for the trees. All they care about is posturing. Pretending to be the tough guy. That's why they fail. …By the way. You don't seem all too angry for someone whose sworn brother was murdered.

Saejima: If he's dead, it means he was weak. Ain't no call for me to get involved just 'cause the weak fell to the strong.

Kitakata: I see…

Saejima: But I do wanna know… Why did Majima hafta be killed? And what were his dyin' words? That much, I gotta hear. So when are ya gonna quit stallin' and tell me?

Kitakata: Well… I've been turning it all over in my mind… How to tell you what happened that day. How to tell you the truth.

Saejima: What truth? Let’s hear it.

Kitakata: …The Kitakata Family didn't kill Majima. We never had any reason to…

Saejima: Whaddya mean?

Kitakata: I mean exactly what I say. Nothing more, nothing less.

Saejima: I know Majima tried to make ya accept an allegiance pact with the Tojo Clan. That's more than enough reason to snuff him out. Don't try to tell me ya had no motivation.

Kitakata: Ah, but that's where you're mistaken. Majima never demanded that we become a subsidiary of the Tojo.

Saejima: What?

Kitakata: He came with his head bowed, asking me to accept an equal alliance. In other words, he asked me to become Daigo Dojima's sworn brother.

Saejima: Kitakata and Tojo… Equal partners?

Kitakata: Oh yes. And not just us. Apparently, the same deal was being offered in Fukuoka and Nagoya.

Saejima: (What's goin' on?)

Kitakata: I did not, and still don't, have any objections to an equal partnership. With Tojo as a partner, people will think twice before trying to mess with us.

Saejima: So you were gonna accept the pact?

Kitakata: I was. So you can see, I had no reason to kill Majima.

Saejima: Then who did?

Kitakata: That's… the most important truth I have to tell you. After the first meeting, I ruminated on the excellent offer, made my decision, and arranged for a second talk with Majima. That's when things went sideways. I told Majima I would take the offer, but then he just sat there in complete silence.

Saejima: Hm?

Kitakata: Yeah. And when he finally did open his mouth, I couldn't believe what he said.

Saejima: What was it?

Kitakata: He said in a very serious tone… that I shouldn't accept the alliance.

Saejima: What!? That doesn't make any sense!

Kitakata: Majima knew something was up. That behind this oath swearing nonsense, someone was working toward something bigger.

Saejima: Somethin' bigger?

Kitakata: You heard me. If the Tojo swore an oath with the Kitakata Family… They'd be playing right into this guy's hands. So said Majima, at least.

Saejima: N' that's why he was tryin' to stop the alliance? To prevent that?

Kitakata: Presumably.

Saejima: Then lemme ask. Do ya know who's orchestratin' all this?

Kitakata: Well…

[And then he gets shot through the window! The sniper, who was standing on the neighboring, lower building, runs away. Saejima only has time to notice that he is wearing a dark-colored, possibly black winter jacket and dark jeans. The outfit seems to be vaguely familiar to him…]

Saejima: Kitakata! Hey, hang in there! Shit!

[He runs out into the street and spots the killer. Saejima runs after him and catches him up!]

Saejima: It's you… Baba! Baba-chan… The hell's goin' on!? Why'd ya shoot Kitakata? Why put a bullet in your own boss?

[Baba tears off her jacket. His attitude changes instantly. From a timid boy he becomes calculating and defiant.]

Baba: (laughs) Aniki. You know… You're even more naive than I thought. Kitakata's not my boss. Never was. I haven't spent a single day in the Kitakata Family. But I needed you to believe I did. Needed to pretend. All to achieve my goal.

Saejima: Whaddya mean?

Baba: Well, you see. My prison transfer, my placement into your cell… It was all part of the plan.

Saejima: Everythin' was just some kinda act, then?

Baba: That's right. Thankfully, you behaved exactly as we hoped you would. So much that it threw me off. But, to be honest… I never wanted you to find out about this.

Saejima: Baba-chan.

Baba: (smirks) If I knew it would come to this, well… I'd have just let myself die on that mountain. At least then I wouldn't have to feel this pain.

Saejima: What're ya drivelin' about?

Baba: They asked me to keep an eye on you. That's why I put myself behind bars. 

Saejima: Meanin' that whole spiel about ya gettin' a decade for murder…

Baba: A fabrication, of course. I knew a sob story like that would catch your attention, Saejima-san.

Saejima: Why do all that just to spy on me? Were ya tryin' to keep me from breakin' out?

Baba: No, not at all. The opposite, in fact.

Saejima: What?

Baba: I had one job: to control the length of your sentence. Figure out the right timing, help you find your way to freedom… And finally, bring you here to Tsukimino.

Saejima: Quit takin' me for a ride. No chance ya coulda done that.

Baba: Think back for a second. You would have been out on parole no problem if someone hadn't interfered. But who woulda done that?

Saejima: Ya can't mean…

Baba: Kugihara. He was a tool meant to extend your prison stay until the proper time. Oh… And he was working for me. I needed a way to delay your release. So I used Kugihara, and goaded you into delaying it yourself.

Saejima: Then wait. The stabbin' ya got accused of…

Baba: All fake. I mean, I did stab him. I had to make you lash out at Kugihara, somehow, and that was my only option.

Saejima: Baba…

Baba: But after all that, it was finally time to bust you out. A waste of effort, but it needed to be done. So, we pulled the necessary strings. Made you want to break out.

Saejima: What're ya gettin' at? Explain!

Baba: The death of Goro Majima. That was our sign. It was time for us to set you free, and you obliged. Only one thing could spur you on. That's why we needed to kill Majima. With him gone, you had to take action. Every bit of it a part of our plan.

Saejima: My bro died… 'cause of me? The hell's it all mean?

Baba: It wasn't just that. The warden's death, getting the Ministry of Justice to deny your parole… Everything fit together to give you the willpower to escape. Necessary evils. Of course, it wasn't through my power that all that happened.

Saejima: But why? What was so important about gettin' me back on the outside?

Baba: Well… You're part of my boss's plan. The most vital part.

Saejima: Your boss, huh? Who's that?

Baba: You would have to die if you knew that. Of course, so would I if I told you. So, there's only one solution. 

[He pulls out a 9mm gun.]

Baba: To be honest, killing you was never part of our plan. But here we are. I have no choice.

Saejima: Only one of us gets to walk outta this place alive, huh? What're ya waitin' for? Do it. Just pull the damn trigger! Quit hesitatin', Baba-chan! I'm right here!

[Baba slowly lowers the gun, and… returns to his old self.]

Baba: Just… Just tell me something. I don't understand. Why'd you come back for me?

Saejima: What?

Baba: When I was lost in that blizzard! You should have abandoned me. Should have gone to Tsukimino alone! But you didn't. You put your life at risk, just to save me. (screams) Why!?

Baba: I couldn't leave my brother behind. That's all.

Baba: Brother?

Saejima: That's what ya are.

Baba: But… we never swore an oath. I only called you aniki because I looked up to you! Yet here you are saying I'm your brother!?

Saejima: 'Course. Swearin' the oath ain't much more than a dusty ol’ ritual. The bond we got… It's there even if we didn't make it official. Ya got that? Baba-chan. In my eyes, we been bros since before we even broke out.

[Baba aims his gun at Saejima again.]

Baba: (crying) Stop…!

Saejima: I don't care what your boss is after. You're my bro whether ya like it or not!

Baba: (screams) Stop calling me that!

[He slowly puts the gun to his head.]

Saejima: The hell do ya think you're doin'!?

[He punches Baba so hard he falls on the asphalt.]

Saejima: Get up, Baba-chan. As your aniki, there's a lesson I gotta teach ya.

Baba: What is it?

Saejima: No matter how hard life gets, ya gotta keep livin'. Keep on strugglin' for your dream!

Baba: What…?

Saejima: Ya heard me. Even you gotta have one. Somethin' ya want worse than anythin' in the world. I vowed before I shipped off to Abashiri. That people who didn't have no choice but to go yakuza… They wouldn't have to walk the same lonely road I did. That's what Majima n' I were fightin' for. N' why I'm standin' here now. Baba-chan. Dyin' ain't gonna magically, answer all your problems. Guess I'm gonna have to teach ya how heavy death really is.

Baba: What are you going to do?

Saejima: Simple. I'm gonna beat the fear o' death straight into your soul.

Baba: No surprise there. That's just what I thought you'd say.

Saejima: What, got a problem?

[They raise their fists.]

Baba: It's time to settle this. Once and for all.

Saejima: (screams) Get ready, Baba!

[Saejima fights his treacherous nakama Shigeki Baba and wins. The last punch gets Baba back on the asphalt. Saejima holds out her hand to him.]

Saejima: Well? How'd your first bite o' death taste?

Baba: Not the greatest.

[They sit on the asphalt. Saejima offers Baba a cigarette and lights for him and for himself.]

Baba: You're not going to ask? About who dragged you into all this. About my boss.

Saejima: Don't give a damn. Knowin' the truth… ain't gonna bring Majima back. 'Sides, I got this feelin' when I met Kitakata.

Baba: A feeling? What is it?

Saejima: My bro's still alive. Or maybe I'm just clingin' to the hope that he is.

Baba: Saejima-aniki. I'm in no position to ask this… But please, let me go for now.

[He bows deeply.]

Baba: If I let the truth slip here, I'm as good as dead. But… I'm not ready to die. Not till I achieve my dream.

Saejima: Good.

Baba: And once I reach the end of that path… I'll be back. We'll see each other again, Saejima-aniki. I promise. Maybe then, we can finally swear the oath for real.

Saejima: Yeah. Whenever you're ready. I'll be waitin'.

Baba: Right.

[He bows and runs away. Saejima picks up the gun from the asphalt. At that moment the door opens and a policeman in a trench coat speaks to him. Standing next to him are several men in suits, probably from the special department.]

Policeman: Not so fast. Taiga Saejima. You're under arrest for aggravated escape and unlawful possession of a firearm. ‘Bout time, too. Been wanting to talk to you for a while.

[Saejima is handcuffed and placed in a police van that drives someplace.]

Policeman: For the lengths you went through to break out, you came along without even a whimper. You play nice with Kitakata?

Saejima: How do ya know about that?

Policeman: We've been followin' your every move, every objective. That's how cops work. That, and we just brought your buddy Kitakata over to the police hospital.

Saejima: (stands up) Kitakata!? He's alive!?

Policeman: Yup. We rushed in when we heard the shot. Don't worry, we know you didn't do it. Hospital phoned us up not too long ago. He's gonna pull through. You can quit frettin'.

Saejima: That's great.

Policeman: Speakin' of Kitakata… You went to him for the truth about Majima's death, right?

[Saejima stay silent.]

Policeman: Tired of talkin'? Fine by me. Gives me a chance to run my mouth a bit. Not a soul gonna disturb us here. I'm sure Kitakata told you this, but… He and his boys didn't kill Majima. It was the Tojo Clan. Don't believe me, huh? Try this on for size, then. Daigo Dojima disappeared, down in Fukuoka seekin' out an alliance with the Yamagasa Family.

Saejima: What?

Policeman: Thought that'd interest you. But it's true. Dojima vanished without so much as a trace just the other day. Practically the same instant, Majima dies in Tsukimino and Azumi kicks the bucket in Nagoya. Safe to say the Tojo's a little panicked. Same goes for the PD. Hear they haven't slept a wink since all this went down. As for me, I'm hot on the trail of a guy by the name Morinaga.

Saejima: Morinaga?

Policeman: One of Daigo Dojima's personal bodyguards. Turns out, he offed the chief of HQ Aoyama down in Fukuoka.

Saejima: Aoyama's dead!?

Policeman: First Morinaga's boss Dojima goes missing. Then Morinaga puts a bullet in the new acting chairman's head. Don't that strike you as odd? And that guy you were with. Baba, was it?

Saejima: How do ya know about that?

Policeman: We've been trackin' him. Good to see it's already paying off.

Saejima: What're ya really after here? Thought ya just wanted to haul me back in.

Policeman: Well, we do. But not just that. My real goal in all this, well… It's finding out who's pulling the strings. The wolf among the Tojo Clan sheep.

Saejima: Ya mean there's a traitor? In the Tojo?

Policeman: Daigo Dojima's disappearance, Majima's death. And this business with you. All signs that the Tojo mountain that's dominated our skyline for decades… Might finally be startin' to crumble. Think about it. The timing was too perfect to be a coincidence. You ask me, that Baba guy you were with… He's working directly for whoever's trying to bring the Tojo crashing down.

Saejima: And this traitor. Ya think it's Morinaga?

Policeman: Chances are high.

Saejima: The hell's goin' on?

Policeman: One thing is for certain. There's a damn hellstorm brewin' around the Tojo Clan… And you're right in the center. An essential piece in this upheaval puzzle. You wanna help the Tojo Clan, don't you? 'Course you do, big guy. Can't do much if you're not in Tokyo, though.

Saejima: Ya don't gotta tell me that. Ain't a one thing I can do now.

Policeman: Oh yeah. Forgot to mention. This bus is on its way to the airport.

Saejima: What?

Policeman: This case is massive. A nationwide yakuza conspiracy of the absolute highest order. And the Osaka PD's gonna crack it wide open. To do that, we gotta go after the key players. Morinaga and Baba. And we want your help. Go to Tokyo. Figure out what's eating away at the corpse of your clan. Think you're up for it?

Saejima: Don't fuck with me.

Policeman: The Tojo Clan's on its last legs. And you were next in line to be captain. Shit'll go down if you show.

Saejima: So what, ya want me to be your police rat?

Policeman: If the answer's no, we'll gladly drive you straight on back to your jail cell. Well? You in?

[Saejima stays silent.]

PART 3 Prologue
[Kiryu is sitting on the floor of the dining room of his orphanage. He is dressed in a red Hawaiian shirt, hinting to us that the events take place in the times of Yakuza 3. Opposite him sits a woman in a strict business suit and black short-cropped hair.]

Woman: Have you ever thought of leaving this place, Kazuma Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: I'm not sure what you're getting at.

A year and a half earlier
Morning Glory Orphanage, Okinawa

Woman: It's been a week now since I met your daughter in that Ryukyu bookstore. Since then, I've spent my time researching both her and this orphanage. Quite thoroughly. Of course, I'm aware of your history. Haruka Sawamura. Her appearance and sense of style are unpolished, yes, but she shows undeniable potential. She just needs her edges smoothed. With time, I'm confident I can make her the most dazzling jewel anyone's ever seen. Entrust her to me, and she'll be a star.

Kiryu: On one condition, right? You want me out of the picture.

Woman: When people fall in love with someone, they naturally want to know every last detail. Their blood type, birthplace, fashion preferences, family… The more they learn, the more connected they feel. On the contrary, if that person seems unattainable… It only further fuels the thirst for knowledge. They want to know everything. Bring even the slightest little secrets out into the sun.

Kiryu: You mean Haruka's past.

Woman: Yes. Love can be a cruel thing. Once someone feels betrayed by the object of their affection, love can soon turn to hatred. Wouldn't you agree?

[Haruka in a Japanese schoolgirl costume overhears the conversation.]

Woman: It's for her own good. If we erase your connection to Haruka, I'll be able to protect her. In short…

[Kiryu stands up.]

Kiryu: Got it. I've heard enough.

Woman: And your answer?

Kiryu: I'm not leaving. Not a chance. My kids still need me. They'd be heartbroken if I walked out on them. As long as they're living here, I'm not going anywhere.

[Haruka smiles when she hears Kiryu's answer.]

Woman: So this is a matter of duty.

Kiryu: It's a lot deeper than that. This is the path I've chosen in life.

[The woman looks at him with displeasure.]

Kiryu: Now if you'll excuse me, I have things to do. You can see yourself out.

Woman: I must say, I'm surprised. For someone who's led the life you have, you know nothing about how the world works. You can't even make one little girl's wishes come true. You realize that, yes? And it's not just her. I noticed something during my visit the other day. This is where dreams come to die. As long as you're here, that is.

Kiryu: What's that supposed to mean?

Woman: I asked your children if they were happy… And they all gave me the same response. It was yes, of course. For a child with no family, this place must feel like heaven on earth. But the truth is, they're all afraid.

Kiryu: Afraid of what?

Woman: That one day this fragile happiness will shatter. Your children clearly love you, from the bottom of their hearts. At the same time, they also love the happy, peaceful life you provide for them. So much that they'd sacrifice anything just to hang on to it. Even their own aspirations. Kids should be free to be a little selfish. Free to chase their dreams. Free to be true to themselves. As long as you're here, your children will never have that freedom.

Kiryu: Excuse me?

Woman: You know it deep down. If your children are ever going to grow up, they need an ambition to strive for. Say one person clings to the safety of their current circumstance, while another doggedly pursues their goal. Who will be stronger in the end? Let Haruka-chan embark on this journey. You have one of your own to make. Not for others, but for yourself. Pursue your own goal.

Kiryu: But…

Woman: Leave your daughter to me. In return, I'll fund the future of every child who calls this place home. I'll cover their living expenses. Make sure they can grow and thrive. They won't have a want in the world. I'll even let you choose your own replacement. And I promise you. Haruka-chan will be a star. Just grant her this wish. Let her be the singer she wants to be.

Haruka: My… wish?

Kiryu: What makes you so sure? How could you possibly know what Haruka really wants? Why you, of all people?

Woman: It's simple. Because I wanted the same thing.

Kiryu: You had… the same dream?

Woman: Yes. As long as you find the right successor… Someone else can pick up the torch. Carry out your dream.

[Kiryu sinks into thought. Haruka, too, stands contemplating.]

PART 3 FIRST HALF - HARUKA SAWAMURA
Chapter 1: BACKSTAGE DREAMS
Sotenbori, Osaka

[Panorama of the city at night. People are pacing back and forth in the streets, preoccupied with their own business. In one of the buildings with a training room, a man with a ponytail (and it turns out to be not Majima) is clapping his hands in time while Haruka is practicing various dancing moves at the handrail. The woman we saw earlier, in a tight suit, is standing off to the side of the wall. The music stops. Tired Haruka bends down to catch her breath. Her coach approaches her.]

Coach: Wrong, wrong, wrong! How many lectures is this gonna take!? Ya gotta stick to the rhythm! Take it from the top!

Haruka: Yes, sir!

[The music comes back on and Haruka selflessly continues her dance training.]

Coach: Wrong again. Ya just ain't gettin' it. (loudly) Not good enough!

[Haruka falls on the floor.]

Coach: Haruka. If that drive's all ya got, you're better off never steppin' foot on a stage. How 'bout ya just call it quits?

Haruka: I can do this. Please, let me try again!

[Haruka continues to dance. She's tired, but she's not going to give up. The woman walks out of the training room without a word. We learn that Haruka's coach's name is Ogita.]

Ogita: Okay, once more from the top. This is basic stuff here, you know. If you can't do this, then I'm just wasting my time. Now, focus!

Haruka: Yes, sir!

[Haruka trains her dance moves Dance Dance Revolution style and scores 100%.]

Ogita: Hey, see what happens when you try? I’ll right. You can have a five minute break, then it's back to work.

Haruka: Right. Thank you.

[We're jumping into the marketing department. A man with glasses and a short haircut is talking on the phone.]

Man With Glasses: Yes, that's right. She's on Soten TV now. Haruka Sawamura. She's with us. Oh, yes! Naturally. Sawamura is our brightest star. Yeah, exactly! If she wins the Princess League, she's guaranteed her major debut! Seriously? You really meant that? That would be wonderful! Yes, absolutely. I see. That'd be great! Thanks for calling. Bye, now!

[Ogita enters the room and walks up to the woman in a strict suit who is sitting in the lounge and smoking.]

Orita: Hey, Horie-chan. Cup o' water, will ya?

[The man with glasses who had just been on the phone gets up from his seat. He notices that Ogita is sitting right in front of the cooler, but he still slavishly agrees.]

Horie: …Yes, of course.

Ogita: With all respect, ma'am. Ya seriously expect me to get her ready for the Princess League with just a week left? Ain't a chance! We'd need months. (drinks the water)

Woman: It's a little late for complaints. If you're really a pro, you'll have her ready by the time it starts.

Ogita: The deal was that we'd get her shinin' over the course of a year. Now you're sayin’ it's six months? That just ain't reasonable! Her singin' needs work. Her dancin' needs work. We gotta zero in on one thing at a time if she's gonna make the grade.

Woman: Haruka's far too special to settle for simply “making the grade.”

Ogita: She's a real diamond in the rough, yeah. Got the moves, the instinct, the looks. Boatload o' grit, too. Outta all the girls ya brought 'round the past six months… She's the only one who's toughed it out n' stuck around.

Woman: Then what's the problem?

Ogita: I'm sayin', because she's so special, we really oughta give her time to blossom. 

Woman: You've said enough, Ogita. Now shut your mouth and do as you're told. I'm paying you well enough for at least that.

Horie: But, ma'am, he's clearly only saying this out of concern for Haruka's well-being…

[The woman glances at Horie and he bows and retreats.]

Woman: (to Ogita) You and I signed a contract. If you can't meet the terms, I'd be glad to terminate it. Of course, since you aren't fulfilling your end of the deal… There would be consequences.

[Ogita clenches his hand slowly into a fist.]

Woman: What do you say?

Ogita: (stands up) Whatever, I'll do it. Ya happy now?

[He leaves the room. The woman glances at the TV, where Haruka is being interviewed. Ogita returns to the training room.]

Ogita: Listen, Haruka. I'm sure I don't have to tell ya, but you gotta keep going till you know this like the back of your hand. The lesson's not done until you master my moves right through to the end of the song. Got it?

Haruka: Yes, sir!

Ogita: Ready to start your lesson now?

Haruka: (bows) Yes, please!

Ogita: Good, Here we go.

[Haruka trains her dance moves for some time.]

Ogita: Hmm. That wasn't half bad. You're really comin' along. All right. That's enough for today. But it's gonna be another hard day tomorrow, so don't think about stayin’ out late or anythin' like that. You gotta get plenty of rest.

Haruka: I will. Thank you!

[He comes out of the training room and the woman in a suit enters. We finally find out her name - Park.]

Park: Good work.

Haruka: Park-san…

Park: The Princess League finals start tomorrow.

Haruka: Yes, ma'am.

Park: If you win, we'll be putting a major marketing push behind you. In preparation for that, I’ve arranged the ultimate opportunity.

Haruka: Ultimate?

Park: Four days after the final round of the Princess League finals… You'll make your debut at a live concert in Tokyo.

Haruka: A concert in Tokyo!?

Park: That's right. It’ll be your time to shine. You'll be the talk of the town, and the buzz will only build from there. Going to Tokyo will be proof that you've made it to the big leagues. Do you understand?

Haruka: Yes.

Park: In other words, there's no room for failure.

Haruka: Right…

Park: Hm? Why the long face? That's not like you.

Haruka: Haruka It's just that… it's a lot to take in all at once.

Park: Don't be silly. This is only the beginning. It's going to be a whirlwind from here on, the likes of which you never even imagined. Hundreds of thousands of people across the country will be listening to your songs. Millions of people will take notice of you. What others call unreal will be just another day in the life to you. You need to be ready.

Haruka: But we still don't know if I’ll win or not…

Park: True, but I believe you won't lose. If you lose, I’ll stop supporting the orphanage in Okinawa. I imagine it will have to shut down, and you won't have a home to return to… You understand, don't you, Haruka?

Haruka: I do. No matter what happens, I’ll never give up!

Park: Good. Well, you must be tired… I just thought I’d give you a little pep talk. Oh, and one thing you should remember… 

Haruka: Hm?

Park: The goal of a pop idol is to be loved by as many people as possible. Right?

Haruka: Yes…

Park: And the people who love you, your fans, will express their love in a wide variety of words and ways. You have to learn how to accept them—all of them.

Haruka: Right…

Park: I doubt there're many women out there who mind being told that they're loved or beautiful… Whenever a person first becomes famous, they're usually thrilled by all of the attention and adoration. But then one day they realize that the love from their fans isn't real love.

Haruka: What?

Park: Love from fans is a one-sided thing. Though we call it “love,” it's really something quite different. And when this reality hits, most idols tend to crash and burn.

Haruka: ……

Park: You would think that they could come to terms with it, and just keep moving forward… But, the truth is, they just can't.

Haruka: Why not?

Park: Because these girls believe that to be loved is simply their right, a fact of life. They've had their parents at their side, gone to school—a completely normal upbringing. They take the love of their friends and family for granted. The love these girls come to expect from being raised in said normal environment has made them weak.

Haruka: ……

Park: They can't tell the difference between one-sided love and real love. So once they realize the love from fans isn't real, they're devastated. They feel like all love is lost to them forever. People who take love for granted aren't able to properly distinguish its different forms.

Haruka: It’s different forms…

Park: Now, you've chosen to walk this road, and I understand you may feel a little daunted right now. But there's one thing about you I know for certain. You're a girl who already knows very well what it means to be loved.

Haruka: ……

[Park grabs Haruka by the shoulders.]

Park: You will be just fine. You can do this. Have confidence in yourself.

Haruka: Park-san…

Park: Hm?

Haruka: …Were you raised in an environment similar to mine?

Park: Well, aren't you the perceptive one? Yes, I, too, was raised without the love of my biological parents. I was severely abused by them before I could even walk or talk.

Haruka: Oh…

Park: For a long time, I lived without being loved by anyone… It was then I saw pop idols on TV. How attractive it all was. These girls were loved by so many people, something I could never relate to. I was dazzled by them. So, as a child, I made the decision to become an idol myself. Of course, I never managed to make it big.

Haruka: ……

[Park lowers her hands.]

Park: Tomorrow begins with a fan club sponsored event. Then in the afternoon, it's round one of the Princess League finals on Soten TV. Come to the office at nine tomorrow morning. Oh, and by the way, I’m assigning Horie to be your manager, starting tomorrow. Now go home and get some rest.

Haruka: (bows) Yes, ma'am… Have a good night.

Park: You, too.

Haruka: Park-san… I'm going to give this everything I have.

Park: Of course you are. I know that.

[Haruka comes out of the training room and changes clothes.]

Haruka: (Okay. I'm done changing. I'll just say goodbye to Horie-san before going home.)

[E-mail]
My international friends
best_friend@…
Hello, my friends all over the world! I have a request for you today. Lately I haven't been able to take any of the perfect shots that I long for! So I had an idea! I want all of you to upload any perfect shots you take to the image hosting site /the video does not show the full text of the letter/ 

Haruka: (What could this email be about? Was it sent to me by mistake? It does sound interesting, though. Maybe I'll take a look if I find time.)

[She finds Horie. He stands near the stairs.]

Horie: Hello, Haruka-chan. All done for the day? Park-san asked me to see ya home safe. Just lemme know when you're ready. Unless you're ready to go now, that is?

Ready ✓
Not Quite Yet

Haruka: Okay, I'm ready.

Horie: All right. Off we go, then.

[They walk out to the street.]

Horie: All righty, shall we head out?

Haruka: Okay.

[They walk down the street.]

Horie: You're really giving it your all every day, aren't you?

Haruka: This is all so new to me, I have to work even harder if I want to catch up.

Horie: But you've only been taking lessons—or been in this industry at all—for about six months, right? And you still managed to win your way to the finals of the Princess League. That's pretty amazin, if you ask me! Park-san really knew what she was doing when she signed you. You've got real talent.

Haruka: I still have a long way to go, though. Just today alone, I got yelled at so many times! But that's very nice of you to say. Thank you, Horie-san.

Horie: You're very welcome. Hey, there's that smile I love to see! By the way, how's school going? Gettin' used to things?

Haruka: Hmm… I’m not sure.

Horie: Not going well?

Haruka: Well, I'm managing to keep up with my studies. It's just… I don't have many friends yet.

Horie: I see. Yeah, as busy as you are, I don't imagine you have a whole lot of time to just go hang out, huh?

Haruka: Exactly. And, well, some of the kids have things to say about the kind of work I do…

Horie: Never mind what kids like that say! They'te just jealous!

Haruka: I try not to let it bother me, but… maybe it is kind of weird. What I do, I mean.

Horie: I think what you and I do gives the audience a chance to dream. And speaking as a pop idol fan myself, your performances are really something special. I say you should have confidence in yourself! Hold your head high and proudly proclaim that you're a pop idol! But truth be told, I get yelled at even more than you do, so I'm probably not very convincin'.

Haruka: That's not…

Horie: Haruka-chan, I'm still pretty green at this manager thing, but I'm gonna do everything in my power to support you. If you ever need anythin' at all, you just let me know!

Haruka: …Thank you. That's very nice of you, Horie-san.

Horie: I really mean it. Oh, look. We're here. 

[They stop at a closed building with a sign.]

Horie: The Princess League finals start tomorrow! And you've got work in the morning too, so be sure to get plenty of rest.

Haruka: I will.

Horie: Great work today. Good night!

Haruka: (bows) Good night.

[Horie leaves. Haruka walks into her small rented apartment of two rooms, a bedroom and a kitchen.]

Haruka: (Maybe I should get some sleep.)

Go to Bed ✓
Not Yet

Haruka: (I’ll need to get plenty of sleep for tomorrow.)

The next day

[Haruka looks at a picture of the children from Morning Glory.]

Haruka: I promise I'll work really hard today!

[She leaves the apartment.]

Head For Dyna Chair
[Descending the stairs to the street, Haruka encounters a girl.]

Akari: Huh? Aren't you Sawamura-san?

Haruka: Oh! Yes, um…

Akari: Akari. Akari Natsukawa. I'm in the class next to yours at school. Don't you remember me?

Haruka: Oh, we're in the same home ec class… I’m sorry. I don't know many people at school yet. I’m having a hard enough time just remembering the kids in my own class.

Akari: I know how you feel. We both transferred in for high school, and they've all been together since middle school. And we're not from Kansai, either, so it's hard to get into their rhythm.

Haruka: Oh, you're not from Kansai, either?

Akari: Nah. I'm from Tokyo. We just moved to Osaka this year because of my father's job.

Haruka: Oh, I see.

Akari: I’ve been noticing you at school. You look like you're having a hard time fitting in, and you're usually by yourself.

Haruka: It's my own fault, though. I can't seem to work up the courage to talk to my classmates much.

Akari: It's not your fault. I mean, Kansai kids talk really fast. It makes chiming in kinda hard, ya know? And I'm sure everybody in your class is shy around you. You know, holding back a little.

Haruka: Why's that?

Akari: Well, you are in the entertainment business! You have this special aura about you. I think that makes it hard for the other kids to approach you.

Haruka: But I'm really just a regular girl!

Akari: I’m from Tokyo, so you and I have the same slower pace. It's easy for us to talk.

Haruka: I think so, too, Natsukawa-san.

Akari: Just call me Akari. Can I call you Haruka, Sawamura-san?

Haruka: Sure!

Akari: Here's to the two latecomers, then! You must be tired, going to school and working all the time. If you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.

Haruka: Okay. Thanks.

Akari: Uh-oh! I'm supposed to be at dance practice right now!

Haruka: Oh, you're studying dance?

Akari: Well, nothing all that formal. What I do is more like street dancing… I find people dancing around town and practice with them.

Haruka: Wow! You must be pretty assertive, Akari-chan.

Akari: (bows) Well, I can't take lessons like you do, so I have to do what I can on my own, right?

Haruka: You really love to dance, don't you?

Akari: I do! I want to be a choreographer someday. I want to teach pop idols like you super-cool moves and dance along with them. Wouldn't that be great?

Haruka: Yeah!

Akari: That's why I'm putting so much effort into my own dancing now. And Sotenbori's a major hotspot for dance, so it's perfect.

Haruka: It is? I didn't know that.

Akari: Mhm. I heard Osaka is where break dancing was first introduced into Japan. Akari Mhm. I heard Osaka is where break dancing was first introduced into Japan. People come here from all over the country in the hopes of making it as a dancer. Didn't you know that?

Haruka: I didn't. But I did notice there were a lot of people dancing on the street.

Haruka: I didn't. But I did notice there were a lot of people dancing on the street.

Haruka: Dance battles?

Akari: Yeah. Two people dance to the same music and compete for the best performance. It’s a lot more interesting than taking lessons at a dance studio, and harder too, I bet!

Haruka: You're probably right.

Akari: Hey, I know! Why don't you try one out? You could go up against me!

Haruka: What!? Me?

Akari: Sure! Why not? You'd love street dancing! It's loads of fun! And it'd be great practice, too!

Haruka: But…

Akari: Oh, come on! Give it a try! Wouldn't it be nice to do something fun with a friend for a change?

Haruka: …Yeah. Okay, I’ll do it! I've never done it before, though, so I might make lots of mistakes…

Akari: Don't worry about that! I'll be there to help you through it! Come on!

[They have a nice and fun dance battle. Haruka wins!]

Akari: Phew! Well, I lost. You're really good, Haruka. Silly of me to go up against a pro!

Haruka: *pant* *pant* Don't sell yourself short… You had all kinds of moves I’d never even seen before!

Akari: That's the great thing about dance battles. Win or lose, you get to see new dance moves up close. That was a great workout! So what did you think of your very first battle?

Haruka: It was tiring, but it was a lot of fun!

Akari: I'm glad you liked it!

Haruka: I realized something today, dancing with you. I've had so many dance lessons lately, I was starting to think of dancing as work. But dancing is more than that. It's supposed to be fun, right?

Akari: Right! And it's even more fun when you dance with a friend.

Haruka: Yeah.

Akari: There are tons of dancers around here. If you ever want to try another battle, just go up and ask. They might look scary, but they're good people. I'm sure they'd be glad to take you on.

Haruka: Will do.

Akari: There are some things in dance you can only learn on the streets. I bet it'll help you out in your career, too!

Haruka: I bet it would. Thanks for teaching me all of that stuff today, Akari-chan.

Akari: Hey, no need to be so formal. That's what friends are for, right?

Haruka: Hehe. Right.

Akari: Hehe. Well, I guess I’d better get going. Good luck with everything!

[She leaves.]

Haruka: (That dance battle was a lot of fun… Okay, I guess I'd better get back to the office.)

[Haruka walks to the office while dancing with passersby and practicing her skills. Walking into the Dyna Chair, she enters the office and approaches Horie.]

Haruka: Good morning!

Horie: Morning, Haruka-chan. You sound happy. Something good happen?

Haruka: A little, yeah.

Horie: Glad to hear it. Well, let's give it our best today. Let's get right to it. Well start off with today's schedule. Mind takin'a look at that schedule board?

[He teaches Haruka how to use the board.]

Horie: Look at the schedule board to see a list of jobs that are currently available. Select a job from this list in order to take it on. There is a wide variety of jobs. There will be more jobs and job types as the game progresses. Taking on jobs improves Haruka's idol abilities, so try to take on as many different jobs as you can. When you complete jobs, the agency will deposit your wages into your account. You can withdraw your wages at a convenience store ATM. Head to a convenience store whenever you need money. Okay, let's check out the schedule. You have two things on the board today. The big event, of course, is the Princess League finals at Soten TV in the afternoon. And in the morning, you have a handshake event sponsored by the fan club. Your lessons are important, naturally, but these kinds of activities are vital too, so keep plugging away at them. Okay. Let's head to the handshake event now. Okay, let's go!

[Haruka changes her clothes and applies makeup. With Horie they go to some place in the city.]

Horie: This is the place. Wonder where the staff is…

Uda: Good morning. I'm Uda, chairman of the Sotenbori Merchants Association. The Merchants Association sponsors Sawamura-san's fan club. It's very nice to meet you.

Haruka: (bows) Hello, Uda-san. It's very nice to meet you, too.

Horie: And I'm Horie, from Dyna Chair. Thank you for having us today.

Uda: Well, right this way, then… So, Haruka-san, have you ever done one of these handshake events before?

Haruka: No, this is my first time.

Uda: I see. That's all right. Well, let me give you a little rundown of how it's going to go.

[Handshake Events]
To raise fan satisfaction level, shake hands with as many fans as you can before time runs out. At the same time, make sure to keep an eye on the staff member who keeps the line of fans moving along. Lastly., be on the lookout for super fans wearing happi coats. They can raise the satisfaction level more than regular fans, but if disappointed, they can also lower it dramatically.

[The Remover]
While it's important to shake hands with each fan for as long as possible, the one must also be kept moving. This is the job of a staff member named Taro Hagashi, known as “The Remover.” He discourages fans from lingering too long and removes them if necessary. A fan who is removed leaves in fear, and the fan satisfaction level drops. Luckily, “The Remover” is also a big fan of yours. Use it to flash him a smile and he'll turn to mush and forget to do his job. You can use this to your advantage by smiling at the right time.

[How to Play]
When the command to shake hands appears on the screen, hold down (SQUARE). You will continue to shake hands with the fan until you release (SQUARE). During this time, the fan will speak to you. Use the directional buttons to choose your response. To raise the fan satisfaction level, choose the reply that matches the color of the fan's comment.

Uda: And that's about it… So, in a nutshell, we'd like you to meet as many guests as possible in the time that we have, and do your best to make them all happy. The best way to make 'em happy is by shaking hands with each one of them for as long as you can and carefully responding to what they say.

Haruka: I think you mentioned something about "removing," but could you explain what that means?

Uda: Oh, that. Well, if a handshake goes on a little too long, one of our staff will help move that fan along. In this business, we calt that "removing." It's an unfortunate necessity due to the nature of the event. What's more, fans who get removed," of course, feel disappointed and overall satisfaction drops. You'll want to shake their hands for as long as possible, but make sure you stop before they need to be "removed."

Haruka: I see. Phew, there's a lot more to these events than I thought…

Uda: By the way, that guy over there is the one in charge of monitoring the guests. He's “The Remover.”

[A bulky man approaches.]

The Remover: Don't you worry! I’ll defend your safety with my very life if need be! Say the word, and they're outta here!

Haruka: Huh? (bows) Uh, thank you… As long as you don't get too carried away…

Uda: And that just about covers it. Would you like for me to go through it again?

Haruka: No, thank you. I think I understand.

Uda: It's just about time. Thank you for doing this, and good luck!

[Haruka shakes hands with her fans for some time.]

Horie: Well, we'll be going now. Thank you for everything!

Uda: No, no. Thank you.

Haruka: (bows) Thank you. Goodbye!

Horie: Okay. Let's head back to the office, shall we?

Haruka: All right.

Horie: Uh-oh! Careful, Haruka-chan!

Haruka: What is it? What's wrong?

Horie: Look over there. See that woman? She's been watchin' you this whole time. Pretty suspicious if you ask me… She could be dangerous.

Haruka: Dangerous?

Horie: Yeah. Some fans can get so carried away they start stalkin' or harassin' their idol. You hear about that a lot these days. As your manager, I can't let anythin' like that happen to you. You stay right here. I’ll go get rid of her!

Haruka: Wait, Horie-san!

[Horie approaches the man looking woman in a designer purple dress and a crazy haircut.]

Horie: Hey, you!

Shady Woman: Are you talking to me?

Horie: You bet I'm talkin' to you! I saw you starin at Haruka. What's the big idea!?

Shady Woman: What? And just what are you accusing me of? You think I have any interest in that little country bumpkin!?

Haruka: Bumpkin..?

Horie: Then, what were you looking at?

Shady Woman: Well! If you must know, I was watching my ex-boyfriend. I just arrived in town, you see, so I thought I'd look him up.

Horie: Ex-boyfriend…

[Apparently she is stalking Uda-san…]

Horie: ……

Haruka: ……

Shady Woman: What's wrong with that!? Do I need your permission? You'd better apologize for throwing around such outrageous accusations!

Horie: I’m sorry… That was a terrible mistake on my par— Wait a minute! It’s you! 

Haruka: Horie-san, you know her?

Horie: You're Yoko-san, the famous stylist!

Haruka: Yoko-san?

Horie: Haruka-chan, you didn't know? Yoko-san is a world-famous stylist! With her hairstylin', her makeup techniques, and her theories on health and beauty, she's second to none when it comes to lookin' fabulous!

Haruka: Oh, wow! It's an honor to meet you.

Yoko: Oh, that's all behind me now. I’m not in the stylist biz anymore. These days, I'm just a regular okama in heavy makeup.

{As already said in Yakuza 4 okama are transvestites, or, simply said, men dressing as women (and not only that).}

Horie: With your talent!? That's such a waste! Say… I know! Won't ya consider stylin' our Haruka Sawamura here!?

Haruka: Me?

Horie: Haruka-chan, if you were styled by the famous Yoko-san, you'd be top class! Oh, Yoko-san, please say you'll do it!

Yoko: Like I said, I don't do stylist work anymore… Besides, there's no way this little potato face here's gonna turn out to be some diamond in the rough.

Haruka: ……

Yoko: ……Hehe.

Horie: No? That's a shame… We really coulda used your help to get through the Princess League.

Yoko: Princess League?

Horie: Yeah, it's a TV show that decides the number one pop idol in Osaka. Haruka here is just about to go on for round one of the finals. Would you like to come along? Just to cheer her on, I mean. Right, Haruka-chan?

Haruka: Oh, yes! We'd love for you to come!

Yoko: ……

Horie: (bows) Well, we'll be going. then. Apologies again for my mistake. Take care!

[He and Harula walk away.]

Yoko: Hmph. So, the little country bumpkin wants to turn herself into a princess? ……

[Horie and Haruka return to the office.]

Horie: You did great. There'll be a lot of events like this, so just keep up the good work. So, this afternoon is finally the start of the big Princess League finals. If you win, you'll make your major label debut with a top record company. And on top of that, our agency’ll finally make a big splash in Tokyo!

Haruka: Right.

Horie: Apparently, for the finals, you're going to have a simultaneous showdown with your opponent.

Haruka: Simultaneous?

Horie: Yep. You and your opponent will be on stage at the same time, performin' to the same song. The one who gets the most fans on their side by the end of the song wins.

Haruka: That's a different approach.

Horie: Ain't it? You'll be at it for three rounds, and your total score will determine the overall winner. Ooh, I’m startin' to get nervous myself!

Haruka: Come on, why are you nervous?

Horie: How can I not be!? Whether you win or lose here is huge for all of us! It could be the big break our agency needs!

Haruka: That's true. I'll do my best.

Horie: Sorry, didn't mean to put pressure on ya. But, seriously, with all the effort ya put in, I know you'll do just fine. And remember, it's the total score you're going for, so don't sweat it if you lose a round. You can make up for it in the others.

Haruka: Okay… Yeah, that helps take some of the pressure of.

Horie: Good. Just try to stay relaxed. Can't do your best if you're too nervous. Well, not much time before it starts. If you wanna prepare, now's the time to do it. Ogita-san's in the studio on the fourth floor. I'm sure he’d give you a lesson now if you want. When you're ready, come check the schedule board like ya did before.

Haruka: Okay, I will.

Compete In The Princess League
[As the Agency Levels Up]
The agency is paid whenever you complete jobs. As these payments build up, the agency's level rises. As the agency levels up, its publicity, media, and lessons are enhanced.
Publicity: Enhance publicity to add promotional event jobs, sponsored by Dyna Chair, Media: Enhance media to add TV and press jobs. Lessons: Enhance lessons to speed up growth.
The agency has reached level 2. You can now take on promotional event jobs sponsored by Dyna Chair. These jobs attract more fans than jobs sponsored by others.

[Gifts from Fans]
When the number of fans reaches a certain level, gifts for Haruka are delivered to Dyna Chair. Gifts can be found in the gift box next to the desks.

[Haruka takes some lessons from Ogita-sensei.]

Haruka: Yes! I think that went really well!

Ogita: Hmm. Good. You're comin' along alright. Well, ya heard it about a billion times already, so ya oughta know by now. The music for round one is a cutesy pop song, called “So Much More!” T-Set's specialty is hard dance numbers, so this song takes 'em a little outta their element. So, first round, I think ya got a chance. But ya better bust your butt practicin' if ya wanna win beyond that.

Haruka: (bows) All right, I will! Thank you very much! (Phew. I'm tired, but definitely feel accomplished. That's a job well done!)

[She goes to the board to see if there are any new assignments for her. She chooses "handshakes" and changes clothes. The scene changes to the street where Uda-san is talking to a staff member at the event.]

Event Staff: Ah, Uda-san. Sawamura-san is here.

Haruka: Hello, everyone!

Uda: Oh, Haruka-san! How have you been?

Haruka: Fine, thank you. I'm excited to be here today!

Uda: And we are excited to have you! I know we can always count on you to do a great job.

Haruka: I’ll certainly do my best!

Uda: By the way, are you comfortable with how handshake events work now?

Haruka: Actually, I'm still a little nervous about these kinds of things.

Uda: Not a problem. Would you like a reminder on how everything is going to go today?

Yes, I think so. 
No, that's all right. ✓

Haruka: No, that's all right. I don't want to keep the guests waiting. Should we get started?

Uda: Yes, excellent. All right, people! We're about ready to get started!

Event Staff: I’ll start letting the guests in!

[Haruka dedicates herself selflessly to the fans. She shakes hands and answers questions.]

Haruka: That was so much fun!

Uda: Great job, Haruka-san!

Haruka: (bows) Thank you, Uda-san.

Uda: The handshake event went extremely well today. All of the fans seemed pleased.

Haruka: Yes, I really enjoyed getting the chance to meet and talk to the fans directly.

Uda: I’m glad to hear it! We’re all very pleased with how today turned out. So, I’ve already discussed your compensation with your agency.

Haruka: Okay, thank you.

Uda: But I wanted to add in a little something extra from me.

Haruka: Really!? Are you sure?

Uda: Absolutely! It's just a small thank-you for all your hard work.

Haruka: Oh, thank you so much!

[She got a Club Sandwich.]

Uda: Don't mention it! I look forward to our next event together.

Haruka: (bows) Yes, me too. Thanks for having me!

[She returns to the office and chooses another task on the board. She and Horie go to SotenTV.]

Horie: Oh, before you get changed, let's go say hello to the producer, Manda-san. Oh, that's him! See him over there? That's the producer, Manda-san. Shall we?

[They approach the man in the pink shirt.]

Horie: Oh no. T-Set is with him. They dropped us in favor of Osaka Talent… Nothing for you to worry about, though.

Girl in Red: Make sure we get lots of support in the finals, Manda-san!

Manda: Oh, no problem there! You two draw a bigger crowd than anyone! Well, good luck today, girls! Mai-chan, Azusa-chan, take care of yourselves!

Girls: Thank you, sir!

Horie: Hello there, Manda-san! It's Horie, from Dyna Chair! I thought we'd come say hello before the show.

[Glanced at each other, Mai and Azusa trip unsuspecting Haruka, who falls right into the lap of the seated Manda, spilling his coffee.]

Manda: Hot!

Haruka: I'm so sorry!

Horie: Manda-san!

Manda: Just before the finals, too. That's one way to introduce yourself.

Mai: What's wrong with you? Do you even look where you're going?

Azusa: Seriously. You should really be more careful. Dyna Chair-san.

[The girls leave.]

Horie: We're so sorry, Manda-san! Here! I really can't apologize enough!

Manda: Sometimes, a single mistake is all it takes to lose everything. As for you, your career will never take off if you can't even get along with kids your own age.

Horie: (boes) We're very sorry, sir! C'mon, Haruka-chan! Hurry up and apologize to the man!

Haruka: (bows deeply) It was an honest mistake, sir!

Manda: Long as ya don't make another in the finals.

[He leaves and Haruka and Horie continue bowing as he walks away.]

Horie: Of all the rotten luck… Oh, man. I can't believe that happened…

Haruka: I'm so sorry. I'll try to make up for it on the stage.

Horie: T-Set… What a buncha brats… What's wrong with Osaka Talent, letting ‘em get away with that kind of behavior? …Oh well, there's nothin’ we can do about it now, Best you go and get changed. There's a room up here you can use, they said. Here it is. Go ahead.

[They approach their dressing room and then Horie notices Mai and Azusa.]

Horie: It's them!

Haruka: Horie-san!

Horie: Hey, you!

[He grabs Mai by the hand.]

Mai: Ow! What's that for?

Horie: Don't play dumb with me. I know you tripped Haruka on purpose! What's the big idea!?

Mai: Let me go! Nakai-san!

[A guy who looks like a yakuza comes out of the dressing room.]

Nakai: Dyna Chair-san. What's goin' on here? You harassin our girls?

Mai: Ow! You better hope that doesn't leave a mark! It'll ruin our performance!

Horie: But you tripped Haruka!

Nakai: I'd tone it down a little if I were you, hmm? If you're looking to start something, though, just know we won't hold back. Step on our toes… And we'll squash your little agency in no time flat.

Horie: ……

Nakai: What? You got something to say?

Azusa: No wonder Dyna Chair can't hold on to any of its talent!

Horie: Ngh!

Haruka: Horie-san, we don't have time for this. I have to get changed.

Mai: Oh, so you think you can just walk away, do you!? What do you intend to do about my arm!? What do you want?

Haruka: …Have you ever been to Okinawa?

Mai: Huh? What?

Haruka: Okinawa. Have you ever been?

Mai: Nope, never… Why do you ask?

Haruka: You'd like Okinawa. The sea is so pretty, and the air is clean and clear. All your troubles will melt away. You should go sometime. I could even tell you a few spots you wouldn't want to miss.

Mai: Huh!?

Haruka: Let's go. Horie-san.

[Haruka and Horie leave.]

Azusa: What's with her?

Nakai: I think she was sayin’ a little trip to Okinawa might cheer you sourpusses up.

Mai: (angerly) What!?

Azusa: Wait a minute. Just what're you implying, Nakai-san!?

Nakai: Hmm. Now I see what Park-san saw in her… All right. That's enough, girls.

Mai: Huh!? You've got to be kidding me!

Azusa: Haruka Sawamura…

Mai: Ooh, that girl really ticks me off.

[Meanwhile, in Haruka's dressing room…]

Horie: We've had some bad blood with Osaka Talent. Did ya know T-Set used to go to our trainin' school? But they just couldn't deal with the way Park-san does things, so they moved to Osaka Talent.

Haruka: I didn't know that.

Horie: I'd try not to agitate them too much if I were you… But no worries if ya do. I guess you gotta be tough if you wanna make it in this business.

Haruka: Agitate?

Horie: Huh? Isn't that what you were tryna to do by telling 'em to shove off to Okinawa?

Haruka: They just seemed stressed, that's all. Okinawa really is a wonderful place. If you ever get the chance, you should go see it for yourself someday. Watch all your worries disappear.

Horie: I see. Guess you're a girl of a much higher caliber than I realized. Well, anyway, we kinda got off to a bad start before the performance even started, but let's try and pull it together. You can do this! Your clothes are all ready to go, so go ahead and get changed. You can use the makeup that's here. I'll be waiting outside. Okay, good luck!

[He leaves the dressing room.]

???: I'm coming in!

Haruka: Huh? Yoko-san!? But isn't Horie-san…? Didn't you see my manager outside?

Yoko: Oh, him? Yes, I saw a fellow with a very serious face out there. He mustve been lost in thought.

Haruka: Oh, okay… Anyway, what brings you here?

Yoko: What brings me here? Hmm. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that you're a little country bumpkin?

Haruka: A bumpkin!? What do you mean!?

Yoko: A rugged little bumpkin fresh off the farm. You can't even stay on your feet, it seems.

Haruka: Oh… You saw that?

Yoko: I just happened to, yes. So those two are your opponents, is that right?

Haruka: Yes, that's right.

Yoko: Well, setting aside their obvious lack of manners, they certainly look professional. I don't know anything about your level of talent, but right now you're clearly at a disadvantage.

Haruka: That may be true, but what else can I do but do my best?

Yoko: Listen up, little bumpkin. I'm sorry if this stings a bit, but simply doing your best won't earn you any recognition in this industry. You have to learn to magnify your natural appeal several times over if you wanna make it. And right now, you don't know how. That's the biggest difference between you and your opponents.

Haruka: ……

Yoko: You just need a little push in the right direction, and I’m the perfect person to give it to you.

Haruka: What?

Yoko: No time for questions! Now, show me your outfit! Come on, let's see it!

Haruka: Okay!

[Together they make a pink, cute and extra girly dress for Haruka.]

Yoko: Hmm. Not bad, not bad.

Haruka: How! I've never looked this good before!

Yoko: Heh, see what happens when you're in the hands of a professional? Oh, by the way, bumpkin, I have a little present for you.

Haruka: What's this?

Yoko: A quick-change costume. It's an old, special design of mine, and I just can't bear to see it go to waste, so I want you to have it. Quick-change is all about timing, my dear. When you feel the time is just right, change into this and watch everyone be blown away!

Haruka: Oh, my goodness! Thank you so very much!

[Tutorial]
Now that Haruka has received a quick-change outfit from Yoko, she can use Climax Heat on the Princess League. When an icon like the one at the right appears during a concert battle. press the button indicated, and Haruka will change costumes. ldol Heat will then remain until the end of the song making button presses more effective. In order to use Climax Heat on the Princess League, your Climax Heat Gauge must be filled beforehand. Go see Yoko before the final round to fill your gauge.

Yoko: And now the rest is up to you, my little bumpkin.

Haruka: Thank you again, Yoko-san! But… why are you being so nice to me?

Yoko: Well… you remind me of someone. A certain idol I used to work on. But, in the end, I wasn't able to make her shine like she deserved.

Haruka: ……

Yoko: I see this as my second chance, part of my own little agenda, you might say. If that bothers you, feel free to say so.

Haruka: Bother me? Of course not! I’m very grateful to you.

Yoko: Good. Well then, I think I get going. You can find me under Iwao Bridge in Sotenbori if you ever want to learn more beauty secrets. Good luck, now.

Haruka: (bows) Thank you very much, Yoko-san!

[Yoko's Training]
There are many advantages to Yoko's training.
—It fills the Climax Heat Gauge.
—It boosts the number of times ldol Heat can be used.
—It greatly improves Appeal.
Train with Yoko before a Princess League round to prepare yourself for victory!

Horie: (behind the door) Hey, are you all ready?

Haruka: Yes, I'm ready.

Horie: Okay. I'm comin' in.

Haruka: What do you think? Do I look strange?

Horie: Actually, I'd say you look fantastic!

Haruka: Oh, I'm so glad! I don't have much experience with makeup and all.

Horie: Why, the way you look, even T-Set's fans'll be fallin' in love with you! Okay, I guess it's time. And don't worry. Just do what you've been practicin' in your lessons, and you'll be just fine. You've put a ton of effort into this. So have confidence in yourself.

Haruka: Right.

[Someone knocks the door.]

Horie: Come in!

Assistant Director: Excuse me. Sawamura-san, are you ready?

Haruka: Yes, I am.

[Haruka and the T-Set sings and dances to So Much More (lyrics by Ryosuke Horii, music by ZENTA)]

This silly dream… this ray of hope
Fading faster than scribbles on the pavement
Should I just' give in?
“Is this what you want?”
“Are you good enough?”
It's all I see-when I look in the mirror
I can't escape, my own reflection
When the tears won't dry
Wanna just not even try
I'll find the strength inside
Hope is all it takes to remake
Your dreams into reality
So don't let it slip away!
Are you ready? Go!
It's your time to show
That you are so much more than they could know
Hold your head up high!
Spread your wings and fly!
Just a bit of hope and you'll be shining
It's all up to me!
Just you wait and see!
The star is gonna shine so bright it hurts
And I will prove to you
That I can be so much more than that you see right now

[Haruka magically changes her dress to princess-like, complete with a diodema.]

Are you on the brink? Want to give it up?
Then let me start this over from the top!
You're too young to think, back on that you did
Questioning you every last decision
Whenever you fail, just get up and go
No matter how many times it takes
Your dream will come true, I promise you
Hold your head up high and run to it
You just need to believe
That you can be so much more that what we see right now

Dolce Kamiya: Thank you to Haruka Sawamura and T-Set! Those performances were absolutely fantastic! But this is no ordinary concert—it's a concert battle! So it's time to see who got the most love from our live audience members! I've just been told the count is in! Which idol team will be crowned… the winner!? The winner of our first round is… Haruka Sawamura! Congratulations! You really put your heart and soul into that performance!

Haruka: Thank you very much.

Dolce Kamiya: Just look at that face! This is a girl who's really given it her all!

Haruka: (shy) Well, I have to admit, I was hesitant about performing… But once I got going, I found I couldn't hold back my excitement! Before I knew it, it was all over.

Dolce Kamiya: Any words for your adoring fans?

Haruka: I'd never performed in front of this many people before, so I was actually really nervous. I'm so incredibly happy you chose me! Truly, I am! I’ll do my very best to make my performance in round two even better!

Dolce Kamiya: Haruka-chan, thank you very much! She rose above the pressure to conquer round one and I can't wait to see what she does next! Did everyone enjoy the show!? The crowd is cheering wildly! They can't get enough of you girls! But I'm afraid we've just about run out of time. It's been such fun for us all. Now… See you next stage!

[Haruka is going back to the dressing room.]

Horie: You did it, Haruka-chan! That was great! Truly amazing performance! Keep it up, and I’ll bet you'll win round two tomorrow, too!

Haruka: Really? I hope so!

Horie: Okay, let's head back to Sotenbori. We really should apologize to Manda-san again… But he's not answering his cell. I hope he ain't still mad…

Haruka: Me, too.

[They return to the streets of Sotenbori.]

Horie: Okay, next up is continuing your lessons from yesterday. But you must be tired after that. Why not take a little break and clear your head? I'll be back at the office.

Haruka: (bows) Thank you. I'll see you there a little later.

[After a while. She returns to the Dyna Chair office.]

Horie: Oh, there ya are. Welcome back. Oh, and by the way. Haruka-chan.

Haruka: Yes?

Horie: I almost forgot to tell you, but updated your bank book like you asked.

Haruka: Oh, I'm so sorry to have put that on you.

Horie: Hey, no problem. I crammed your schedule super full, so it's not like you had time to do it yourself.

Haruka: Well, thank you for doing that…

[She checks her phone.]

Haruka: (Oh, another bank transfer from Nagasu.) Uncle Kaz… Is this your idea of hiding from us?

Horie: What's up? You look happy.

Haruka: Hehe, it's a secret.

Horie: Okay, well, you got lessons starting at seven. First up is your voice lesson with Yamaura-san. Once you've changed in the dressing room, head on up to the fourth-floor studio like always.

Haruka: All right. Thank you.

Horie: Best of luck!

[Haruka leaves.]

Horie: Being a pop idol sure is hard work…

[Park comes out of the office and slaps Horie in the face.]

Park: Just get inside. I've had complaints from both Manda-san at Soten TV and Osaka Talent. You were supposed to watch over her! How could you let such a stupid thing happen!?

Horie: I, uh…

Park: I told you to keep her away from the others.

Horie: Well, I didn’t exactly—

Park: I don't want your excuses! Honestly, you're hopeless…!

Horie: ……

Park: Listen to me. Haruka doesn't have any naive illusions about the entertainment industry. The more she's exposed to the dark underbelly of this business, the more she's going to see it as just a job. And I can't have that. I want her to be able to form her own dream—one she can hang on to.

Horie: ……

Park: Some girls need to be taught to grasp the harsher realities. But Haruka isn't like that. Haruka needs something she can take with her wherever she goes!

Horie: ……

Park: Don't ever let anything like this happen again. No more mistakes.

Horie: Yes, ma'am, Forgive me

[Meanwhile Haruka changes in the locker room.]

Haruka: (I’m late. I have to hurry to the lesson studio.)

[She goes to the practice room.]

Yamaura: Haruka! You're late! Round two is gonna start soon, and we don't have a second to lose!

Haruka: Sorry, Yamaura-san!

Yamaura: Save it for later. Let's just get started. You ready?

Haruka: Yes, I'm ready!

Yamaura: There. See what you can do when you try? Hard to believe you were a complete amateur just a little while ago.

Haruka: Thank you.

Yamaura: Don't get too comfy, kid. You're not outta the woods yet. Next up is your dance lesson. Ogita-san's waiting for you in the office. Run down and get him, okay?

[She goes to the office to find out there is Ogita.]

Horie: Oh, hi, Haruka-chan. You're looking for Ogita-san, right? He's talking with Park-san in her office.

[Haruka and Hori approach the office door and hear screams coming from behind the door. Ogita arguing with Park.]

Ogita: Just who do ya think you're talkin' to, bitch? The hell's a hack like you know about dancin'!? Leave the teachin' to the pros, amateur!

Park: Ogita. I suggest you be more careful about who you mouth off to.

Ogita: Shut your trap!

Park: So that's how it is. You're fired. Gather your things and go.

Ogita: As if. The damn sun'll go cold before ya figure out how to teach that brat on your own! I’m the only reason she's come as far as she has. Lemme guess. Ya think 'cause you're holdin' the purse strings, you're automatically right. That ain't how the world works!

Park: Believe what you will But you're sadly mistaken. In this business, the one paying the bills is always right.

Ogita: What?

Park: You're nothing short of useless to me now. With the funds I have, I could replace you a hundred times over.

Ogita: You little…

Park: How long are you going to stand there? Get out of my office, now. You're wasting my time.

[She throws a lighted cigarette butt in Ogita’s face.]

Ogita: You bitch! N' my contract? You're gonna have to pay for breakin' it!

Park: Will I? There isn't a penalty clause, you know. I have no obligation to pay you if you don't complete the work I hired you for. Read your contracts before you sign them.

Ogita: What? I did read it! Wait a sec.  That "tweak" ya had to make before I signed on the dotted line… Ya didn't!

Park: If there's a problem, you can take it up with my lawyer.

Ogita: You double-crossin'…!

[He grabs Park by the collar and prepares to punch her.]

Park: Don't have the guts to hit me?

[He throws Park on the floor.]

Ogita: Fuck this!

[He leaves the office.]

Horie: Ogita-san!

Park: Horie! Let him go.

Horie: Ma'am!

Haruka: Are you all right, ma'am? I'll go get some ice!

Park: Wait, Haruka! Haruka. Horie. There's something I need the two of you to take care of.

Horie: What is it?

Park: You probably heard, but I just fired Ogita.

Horie: Okay. But where does that leave us? I'm afraid you've already fired just about every dance instructor in Kansai…

Park: That's why I have a task for the two of you. It would do you well to listen without interrupting.

Horie: Forgive me.

Park: I hear the dance instructor Christina is currently in Japan for a concert at Osaka Jo Hall. His full bio hasn't been made public. But they say there are many stars around the world whose talent has blossomed thanks to his guidance. I'm sure you can imagine what I'm going to say next.

Horie: Well, uh…

Park: Christina only teaches dancers he's taken a personal interest in. Apparently, he's not the type to be swayed by money or power. So we still have a chance with him. I want you to find Christina and get him to agree to teach Haruka.

Horie: What? Just outta the blue like that? Besides, the Princess League Finals have already started!

Park: Horie, are you looking to get fired as well?

Horie: Oh! No, ma'am! My apologies… I'll do my best.

Park: “Your best”? I don't want you to just do “your best.” I want you to get it done.

Horie: Yes, ma'am, I will!

Park: Are we clear, Haruka?

Haruka: Yes, ma’am.

Park: I suggest you start with Sotenbori. Rumor has it he goes barhopping there alone just about every night. In fact, he's likely sitting at one of those bars right now.

Horie: Got it. All right, Haruka-chan. Let's go find this guy.

Haruka: Right!

Horie: Let's start by seein' what we can find out. We can ask around town.

Find Christina
[Haruka and Horie go outside.]

Horie: Park-san said Christina might be drinking at a bar or something right now, didn't she? Do you know what Christina looks like?

Of course. ✓
I'm afraid not.

Haruka: Of course I do. He's famous, right?

Horie: …You sure?

Haruka: No, I'm sorry. I'm not really sure.

Horie: Thought so. He might be famous in our industry, but not much is known about him outside of it. Since when did you try to be such a know-it-all?

Haruka: (bows) I’m sorry…

Horie: Actually, I’ve only ever seen a picture of him once myself.

Haruka: What does he look like?

Horie: Let's see. In the picture I saw, he had a tan, and he was wearin' a pretty flashy outfit. Really looked the part, ya know? You'd think he'd stand out in a crowd, but I guess that ain't much to go on when it comes to actually tryin’ to find the guy.

Haruka: Well, we could ask around. Maybe someone's seen him.

Horie: That's true. Okay, where are the best places to go barhopping around here…? Hmm… Watami and Stijl Bar on Sotenbori Street are pretty famous. And Crest Bar in Hoganji Yokocho is pretty popular with those in the know. How ‘bout you go check out those three, and I’ll go search some of the less popular places?
Haruka: All right!

Horie: We'll meet up later. Good luck!

Haruka: (Okay. I go take a look.)

[Yoko's Training]
Carrying out training under the former celebrity stylist Yoko will mainly improve your Appeal. This training is also the only way to build up the gauge that lets you use Climax Heat special moves, which could decide your fate in the Princess League. You can also learn a range of other abilities and skills, like being able to use Idol Heat more times.

[Haruka visits Crest Bar.]

Bartender: This is no place for a little girl like you.

Haruka: I’m sorry to bother you. I'm actually looking for someone, and I think they may have been here. (How should I ask him about Christina-san?)

Did you see a dance instructor?
Did you see a flashy, tanned man? ✓
Have you seen a Christina?

Haruka: Was there a man here, deeply tanned and dressed kind of flashy?

Bartender: ……I’m really not supposed to blab about our customers, but you don't look like the type who’ll take no for an answer. Yeah, he was here.

Haruka: Really!?

Bartender: Yup. But as you can see, he's not here anymore. He mentioned that he still wanted a drink or two, so he could be hoisting drinks elsewhere.

Haruka: (bows) Thank you very much! Goodbye!

[She goes to another bar and sees a group of well dressed people.]

Haruka: Excuse me. Do you mind if I ask you a question? Were you just inside this bar?

Female Employee: Yeah. Why do you ask?

Haruka: Did you happen to see someone with tan skin and flashy clothes in there? I’m looking for him.

Female Employee: Tan skin and flashy clothes, huh…? Hmm. I don't think so. I probably would've noticed somebody like that. Hey, you see an old guy with tan skin and flashy clothes in there?

Haruka: I, um, didn't say he was old…

Businessman: Hmm? Nope. Don't think so.

Businessman: I didn't see anybody like that, either.

Female Employee: Well, there's your answer. Guess not.

Haruka: (bows) I see. Sorry for taking your time. Thanks, anyway!

Female Employee: Hey, you're pretty young. Should you really be out this late?

[Haruka goes to the nearest bar.]

Barkeep: You're underage, aren't you, miss? I’m sorry, but I can't serve you alcohol.

Haruka: I'm sorry to bother you. I’m actually looking for someone, and I think they may have been here. (How should I ask him about Christina-san?)

Did you see a dance instructor? 
Did you see a flashy, tanned man? ✓
Have you seen a Christina?

Haruka: Was there a man here that was really tanned and dressed all flashy?

Barkeep: Oh, that guy? Yeah, he was here a little while ago.

Haruka: Really!?

Barkeep: He said he drank too much, so maybe he went to go sober up somewhere.

Haruka: (bows) Thank you so much! I’ll be on my way!

[She comes out of the bar.]

Haruka: (Trying to sober up, huh? Maybe he's taking a walk?)

[Suddenly a girl walks up to her.]

Akari: Hi, Haruka.

Haruka: Huh? Oh, Akari! What a coincidence!

Akari: Yeah…

Haruka: What’s wrong?

Akari: Oh, nothing. So what are you doing? Shopping?

Haruka: I'm looking for a man named Christina. He supposedly has really tan skin and wears a lot of flashy clothes. You haven't seen anyone like that, have you…?

Akari: No way… I don't believe it.

Haruka: What is it? You're acting kind of funny, Akari.

Akari: Christina, right? Yeah, I know him. As a matter of fact, I just saw him.

Haruka: Hm? Really?

Akari: Sure. He was just on the Sotenbori Footpath. He might still be there. Come on!

Haruka: Okay!

[She leads Haruka to a well-dressed guy standing on the sidewalk.]

Akari: There. See that man? That's Christina. Christina-san!

Christina: Hmm? You're that dancer from before, aren't you? I believe I told you we didn't have anything further to discuss…

Akari: Yes, I know, but please give me one more chance! And this time. I brought a pro.

Christina: A pro?

Haruka: Akari, I don't understand.

Akari: Well, actually, some of my dancer friends told me earlier that Christina was in Sotenbori, so I already came and had him watch me dance. But when I was done, he said he wasn't interested in me…

Haruka: What!?

Akari: Christina-san, please give me another chance! Won't you watch me dance just one more time? I really want you to take me on as your dance student! want it more than anything!

Christina: ……

Akari: I brought a friend with me this time. She's a pro, a real pop idol! That's got to be interesting enough to let me have another try, right?

Christina: ……

Haruka: Akari, I don't know about this…

Akari: Come on. Haruka! Please!? Be a friend! I don't have the looks or the connections you do. I can't let this chance slip away!

Christina: …I don't know what's going on between the two of you, but, very well I'll watch you both dance.

Akari: You mean it!?

Christina: I do.

Haruka: Wait a minute! I'm actually here because I wanted to talk to Christina-san about work…

Christina: Dance first. Then we can talk.

Haruka: ……

Christina: I only work with dancers I'm interested in, you see. If you want to talk to me, you'll have to first draw my interest by dancing.

Haruka: ……

Christina: So what will it be?

Haruka: All right… I’ll do it. Let's show him what we can do, Akari.

[Haruka and Akari participate in an impromptu dance tournament. Despite Akari's best efforts, Haruka has more experience and wins.]

Haruka: *pant* *pant*

Akari: *pant* …Well, Christina-san, what did you think?

[Christina watched the dance in silence. He approaches Akari, then turns to Haruka.]

Haruka: ……

Christina: I have a feeling you and I will have a good talk, Haruka.

Haruka: Christina-san…

Akari: What!? Why!? Sure, Haruka danced well, but she wasn't that much better than me! So what gives!?

Christina: It's just as I told you before. Akari-san. I only work with dancers I'm interested in.

Akari: But…!

Christina: Look, I'm in a good mood today, so I'll share with you why I chose Haruka. Dancing is more than just technique. It's about how you express your feelings, how you let others see what's in your heart. That's the key.

Akari: My heart…?

Christina: I've judged countless auditions, and I've seen more dancers than I can remember. But the dancers who fail their auditions all have one very basic thing in common. They've let themselves become robotic, just dancing machines.

Akari: Machines…

Christina: They perform perfectly calculated dances, without even the slightest error. And yes, said precise movements are quite impressive… at first. But precision isn't what fascinates people. A true dancer moves the audience with her ability to express emotion through movement.

Haruka: ……

Christina: That's the difference between those who get their chance in the spotlight and those who are backup dancers for life—the difference between you and Haruka right now.

Akari: That's…

Christina: Don't dance for others' approval, Akari-san. Dance from the heart. Show the world how you feel.

Akari: (angerly) What are you talking about!? What's wrong with the way I dance!?

Haruka: Akari…

Akari: (crying) Forget it! I'm never going to dance again!

[She runs away.]

Haruka: Akari!

Christina: Let her be for now, Haruka.

Haruka: ……

Christina: She needs to figure things out for herself. It won't be easy, but it'll be best for her in the long run.

Haruka: But Akari's right. She's the one who showed me how much fun dancing can be. She's been a good friend to me,

Christina: In that case, you be a good friend to her, and show her that friends support one another and help each other grow.

Haruka: …Right. I will.

Christina: All right. That's enough of a lecture. It's time now for that talk I promised you. Something about work, was it?

Haruka: Yes. I wanted to ask you to be my dance instructor.

Christina: Me?

Haruka: Yes. Park-san, the president of my agency. Dyna Chair, would like to speak to you about it.

Christina: And instead of coming to see me, she sent the dancer herself… Actions speak louder, as they say. Heh, that's quite a competent president you have!

Haruka: So, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like you to come with me to my agency to meet her.

Christina: Very well. Lead the way.

[Haruka takes him to her agency's training room. Park and Horie are watching the training session.]

Christina: So let me get this straight. She has a concert in Tokyo in just a few days, and you want me to get her ready for it?

Horie: Yes. What do you think? With your considerable talents, do you think you could whip her into shape?

Christina: ……

Horie: Uh… Is that a “no”?

Christina: All I can do for Haruka is point her in the right direction. I'm sure you understand, Park-san?

Park: Indeed. Thank you.

Horie: Huh? I don't…

Christina: Haruka is the one dancing. All I can do is teach. Whether she succeeds or not is up to her. But I don't think you'll be disappointed. Haruka has amazing talent. It's simply incredible how far she's come in only six months of dancing. She must have put in extraordinary effort. So, the time we have left should be more than enough.

Haruka: Christina-san…

Park: (bows) I’ll leave Haruka in your hands. Thank you.

Horie: Park-san…

Christina: Okay. I have to head home for today. We'll start your real lessons tomorrow. I'll come up with a program for you. Does that sound all right?

Haruka: (bows) Yes, sir! Thank you very much!

[Christina leaves.]

Park: Christina is a true professional who has mastered the art of dance. I have complete confidence in leaving everything to him. You two did very well.

Horie: Oh, no, it was nothing. Haha…

Park: Nonsense… That said, today's work isn't over just yet.

Haruka: Huh?

Park: Haruka, get changed and come to my office. You too, Horie.

Horie: Yes, ma’am.

Haruka: Yes, ma’am.

[She changes her clothes and goes to Park's office, where Horie is already waiting for her at the door.]

Horie: Oh, there you are. Haruka-chan. Let's go in. Park-san's waiting for us.

[They walk to the office. Park carefully reads some documents. When Haruka and Horie knock on the door, she puts the papers away.]

Park: Come in.

Haruka: You wanted to see us?

[Park locks her safe with a special key.]

Park: Let me get straight to the point. I want the two of you to go to Soten TV right away. It's about the incident with Manda-san. I just called and apologized. Now I want you to go and apologize as well. I managed to set up a brief appointment with Manda-san,

Horie: Yes, of course. Let's go, Haruka-chan.

Hanuka: Right.

Park: Haruka, wait. Come here. Who taught you how to do your makeup?

Haruka: I taught myself.

Park: Your foundation is all uneven. And you don't have on lipstick or anything… This won't do. I'll have the makeup artist fix you up. Make sure you learn how to do it competently for next time.

Haruka: I’m sorry.

Park: Horie, will you please get the makeup artist?

Horie: But, Park-san, if we wait for the makeup artist, won't we be late to our meeting with Manda-san?

Park: Hmph. I swear, men make the worst managers… Never mind. I'll fix it myself. You wait outside.

Horie: I'm sorry…

[He leaves the office and Park begins to teach Haruka how to apply makeup.]

Park: Even the plainest girl can shine with proper technique. And a pretty girl like you? It could really put you a grade above. You should think about getting some more fashionable clothes, too. Don't be content thinking you're pretty enough just the way you are.

Haruka: But I'm not pretty. Not even a little.

Park: All the more reason you should learn how to perfect your makeup, then. Refining your image is no easy task. But now that you're in the industry, you have to be in constant pursuit of beauty. Something funny?

Haruka: I'm just happy.

Park: Happy I lectured you?

Haruka: I never thought we'd be doing stuff like this. Stuff like putting on makeup together. I'm really glad.

[Park smiles and continues to apply mascara to Haruka's lashes. After a while she finishes. Haruka becomes even more beautiful - the makeup only accentuates her natural beauty. Park fixes her hair.]

Park: I guess it's true, then. That every girl needs a mother. Haruka. Next time I’ll take you to the hottest fashion spot in town. We'll spruce up that wardrobe of yours.

Haruka: Do you mean it?

Park: I always mean it. Have I ever proven otherwise?

[Haruka nods.]

Park: There, all done. Do your best today.

Haruka: I will. And, um… I appreciate all your help!

[She leaves the office and approaches Horie.]

Horie: All right. Let's head over to Soten TV. I'll go get us a taxi, and you can catch up with me.

Haruka: Okay. Sounds good.

[She goes outside.]

Haruka: (Horie-san's waiting for me at the taxi stand.)

Head for Soten TV
Horie: Haruka-chan, are you ready to go?

Yes ✓
No

Haruka: I’m all set.

Horie: Okay, off we go, then.

[They arrive at Soten TV.]

Horie: Okay, let's find Manda-san.

Horie: Manda-san!

Manda: Ah, the people from Dyna Chair…

Horie: (bows) We're terribly sorry about earlier today!

Haruka: (bows) Our sincerest apologies!

Manda: Wait. Hold it right there.

Horie: Pardon?

Manda: Good timing, you two! This is perfect.

Haruka: Huh?

Manda: Well, we had that famous model—I can't seem to remember her name—scheduled to go on our game show, but she up and canceled last minute! The studio's in an uproar! But here you people come along like a gift from up above! What do you say? Think you can take her place, young lady?

Horie: Wha…? Yes, of course! Haruka's schedule is open for the rest of the day. Whaddya think, Haruka-chan? Can you do it? He said it's some sort of game show…

Yes, of course! ✓
I’m really bad at that kind of thing…

Haruka: Yes, of course! rd love to go on!

Manda: Great! That's the spirit! Hey, Hayashida! I found a fill-in!

Program Director: A fill-in…? Wait! You're Haruka Sawamura! Wow! Aren't we lucky! All right, let me explain how it's going to go. Right this way, if you would.

Haruka: Yes, of course!

[They go to the dressing room.]

Assistant Director: Hello, Sawamura-san. Thank you for coming.

Haruka: Hello. Thank you very much for having me!

Assistant Director: Have you ever watched the show you're going to be on today?

Haruka: No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I haven't.

Assistant Director: All right. Then let me give you a brief rundown. Sotenbori Love Check Quiz is a late-night quiz show. As the title suggests, the show features trivia questions about Sotenbori, and tests the contestant's love for the town.

[Haruka goes out into the hallway.]

Horie: Fantastic job, Haruka-chan!

Haruka: I was a little nervous.

Horie: Well, it didn't show. You really stood out!

Haruka: Thank you.

Horie: Anyway, let's go see Manda-san again.

Haruka: All right.

Manda: You did good. Good enough to make up for earlier. Besides, I owe Park-san a favor or two from back in our heyday.

Horie: Still, we must apologize for what happened!

Haruka: I really am sorry, sir!

[They both bow deeply.]

Manda: It's all in the past now. Water under the bridge. By the way, Haruka-chan.

Haruka: Yes, sir?

Manda: That makeup. Did you do it yourself?

Haruka: Oh, no. Our boss helped me.

 Manda: That so? Park-san, huh?

Horie: Is there… something wrong with it?

Manda: No, not at all. Didn't mean to offend. It's just when I look at Haruka-chan… I can't help but think of Park-san when she was young.

Horie: Our Park-san?

Manda: Morning, noon and night… Some women get more beautiful every time you see them. Ya know, in this line of work, ya can't be too sure of how a girl's gonna do. They're always changing, growing. I could've sworn T-Set had it in the bag. But I'm starting to think you might give 'em a run for their money. Eh, don't mind me. Anyhow, good luck in the Princess League, ya hear?

[He leaves. Haruka and Horie go outside for some fresh air.]

Horie: This is wonderful! Seems like the tide is really turning in our favor. Only thing left to do is ride the wave!

Haruka: ……

Horie: Huh? What's wrong?

Haruka: I'm a little nervous…

Horie: Hey, none of that, now! You're going to be just fine! Christina is here for you, and you know Park-san and I are always in your corner. So chin up!

Haruka: You're right… I can do this!

Horie: Yeah, that's the spirit! Oh, I just remembered. I gotta head back to the agency, but you should run on home. You sure had a lot on your plate today. You must be exhausted!

Haruka: Thank you.

Horie: I'll see ya tomorrow, then. Be safe getting home! I'll see ya tomorrow, then. Be safe getting home!

Haruka: (bows) I will. (Horie-san is right. It was quite a day… I think I’ll hurry home and get some sleep.)

[She gets home and falls on her bed dead tired.]

Haruka: (I have lessons in the morning. Maybe I should get some sleep.)

Chapter 2: HOPE LIVES ON
[Morning. Haruka wakes up and gets out of bed. It's a bright sunny day outside.]

Haruka: (Mmm, that was a good sleep. Okay, I’d better get to the office for my lessons.)

[She goes outside.]

Haruka: (Oh! An email from Akari!)

[E-Mail]
A favor
Akari
Long time no see.
My dancer friend has been bugging me about having a dance battle with you, Haruka.
Would you mind taking her on for me?
She said she'll be waiting near a tree on the Sotenbori Footpath.

Haruka: (Someone wants to have a dance battle with me? I wonder what they're like. I’m actually a little nervous. But it's Akari's friend, and I do want a chance to try to make it up to Akari for the other day. So, the Sotenbori Footpath, somewhere behind Zuboraya near the trees. Got it! I’ll go check it out.) 

[She goes to meet Akari.]

Haruka: (I wonder how everyone's doing back home? I miss it… Oh, that's right! Yamaura-san said I have an interview with an Okinawa tourism magazine. I've been so busy, I nearly forgot! Oh, I got an email.)

[E-Mail]
It’s Ayako. 
Morning Glory 
Thanks for the money, Haruka. Don't overdo it, okay? We saw you on TV the other day! All of us at Morning Glory were thrilled.

Haruka: (Aw, they're all watching me on TV? That's so nice! It makes me happy, even though it's kind of embarrassing! I’d better write back… “I’m so glad to hear from you! Is everything okay back home?” Oh, she answered back already! She's getting good at this email thing.)

[E-Mail]
It’s Ayako. 
Morning Glory
Thanks, but we're fine! We're as happy as ever here. How about you? Want us to send you some goya?

{Goya, also known as “bitter melon” or “bitter gourd” in English, is the green, bumpy, cucumber-shaped vegetable grown in Okinawa.}

Haruka: (Yay, I don't have to worry! Of course, I don't want them to worry about me, now… Let's see. “No, thanks, I'm good on goya! Soon I'm going to do an interview for a tourism mag. Maybe you'll all get to read it!” That’ll get them excited! Can't wait to see how they react. Come on, Ayako! Why are you taking so long to write back? Oh, here we go!)

[E-Mail]
Ayako here. 
Morning Glory
Is that interview the one where you answer questions from readers? Make sure you do a good job!

Haruka: (Hm, why is she being so pushy? I’ll just tell her, “Okay, thanks, Ayako! I'm off to work now. Talk later! Love, Haruka.” It's a relief to hear everything's all right back home. That last message was weird, though. Uh-oh! It's time for the interview! I better hurry to the Bunzaemon Outdoor Mall studio.)

[She comes to the office of her agency.]

Haruka: Good morning.

Horie: Morning. Haruka-chan. Christina just got here, too. He should be in the studio. Head on up when you're ready.

[Haruka changes into her workout outfit and goes to the training room, where Christina is already waiting for her.]

Christina: Good morning, Haruka. Today, we begin your lessons in earnest. We don't have much time left, so I'm really going to need your focus. Now, are you ready to begin?

Haruka: I'm ready. Thank you for doing this!

Christina: It's my pleasure. Let's get started.

[Haruka trains hard for a while.]

Christina: Excellent, Haruka! That was very nice!

Haruka: Thank you very much!

[Horie enters.]

Horie: Ah, Haruka-chan. Sorry to interrupt, but an urgent job just came in. When you get a sec, can you come to the office? I'll tell ya all about it.

Haruka: Of course.

Christina: An urgent job? In that case, you'd better hurry along. We'll stop the lesson here for now.

Haruka: Right. Thank you!

[She changes her clothes and goes to the office.]

Haruka: Sorry to keep you waiting,

Horie: Sorry to do this so out of the blue. Mind takin' a look at the schedule board there? Sorry to hurry you, Haruka-chan, but could you head out to that civic event?

Haruka: A civic event? So this just came in?

Horie: That's right. They're havin' a civic event in the park nearby. Set up a special stage and everythin'. The singer they booked caught a cold and lost her voice, so they need a sub. They asked us to find a replacement fast. You up for it?

Haruka: Of course.

Horie: If I'm bein' honest with ya, the location ain't the best. We can't expect much of an audience. I said that to Park-san, but she said it's important to just get used to performin' on a stage.

Haruka: No problem.

Horie: I'm afraid I'm all tied up here. Yamaura-san's already over there waitin' for ya, though. Sorry to ask, but do ya think you could hurry on over?

[Haruka arrives at the place where a young girl named Yamaura is already waiting for her.]

Yamaura: Haruka! Over here! Good, you're here. Been waitin' for ya.

Haruka: This is where I'm going to sing?

[The stage looks like a pile of garbage.]

Yamaura: Most of the audience left once they heard the person they came to see wasn't gonna make it. She was supposed to perform and do a meet and greet, apparently… To be honest, it's a pretty crummy gig, but at least you'll get a chance to practice performing on a stage.

Haruka: That's true.

Yamaura: Okay. Better get changed.

[Haruka changes to her go-out outfit.]

Yamaura: Hey, not bad. Not bad at all.

Haruka: Thank you.

Yamaura: Okay. Well, there aren't many people here, and I don't imagine it'll be easy to get 'em warmed up. But see what you can do. Try to gather more people with your singin'. Good luck.

Haruka: All right. I will!

Yamaura: Good. Go get 'em, Haruka.

[Haruka sings and dances and attracts a lot of people.]

Yamaura: Nice work out there, Haruka. You're a real crowd pleaser. Good for you. Bet you're feelin' a little more confident now, huh?

Haruka: Yeah, a little.

Yamaura: Oh, almost forgot. There's a meet and greet now, too. Better get right to it.

Haruka: Me? But I'm just a sub…

Yamaura: That's all right. Not like there's that many people here, anyway. Don't worry about it. Hey, nobody said bein' a pop star would be easy.

Haruka: Hello. It's very nice to meet you. Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you so much for coming today,

Kindly Old Man: You're Haruka Sawamura-chan, aren't you? I've been watching you on the Princess League. Wishing you the very best of luck!

Haruka: Thank you.

Kindly Old Man: I'll be rooting for you! You hear?

Haruka: That's very kind of you. Thank you!

Yamaura: All done! You tired?

Haruka: No, I'm all right.

Yamaura: Good answer! Because you gotta go downtown before goin’ back to the office. Park-san sent Horie-kun out to buy something for her. Go find him and ask about your schedule for the rest of the day. He should be at Don Quijote.

Haruka: Okay, I will.

[She finds Horie.]

Horie: Oh, Haruka-chan. How did it go? No major mishaps?

Haruka: I think it went okay…

Horie: Musta been a rough assignment. But there'll be plenty more like it in the future, I’m sure. Don't let it get to you.

Haruka: I won't. By the way, what's my schedule like for the rest of the day?

Horie: Oh, Park-san didn't tell ya?

Haruka: Tell me what?

Horie: She said that, when you get back, she's gonna take you out shoppin' for cute clothes and whatnot.

Haruka: Really?

Horie: In fact, she's probably waitin' for ya at the office right now.

Haruka: She remembered…

Horie: She's a real woman of action, that Park-san. Me'd better scoot back. 

Haruka: Right.

Horie: Oh, that's right! I gotta stop by the drugstore first.

Haruka: The drugstore?

Horie: Yeah, for Park-san's hand. It's still swollen, so she asked me to pick up a compress.

Haruka: I'll go with you, then. I've been worried about her hand.

Horie: Okay, great. Ready to go, then?

Haruka: Ready.

[They walk together.]

Haruka: Oh…

Horie: Hm? What is it?

Haruka: Do you think one of these would look nice on Park-san?

Horie: Huh?

Haruka: I think I'd like to look at these a little more.

Horie: Take your time. I'll take care of the drugstore thing and head back.

Haruka: Thank you.

Horie: See you, then. Don't be too late, now.

Haruka: I won't.

[Horie walks away, and Haruka pulls out her wallet.]

Haruka: Oh, good. I have enough.

[She buys a trinket as a gift for Park.]

Shop Clerk: Thank you. Will this be a gift?

Haruka: Yes.

Shop Clerk: I’ll go get some wrapping paper, then.

[The clerk leaves. Suddenly Mai and Azusa approach Haruka.]

Mai: Well, well. If it isn't little Haruka-chan.

Azusa: What're you doing here? Ugh! What a tacky-ass brooch! The hell were you thinking?

Haruka: ……

Azusa: Cat got your tongue or something?

Azusa: We're just asking what you're doing.

Haruka: I was… buying Park-san a present.

Azusa: Oh, okay! Now it all makes sense. That ugly brooch will be perfect for her!

Haruka: ……

Mai: Hey, did you know that old has had a failed singing career? She made her debut then crashed and burned before anyone even noticed her. Hilarious, right?

Haruka: ……

Mai: Do you really think somebody who couldn't make a name for herself can do any better for you?

Haruka: ……

Azusa: Don't tell me you actually think you stand a chance at winning the finals. You ought to wake up and realize that you're really only there to make us look good.

Haruka: ……

Azusa: It's fixed, you know. I hear the producer Manda-san and our agency already have an agreement.

Mai: You'd drop that agency if you had any sense. Anywhere's got to be better than that washed-up wannabe's pathetic little excuse for an agency, don't you think?

Haruka: (serious) Stop it.

Azusa: What? Just giving some friendly advice. You're just as moody as that old witch you work for.

Haruka: If you put her down again…

[The girls surround Haruka. Mai knocks the brooch out of her hands and steps on it.]

Mai: What’ll you do? Huh?

Haruka: If you insult Park-san again… You'll be sorry.

Mai: Ooh, scary. But you should know. If our agency wanted to, it could crush yours under its heel. Just like an ugly little brooch.

Azusa: If you want to stick around, I suggest you get down and beg for forgiveness. Or do you want to fade into obscurity just like your washed up boss?

Mai: Think I'll make a little call. This is the end for you and that hag.

[She starts pushing buttons on her cell.]

Haruka: Don't… Please, don't do it.

Mai: What, is that it?

Haruka: (slowly kneels) I'm begging you… Stop.

Mai: Your head's not low enough. Come on, touch the ground.

[Suddenly Horie rushes in.]

Horie: Hey! What do you think you're doing!?

Park: It's all right, Horie.

Haruka: Park-san…

Park: It's been a while. You two seem well.

Mai: Yeah, whatever.

Park: Haruka. Go ahead and beg for their forgiveness.

Mai: Are you serious?

Park: Quite. Provided that's what you really want.

Azusa: What are you talking about?

Park: Celebrities nowadays don't really get "time off." Except when they're at home, maybe. As soon as Haruka steps outside, she's on the clock. In blogs, on social media… Rumors both good and bad can spread like wildfire these days. Imagine what they'd say about you making another idol apologize like this. I doubt it'd be positive.

[People begin to gather around them. Azusa tries to hide her face.]

Park: Try to trip your rivals and you may end up tripping yourself instead. I've seen it all too many times. Will you fall into the same trap?

Azusa: Come on, Mai. These people clearly can't take a joke.

Mai: Yeah. Bunch of idiots.

[They walk away.]

Park: Mai. Azusa. You used to work for us, so let me give you a little piece of advice. Real talent doesn't lie. If you're afraid of the competition, it typically means you doubt your own abilities. If you're afraid of the competition, it typically means you doubt your own abilities.

Azusa: Who, her? I'd hardly call her competition!

Park: Then why bother with her at all? You could be using that time to hone your skills. People will tire of you before long if a cute face is all you have to offer.

Mai: Come on.

[The girls leave. Haruka gets up from her knees.]

Park: Haruka. Thank you.

[She takes the brooch out of her hands.]

Haruka: This is just..

Haruka: Hm? I thought you got me a present.

Haruka: But it's…

Park: Silly me. Here I'd assumed you had chosen a sweet, thoughtful gift for me. I love it. That design is really something. Thank you.

Haruka: Park-san…

Park: Now, a promise is a promise. It's time we do a bit of shopping. I have something to take care of first. Do you mind waiting at the office? I'll be back soon.

Haruka: Okay!

Park: Please wait for me at the office. I’ll be there soon.

[Haruka returns to the Dyna Chair.]

Christina: Hello, Haruka. The event in the park must've been quite an experience for you. But you really are coming along nicely. I must say, it makes it a joy to teach you. Your former instructor will be quite vexed, I'm sure. Come see me at the studio any time you're ready for a lesson.

Haruka: (Did I get any gifts from fans? Oh! What a nice gift! I'm so happy!)

[Haruka walks into Park's office.]

Park: Sorry for the wait, Haruka, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to wait just a little longer. I have a few things I need to take care of. I won't be long.

[The next scene.]

Park: I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow. So, I'm leaving Horie a memo on things to do while I'm gone.

Haruka: But… why are you writing it with your left hand?

Park: Oh, that? Remember when Ogita pushed me down? I hurt my right hand pretty badly in the fall.

Haruka: I don’t understand I thought you were right-handed.

Park: I am. But that wasn't the case at first. When I was placed with my foster parents, they insisted I switch to my right hand. They were quite strict about it. I suppose that's not how kids are raised nowadays. Back then, it was common practice. There. All done.

Park: Sorry to keep you waiting. I cleared my schedule for the evening. Are you all ready to go? 

Haruka: Yes, I’m all ready.

Park: Then, let's go. You've been working hard every day, and I'm sure you must have built up some stress. So tonight, we're going to go shopping and get rid of all that. How does that sound?

Haruka: Great!

Park: All right. Let's go have some fun. We’ll do a little shopping first. Where do you usually buy clothes?

Haruka: Clothes? I haven't really done any clothes shopping since I’ve been here. I did buy a jacket at a department store, though…

Park: And you want to be a pop idol? Listen to me. Everything you wear, eat, see, and hear is an important opportunity to learn and grow. Make it a goal to always be trying out the latest trends for yourself and learn the classic styles that never go out of fashion. That's the first step to becoming an idol, a “true icon” of your time.

Haruka: Yes, ma'am!

Park: Good, that's what I like to hear. All right. Shall we make our way to Le Marche, then? They have a wonderful selection.

Haruka: All right. Thank you.

[They go to the store.]

Manager: Ah, Park-sama! Always a pleasure to see you.

Park: How are you this evening?

Haruka: (Wow! They know her name at an expensive place like this..? She must be a regular.)

Park: Today, I’m looking for an outfit for this young lady.

Manager: Very good, ma'am. In that case, what do you think of these?

Park: Hmm… Haruka, I’d like you to choose.

Haruka: Me!? You want me to pick!?

Park: That's right. You can't just wear what someone else tells you to wear. You have to develop your own sense of style.

Haruka: So it's another step on the road to becoming an idol? All right. I’ll give it a try.

Manager: Shall we do your top first?

Haruka: Pardon?

Park: You know, blouses, sweaters, things of that nature…

Haruka: Oh, my top. Yes, all right.

Manager: Very good. Do any of these catch your eye?

[Pink Blouse]
Designed by a well-established English brand, this blouse uses the finest fabric for the utmost in comfort.

[Leopard Print Coat]
This coat is generously trimmed with this year's most fashionable fur and designed to attract eye-popping attention.

[White Sweater]
This luxurious, one-hundred percent cashmere sweater has a feminine off-the-shoulder design.

Haruka: Um… I like this.

Park: That's a nice choice.

Haruka: Do you really think so? That makes me happy!

Park: Well, everything in this boutique is high-end, so you really can't go wrong in any case.

Haruka: I guess that's true.

Manager: Now, shall we move on to your bottoms?

Haruka: You mean pants and skirts and stuff, right?

Park: You catch on quick. Go ahead and choose one of these.

[Black Pants]
These distinctive black pants accentuate a woman's figure. They are highly sought after by models overseas.

[Leopard Print Miniskirt]
This pretty miniskirt is designed to accentuate the legs and make them look longer.

[Gray Flared Skirt]
The finishing touch on this vintage-style flared skirt is its extensive use of handcrafted lace.

Haruka: I think this would go well with that top.

Park: You're already thinking about mixing and matching, I see. Very nice. We'd also like a good pair of shoes.

Manager: Certainly. We have a lovely selection. What would you say to something like these?

[Leopard Print Pumps]
These sexy pumps are made from slink leather.

[Short Black Boots]
Trimmed with rabbit fur, these distinctive-looking short boots perfectly express the season and a lady's femininity.

[Long Camel-colored Boots]
Made with real leather, these long boots feature an elegant, ankle-thinning profile.

Haruka: These are pretty…

Park: Excellent choices. Everything will coordinate very well. We’ll take this as well.

[She chooses a red bag.]

Haruka:  Oh, it's beautiful…

Park: And now, we're all set. We’ll take all of this.

Manager: Thank you very much, Park-sama. One moment, please.

Haruka: Oh! But I didn't even look at the price tags!

Park: What did I tell you? Tonight is all about getting rid of stress. You don't need to worry about a thing. It's on me.

Haruka: Thank you very much, Park-san.

Manager: Here you are. My apologies for the wait.

Park: Thank you. All right, Haruka. Shall we?

Haruka: Yes, ma'am.

[They walk out of the store.]

Haruka: Park-san, please let me carry that.

Haruka: No, that's all right. Now, what shall we do next? 1s there anywhere you'd like to go?

Haruka: Well, let's see. Actually, I’d love to go to an arcade. The kids at school are always talking about it, and it sounds like so much fun.

Park: An arcade? Yes, it might be a good chance to see what other kids your age do. All right, then. Let's go.

Haruka: Oh, thank you!

[They go together.]

Park: I haven't been to an arcade in years. What kind of games are popular nowadays?

Haruka: Well, some kids in my class were talking about Taiko No Tatsujin. Oh, here it is!

{Taiko No Tatsujin or 太鼓の達人 (“Master of the Drums”) is real and quite popular game in Japan. This is a rhythmic game that uses the drums as a controller.}

Park: Oh, look. It says two can play. Are you up for a little friendly competition, Haruka?

Haruka: Do you know how to play?

Park: Well, I imagine you just hit the drum with the sticks, so how hard could it be? Okay, yeah, let's try it!

Haruka: But what about your hand?

Park: Don't you worry about me. Besides, you're going to need all the help you can get. But you have to promise to do your best, or it won't be any fun. If you hold back on me because I'm the president, I’ll dock your pay!

Haruka: I won't! I promise!

[They play and Haruka wins!]

Haruka: Woohoo— Oops… I'm sorry, that was rude.

Park: Phew… It certainly takes a bit of strength, doesn't it? Your dance lessons must have built up your stamina. Your sense of rhythm isn't bad, either. But enough about work. That was really fun. Let's play again sometime. You'd better be ready for me!

Haruka: Yes, let's!

Park: What else do they have here, I wonder? Oh, look. A PrintCircle machine. Let's try this, Haruka. I’ve actually never done one of these before.

Haruka: You and me, together?

Park: What, you don't want to?

Haruka: No, it's not that. I'm just… happy. I never imagined spending a day like this with you.

Park: …Who would ever imagine the president of Dyna Chair taking PrintCircle photos?

[They go to the booth.]

Park: So how do we do this?

Haruka: Let's see. Uhh, first we… We choose some frames… There. How about these? Okay. ready? Here we go!

Park: Wait a minute. Where are we supposed to look?

Haruka: Look, we're already on the screen. See? It's about to take the—

Park: What? Why didn't you warn me!?

Haruka: Ahaha! I did!

Park: Well… that won't do at all! I demand a do-over!

Haruka: Really? But they're nice pictures!

Park: No way! Absolutely, positively not! A do-over!

Haruka: Okay, okay. Ready? Here goes!

Park: There. Much better.

Haruka: Okay, and now we can add doodles to this picture. Like this…

Park: These came out very well, I’d say. The machine even erased the wrinkles on my face. I should hire this thing to replace Horie.

Haruka: Oh, that's terrible! Hehehe.

Park: Hahaha! Ah, that was fun. Well, should we get going?

Haruka: Yes. I suppose we should.

[They get out of the arcade and happily walk down the street.]

Girl: Mama! What's for dinner?

Mama: What do you want, Sa-chan?

Girl: Um… How 'bout curry!?

Mama: Curry it is, then!

Girl: Ya mean it? Let's go home and eat!

Mama: Okay, okay.

[Haruka watches them and smiles. Park grabs her hand and they walk down the street together. Some time later they call a taxi.]

Park: Well? Did that calm your nerves a bit?

Haruka: Yes, very much so!

Park: Things will be ramping up again tomorrow. This'll be our last chance to relax for a while. Your lessons will be relentless. Can you handle that?

Haruka: Of course. I'll do whatever it takes.

Park: Haruka? Here. I have a gift for you. To thank you for the brooch.

[She holds out her expensive-looking box, which is usually used to store jewelry.]

Park: It's a bit early, but this is to commemorate your big debut.

Haruka: What? But you've already given me so much.

Park: Don't worry about that! Just open it.

[Haruka opens the box and there… A pen. That's good too, but I thought it was a necklace! By the way, handmade pens are also a frequent gift in Japan.]

Haruka: Isn't this your pen, ma’am? Are you sure? This looks really expensive!

Park: It doesn't just look expensive. It is. Take good care of it.

Haruka: I'll treasure it.

Park: That fountain pen has a story. It was a gift back when my debut was announced, from someone very dear to me. It's been my good luck charm ever since. It's been my good luck charm ever since. I even brought it on stage with me the night of my debut hidden behind the mic.

Haruka: Wow. You must have been really nervous, huh?

Park: That night was child's play in hindsight. It's what comes after your debut that really matters. In my case, my whole life got turned upside down.

Haruka: What happened?

Park: Well, when I debuted at eighteen… I was already married. To the man who gave me that pen. Of course, I kept it a secret from my agency, and the world. I was already hiding both my troubled upbringing and my Korean ancestry. My marriage was just one more needle in the haystack. I went surprisingly fine for a time. But one day… I realized I had gotten pregnant. I got rid of it right away. I didn't hesitate much at the time. I was still so young. I thought it was just a sacrifice I had to make as an idol. I didn't tell my husband until afterward. He had never hit me before that. And then… he left. Said he'd just be holding me back from my dream if he stayed. I accepted it as another necessary sacrifice. But not long after my agency found out that had been secretly married. They were hesitant to promote me after that. My scandal was a ticking timebomb waiting to blow. So naturally they didn't want to invest in me. Event after event was scratched off my schedule. Even a massive concert at the Japan Dome. It would've been spectacular.

Haruka: You were such a big deal, ma’am. I had no idea.

Park: That concert was my dream. I was going to show the world. Show the family that abandoned me… that I'd finally made it. Not bad for a girl who wasn't even loved by her own parents. I thought maybe just maybe my ex would come to cheer me on, too. Silly, right? But it never came to be. My agency made sure of that. Forget the concert. I could barely ewen book a gig after that. Until finally, even the smallest leads dried up. Learning I could no longer bear children was the final insult I was broken.

Haruka: I'm so sorry.

Park: I wasn't sure if I'd ever make amends for what I sacrificed to become a star. Thinking back on it, maybe that's why I wanted to help develop a successful idol. Perhaps I'm just struggling to find some form of redemption. Either way, this is all I have left. Sorry to have dragged you into this.

Haruka: Don't say that! I'll work hard, for you and me both, ma'am.

Park: Thank you Haruka. And you know… Thanks to you, I may have already gotten back a bit of what I lost. Not long ago, I did a magazine interview. When it was announced you'd be in the Princess League finals. My ex-husband naturally caught wind, and sent me this letter. 

[She pulls out a long envelope with handwritten words on it 朴美麗様. The envelope has the addressee's name written on it, that translates as “To Ms. Park Mirei”.]

Park: He asked me to meet him in Tokyo. Truth be told, I thought I'd never see him again. He chose to walk a path I could never follow him down. Until now, I hadn't heard a single word from him.

Haruka: Ma'am… But, this is so important to you. I can't possibly accept it.

Park: Of course you can. Though actually, there's something I need in return. Though actually, there's something I need in return. Haruka. I have… a favor to ask of you.

Haruka: What is it?

Park: It's been so long since I've seen my ex… I've aged more than I care to admit. I… don't want him to be disappointed in what he sees. Do you think you could meet him in my place? Afterward, you can bring him over to me. I'd prefer he didn't see this old, haggard face in any bright light.

Haruka: I'll do anything you ask me to. But you have nothing to worry about. I think you're beautiful, Park-san.

Park: Thank you. I see you've mastered the art of flattery.

Haruka: I really mean it!

Park: He promised he'd come to your concert in Tokyo. I'll ask you again as it gets closer. That fountain pen will be proof that I sent you. In other words, it's your key to meeting up with him.

Haruka: …I'll do it.

Park: Thank you, Haruka.

[The taxi arrives near Haruka’s apartment.]

Haruka: I really enjoyed our night out. Be safe getting home, okay?

Haruka: Same to you, ma'am. Good night!

[The taxi drives away. Haruka gets home.]

Haruka: (Maybe I should get some sleep.)

Haruka: Good night.

[The next morning. Haruka’s cell is ringing.]

Horie: Hello, Haruka-chan?

Haruka: Horie-san? It's so early. Is something wrong! 

Horie: Oh, Haruka-chan, it's horrible! You gotta come down to the office right away!

Haruka: What? What happened!?

Horie: Well… I don't know how to tell you this… Look, just get over here!

[He hung up.]

Haruka: (What could've happened? I'd better get to the office quickly!)

[Heruka runs to the office. She notices that there are a lot of people gathered around. She walks up to the policeman.]

Haruka: Excuse me… What happened here!?

Osaka Policeman: Move along! We need to keep this area clear!

Haruka: But I'm one of the talents here!

Osaka Policeman: By “here” you mean Dyna Chair?

Haruka: Yes, that's right.

Osaka Policeman: I see. Well, there's been a suicide here. Jumped off the roof, apparently…

Haruka: !

Osaka Policeman: I'm sorry… It was the Dyna Chair president.

Haruka: No…

[She runs past the policeman.]

Osaka Policeman: Hey, wait!

Osaka Detective: Did Park-san give any indication she was planning to commit suicide?

Horie: Not at all. One of our talents was just about to make her big debut, so she was under some stress… But I never thought she'd do anything like this.

Haruka: Horie-san!

Horie: Haruka-chan…

Osaka Detective: Who's this?

Horie: This is Haruka Sawamura. She's a talent of ours. Park-san was going to Tokyo today to make arrangements for Haruka's debut event.

Osaka Detective: I see. I’ve got some questions for you later, if you don't mind.

Haruka: Where's Park-san!?

[She runs toward the direction he nods.]

Horie: Haruka-chan! Wait!

[Haruka runs into the alley. Two paramedics carry a corpse on a stretcher, covered with a white sheet. A large bloodstain is left on the pavement.]

Haruka: No… It can't be. She would never! Not Park-san. Park-san…

[The brooch that Haruka had given to Park is still lying on the pavement… Meanwhile, the long-haired man in the crimson jacket is walking down the street. He is carrying a heavy yellow bag.]

Akiyama: Man, it's chilly!

PART 3 SECOND HALF - SHUN AKIYAMA & HARUKA SAWAMURA
Chapter 3: CLOSING IN
[Akiyama walks into his new office, which is apparently still under construction, with a yellow bag in his hands. The bag contains groceries. He rakes through the garbage on the table to put the bag on it. He takes a pack of cigarettes out of the bag, smokes one, and reclines on the couch. His phone starts ringing. It’s his secretary, Hana.]

Akiyama: Uh... Hello?

Hana: (screams) There you are, Chief! Where the heck were you!? I've been trying to reach you all night!

Akiyama: Oh, Hana-chan. Yeah. Sorry about that. I lost track of time, and, before I knew it the sun was coming up.

Hana: Lost track of time? You were out drinking all night again, weren't you!? You said yesterday you'd be back in Tokyo by the end of the day! I was up all night at the office waiting!

Akiyama: Oh. Sorry about that.

Hana: So? How's it going over there, anyway?

Akiyama: Oh, the new Sotenbori branch? Should be opening any day now! I've got phones installed and a sign out front and everything! No need to worry, Hana-chan, I'm on it.

Hana: I’m sure. After all, you've only been going to Osaka every month for the last two years to get it ready… I’m sure by now it's a modern marvel, a real sight to behold!

Akiyama: That sarcasm I'm hearing?

Hana: You think? Chief, if you were really serious about opening that branch, you'd have done it in less than a month.

[Someone knocks at the door.]

Akiyama: Ah, sorry. Hana-chan. Somebody's at the door. I’ll call you right back.

Hana: Somebody's at the door? Who would be visiting you this early in the morning?

Akiyama: Beats me… 

Hana: Oh, really? You're just trying to get rid of me! If you think—

Akiyama: Sorry! Call you back! Bye, now!

Hana: Chief! Wait—

[He hangs up and five men who look like yakuza enter the room.]

Hakamada: So ya finally decided to show up, eh, Sky Finance-han? We stopped by about a million times, but you were always out. Thought maybe you got cold feet or somethin'.

Akiyama: Well, I'm afraid we haven't had our grand opening yet, so if you could just come back another time...

Hakamada: Didn't ya hear? If you're tryna start a business in our neck of the woods, you gotta take it up with us first.

Akiyama: And you are…?

Hakamada: Omi Alliance. Name's Hakamada. 

Akiyama: Omi Alliance…

Hakamada: Glad we got that straightened out.

Akiyama: Now, what can I do for you boys?

Hakamada: A little bird told me you lend any amount of money, indefinitely, no interest charged.

Akiyama: ……

Hakamada: So how's about loanin' us a trillion yen?

Akiyama: Ah, I get it. Well, I'm sorry to say you've wasted your time this morning. I'm pretty busy right now, so I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.

[Hakamada punches one of the boxes near the wall.]

Hakamada: Cut the crap, jackoff!

Akiyama: Man, I hadn't even torn the seal off those bad boys yet!

Hakamada: Keep jerkin' us around, n' that won't be the only thing we're tearin' today!

Akiyama: Now that you mention it. I think I'm the one getting jerked around.

Hakamada: Oh yeah?

Akiyama: You're after protection money, right? Would it kill you to just say so? This is no way to negotiate. The whole “wreck my office at the crack of dawn” routine's kinda pissing me off.

Hakamada: You tryin' to pick a fight with us, pal?

Akiyama: Says the guy breaking my stuff. Be glad to give you a workout, though.

Hakamada: If ya say so, tough guy!

[Akiyama kicks their asses pretty quickly.]

Hakamada: All right. We're gonna let ya off easy this time, but don't think we'll forget this!

[The yakuza leave.]

Akiyama: Man... You mean I have to clean all this up? Huh?

[His phone rings.]

Akiyama: Hello?

Hana: Oh, good! You answered! Chief, I'm afraid I have bad news…

Akiyama: Huh?

Hana: I just got a call from Horie-san at Dyna Chair. The president, Park-san, committed suicide last night…



Akiyama: You're kidding.

Hana: He wants to talk about the money Park-san borrowed from us. And I kinda went ahead and told him you were in town...

Akiyama: Yeah. That's fine. I'll go see him right now. Talk to you later.

Head for Dyna Chair
[Akiyama runs to Haruka’s agency. Before entering the building he hesitates a little.]

Akiyama: ……

[He walks into the lobby and sees Horie sitting at his computer in a depressed state.]

Akiyama: Horie-chan.

[Horie notices Akiyama and runs up to him.]

Horie: Akiyama-san! You startled me. I only just heard from Hana that you were down here in Osaka. I never thought we'd be seeing each other so soon.

Akiyama: And they're certain it was a suicide?

Horie: There was a note. Sounds like the police will have it back to us pretty soon. The handwriting's being evaluated. As far as I could tell, though, it was her writing. Given that, the police are pretty sure it's suicide.

Akiyama: I see... So she left a note, huh?

Horie: The detective said that, lately, suicides are on the rise among executives of smaller companies. He sees it all the time, apparently.

Akiyama: Yeah, you do hear about that kind of thing a lot, I guess...

Horie: Yeah.

Akiyama: So what did her note say?

Horie: It was really short. Just two sentences. All she wrote was, “I’m tired. I'm sorry.”

Akiyama: “I’m tired. I'm sorry.” That's it? That doesn't sound like her.

Horie: I thought the same thing.

Akiyama: What do you think happened to her?

Horie: To be honest, I don't really know. From a business standpoint, she had a lot of enemies, but, as far as I know, none of that was enough to make her wanna kill herself. But there's one more very serious problem I wanted to talk to ya about…

Akiyama: What's that?

Horie: It's about the money Park-san borrowed from you. I looked in the safe earlier to check on it, and it wasn't there anymore.

Akiyama: So you think it was stolen? And the person who took it murdered Park-san?

Horie: Well, I can't say for sure, of course. There's always the possibility Park-san moved it somewhere recently. If I could find the account book Park-san kept, I might be able to tell you something, but it hasn't turned up yet. Still, I wanted to let you know there's a chance the money's been stolen. If that's the case, quite honestly, I don't see how we could ever pay you back.

Akiyama: Oh, of course not. I'd never ask you to pay. I lent the money to Park-san personally, after all, not to Dyna Chair.

Horie: Yes, I know, but still It's such a large sum of money...

Akiyama: Anyway, now that all this has happened, what's the agency going to do?

Horie: I don't know... Park-san always ran everything herself, I really can't imagine what we'll do without her. But there's this one new girl Park-san had been pouring all her energy into. She's just about to make her big debut.

Akiyama: A new girl, huh?

Horie: Yeah, she has great promise. A real gem, this girl. Park-san went all the way to Okinawa to find her. Park-san put so much time and effort into nurturing her. If the agency were to close now, all of that would go to waste. I know Park-san would've hated that.

Akiyama: Horie-chan, it sounds to me like you don't think she committed suicide.

Horie: You better believe I don't. The Park-san I knew never would've done that.

Akiyama: I have to say. I agree with you.

Horie: What about you, Akiyama-san? What are your plans after this?

Akiyama: I plan to do some poking around on my own. I am a moneylender, after all. Wouldn't be very good at my job if I didn't keep track of my loans. If somebody did kill her and took the money… Then I’ll just have to get it back. And with what you told me, I doubt we can count on the police helping out. If I really want to find out the truth behind her death then I guess I'll just have to do it myself.

Horie: Akiyama-san...

Akiyama: So who was the last person to see Park-san alive?

Horie: The new girl I told you about earlier. She's in the studio on the fourth floor right now. I’ll show you the way up.

Akiyama: Nah, that's all right. I’ll figure it out.

[He goes to the training room. It’s dark in there. Haruka sits on the floor near the window buried in her own unhappy thoughts.]

Akiyama: Hey there. Mind if I come in?

[Haruka stays silent.]

Akiyama: I, uh... I heard you were the last person to see Park-san yesterday. I'd like to chat, if you don't mind. Though I'm sure you're not really up for talking after what happened.

[Haruka wipes her tears and turns to Akiyama.]

Akiyama: Wait. Haruka-chan? Shouldn't you be with Kiryu-san?

Haruka: Akiyama-san?

Akiyama: Hold on a sec. You're the new girl Park-san was raving about? I guess Horie-chan did mention Okinawa… Talk about a small world.

Haruka: I don't get it. Akiyama-san. What are you doing here?

[He sits right next to Haruka.]

Akiyama: Truth of it is, I loaned Park-san a bit of capital.

Haruka: She borrowed money from you?

Akiyama: Yeah. She apparently looked all over Kansai, but not a single lender would bite. Then she heard about a shop up in Kamurocho that’ll loan any amount, no collateral. So she went to Tokyo.That shop was Sky Finance. It's, uh, my company. This was a smidge over a year ago.

Haruka: I didn't realize she had money problems.

Akiyama: Oh, I wouldn't call them problems. It's not like Park-san was busking out on the street for a meal or anything. But the amount she wanted… It was intense.

Haruka: How much was it?

Akiyama: Well, er, just about… 300 mil?

{300 million yen is about $2,2 million.}

Haruka: 300!? That's so much.

Akiyama: Yeah. And now, it sounds like that money's vanished into thin air. I was just gonna start looking into it.

Haruka: Do you think… Park-san committed suicide because of the missing money?

Akiyama: It's not impossible. But if you ask me, there's just no way.

Haruka: Why's that?

Akiyama: Well you see, I have a pretty strict loan policy. I put my potential clients through the wringer, just to find out who it is I'm dealing with. Basically my own special screening process. If a client can't pass my test, they don't get their loan. Park-san came all the way from Sotenbori just to see me. And she passed my test with flying colors. When people come knocking on my door, it's usually 'cause they're going through a little rough patch.

[Judging from the video, Akiyama also made her work as a hostess!]

Akiyama: They don't mind begging for a quick fix, but they won't risk their lives for it. Not that I blame them. But Park-san was unbending.

[She also works as a construction site worker.]

Akiyama: She would've fought off an entire army if it meant achieving her dream.

Haruka: Her dream?

Akiyama: Yup. That's right. She didn't come to me just for money. She came to get the means to chase her dream. It was the first time I'd ever found someone so sincerely deserving of the loans I give out. It's almost like that money rained from the sky for her.

Haruka: From the sky...?

Akiyama: Huh? Oh, don't worry about that. It's not important. My point is, Park-san had a dream. That, and an iron will that pushed her through everything I threw at her. Not once did she give up hope. So trust me. Mirei Park was a strong woman. One who'd never take her own life.

Haruka: I agree.

Akiyama: You were the last person to see Park-san yesterday. So if there was anything you noticed… I need you to tell me.

Haruka: Akiyama-san. There's no way Park-san committed suicide. If I had to guess, I'd say… She was murdered. That's the only thing that makes sense. So please… Please let me investigate with you! I’m begging you, Akiyama-san. Take me along. I need to know the truth. I need to see it for myself! Let me come with you!

Akiyama: You've gotta be kidding. And, uh... just to be sure. If the answer was no, would you be a good girl and listen? Yeah, didn't think so. Guess when push comes to shove, I wouldn't expect anything else from Kiryu-san's daughter.

Haruka: Good.

Akiyama: Now, let's see. Where to start? If we want to prove that it was a murder, we'd better have a look at the scene. Although, that might be hard for you, Haruka-chan.

Haruka: I’ll be all right.

Akiyama: Okay. Good on you for keeping your chin up... Now, where do they think she jumped from?

Haruka: From the roof of this building. It's the fifth floor.

Akiyama: Okay, let's head on up and see what we can learn.

[They go to the roof and find Yamauta there standing and smoking.]

Akiyama: Hello.

Yamauta: Who're you?

Haruka: This is Akiyama-san from Sky Finance in Tokyo. Horie-san asked him to come discuss Park-san.

Yamaura: He did, huh...? I see.

Haruka: Akiyama-san, this is Yamaura-san. She works at the agency. She's my vocal coach, too.

Akiyama: Howdy.

Yamaura: Howdy... Listen. Haruka. If ya want a voice lesson, you can come to the studio. Christina is here, too. We gotta do something to distract ourselves at a time like this, right? I'll see ya later.

[She sounds like her spirit was crushed hard. She slowly walks from the exit to the ladder she’s standing.]

Akiyama: So this is where it happened, huh...?

About what time did Park-san die? ✓
Where did she jump from?
How far down is it, anyway?

Akiyama: Haruka-chan, about what time did the incident happen?

Haruka: This morning at about six. People in the neighborhood heard the impact.

Akiyama: I see. (What else do I need to know?)

About what time did Park-san die? 
Where did she jump from? ✓
How far down is it, anyway?

Akiyama: I wonder where she was supposed to have jumped from...

Haruka: Akiyama-san... They say this is where she jumped.

Akiyama: Hmm. Seems like a good spot to fabricate a suicide, if you ask me. What about that shoe thing people sometimes do when they commit suicide? Were her shoes taken off and left neatly on the spot?

Haruka: Yes, apparently so.

Akiyama: Hmm. Very textbook. A practically model suicide. Somehow, that doesn't really seem like Park-san, either. If you ask me, this whole thing reeks.

Haruka: I agree.

Akiyama: (What else do I need to know?)

About what time did Park-san die? 
Where did she jump from? 
How far down is it, anyway? ✓

Akiyama: How far down is it from here? Hmm. At this height, there's no guarantee. You'd have to try and fall head first. If you landed feet first, you might end up with some compound fractures, but you'd definitely pull through. And on a busy street like this, wouldn't you worry about maybe hurting somebody else? Wouldn't you pick a better spot if you were going to jump?

Haruka: Yes, I think you might be right.

Akiyama: If it were me, I'd pick someplace higher, where I could be sure I'd die instantly.

Akiyama: (What else do I need to know?)

About what time did Park-san die?
Where did she jump from?
How far down is it, anyway?
I guess that's about it. ✓

Akiyama: I guess that's about all we're gonna find out from this place.

Haruka: You've seen enough, Akiyama-san?

Akiyama: Yeah. But I don't see any definite proof of a faked suicide. Wanna head back down?

Haruka: All right…

[They go to the office to talk to Horie.]

Akiyama: Sorry to spring this on you, but it looks like Haruka-chan will be coming with me. The two of us are going to look into whether or not it was really suicide.

Horie: What? Why Haruka-chan!?

Akiyama: Well, to tell the truth, this isn't the first time Haruka and I have crossed paths. I never dreamed she was here at Park-san's agency. I could barely believe my eyes when I saw her.

Horie: I see. Small world. And, well, with what's happened and all… I guess this is no time for her to be thinkin' about the Princess League, anyway.

Akiyama: The Princess League?

Horie: Oh, yeah. It's an audition-style music competition put on by an Osaka TV station. The way the show works is… A big record company promises a major debut to whoever can win their way through the tournament. Haruka-chan's right in the middle of competing in the finals.

Akiyama: She made it to the finals? That's incredible! I mean, isn't it?

Horie: It is! It really is! She's a talented girl. Park-san was absolutely set on having Haruka-chan win… And then puttin' on a major concert in Tokyo for her debut.

Akiyama: But there's no guarantee she'll win!

Horie: Right. But that's how much Park-san was willin' to bet on Haruka-chan and her abilities. But I guess Haruka-chan really shouldn't be appearin' on the show now that Park-san is gone. She probably should hold off on that kind of thing for the time being.

Akiyama: No way. She has to go on. No matter what.

Haruka: What?

Horie: Why do you say that?

Akiyama: Because that was Park-san's dream. Haruka-chan, remember how I told you Park-san came to borrow money from me?

Haruka: Yes.

Akiyama: Well, that 300 million yen she borrowed… That was a fund to produce a concert in Tokyo.

Horie: Really? You sure about that!?

Akiyama: Positive. Well, probably not the whole 300 million. Some of that was likely for other promotional activities in Tokyo, but that's beside the point. She came to borrow money from me because she was that confident Haruka-chan would win.

Horie: But, if I remember right, Park-san borrowed that money from you—

Akiyama: A year and a half ago.

Horie: Then, that means—

Akiyama: Exactly. She made up her mind the instant she met Haruka-chan. She was going to see to it that Haruka-chan had that concert in Tokyo, no matter what.

Akiyama: Of course, at the time. I had no idea the money was for you, Haruka-chan...

Haruka: Park-san did all of that... for me?

Akiyama: That's why you can't just give up on her dream. If you don't keep her dream alive, all her efforts will have been in vain.

Horie: ……

Haruka: ……

Akiyama: Haruka-chan, I know how you feel about Park-san. So I won't try to stop you from looking into her death with me. But at the same time...

Haruka: I'll do it. I'll do both. Carrying on her dream is every bit as important to me as finding out the truth about her death.

Akiyama: And there you go. There's the girl Park-san and Kiryu-san saw something special in. And you, Horie-chan. We're counting on you. It’ll be your job to make sure our Haruka-chan here gets to that Princess whatever-it-is.

Horie: Yes! I'll make sure! But, to be honest, I'm not sure how, now that the money is gone...

Akiyama: That's why I'm getting that three hundred million back—to make her dream come true. And in order to do that, we need to investigate her death.

Horie: Akiyama-san... All right, I'm in.

Haruka: But how do we go about investigating her death?

Akiyama: I think the key lies in that suicide note.

Haruka: Her note?

Akiyama: If it wasn't a suicide, it means the killer fabricated it. Horie-chan, you said you thought it looked like her handwriting.

Haruka: I saw it, too, but... Ah!

Akiyama: What is it?

Haruka: Come to think of it, Park-san hurt her hand a little while ago. Her right hand. But she said she used to write with her left hand, so she just went back to doing that

Akiyama: Okay, so she would've used her left hand to write that note. Provided she was the one who wrote it, of course.

Haruka: Right.
Akiyama: But if that note is written in the handwriting style of her right hand… Then somebody forged it. And that would mean that her death was only made to look like a suicide—by her killer.

Haruka: Exactly.

Akiyama: I think it's time we took a look at that note for ourselves. (to Horie) You said the police would give it back after the handwriting was evaluated, right?

Horie: That's right. They didn't think it'd take too long.

Akiyama: Okay, we'll wait until then. I probably should do at least a little work for my company… And if there's anything you want to do, Haruka-chan, now would be the time to do it.

Haruka: No, that's all right. nii just wait here. I can't do anything else at a time like this.

Akiyama: Well, this might be your only chance.

Haruka: What?

Akiyama: You have the Princess League finals coming up, right? No way you'll be able to do anything else once that rolls around. So anything you need to do now, you'd better do while you have time to spare.

Haruka: When you put it that way... All right.

Horie: Good. If the police contact me, I'll let you know. You just take it easy.

Haruka: Okay.

Akiyama: Mind if we exchange email addresses?

Haruka: Oh, of course.

Akiyama: Heh. Don't think I've ever gotten an idol's email address before. Must be pretty lucky.

Akiyama: Okay, well, I guess I’ll head back to my office.

Haruka: Okay.

[Akiyama leaves.]

Horie: Well, I can't just wait around here, so I think I’ll go down to the police station. Maybe that'll speed up us getting the evidence back. I’ll probably be back this evenin' at the earliest. You can use this time to do whatever ya need.

Haruka: All right. Thank you, Horie-san.

Horie: Oh, no need to thank me. This is for Dyna Chair’s future.

[He leaves.]

Haruka: (Horie-san will be back this evening. Maybe I should go home and try and get some rest.)

[You can change characters now! Haruka begins to work hard by attending various events. Now she has to cope on her own. She goes to Soten TV to increase her publicity.]

Haruka:Well, thank you for everything! I’ll be seeing you.

Producer: You bet. Thanks for stopping by. See you!

Haruka: (Phew. That does it for making the rounds. I’d better get back to the agency. Oh, that's that comedian who's famous for reading palms, Shuhei Shimada-san. I can't believe it's actually him! They say his readings are scarily accurate. I’ve always wanted to have him read my palm one day.)

Shimada: Huh? isn't that that giri?

Haruka: !!!

Shimada: It is! You're Haruka-chan, aren't you? From the Princess League?

Haruka: (bows) Yes, that's right! I’m Haruka Sawamura. It's very nice to meet you!

Shimada: That's a good, strong greeting! I like it! I'm Shuhei Shimada. I've been watching you on TV.

Haruka: Oh, thank you! I see you on TV all the time, too!

Shimada: Really? That's nice to hear. So you've seen me do my palm readings on celebrities, huh?

Haruka: Yes, and I’ve always wondered what you would say about me.

Shimada: Oh, yeah? Well, now's your chance to find out! Let's have a look.

Haruka: Really!? You wouldn't mind?

Shimada: Of course not. Hold out your hand.

Haruka: All right…

Shimada: Let’s see… 

Haruka: ……

Shimada: Oh, look at that. You have a cross on your heart line, what's called an embroilment mark. That's pretty rare. 

Haruka: What? An embroilment mark? What's that?

Shimada: It means that you often get caught up in the trouble of those around you, even though you yourself haven't done anything wrong. Sound familiar?

Haruka: Yes, incredibly. That's amazing. Your readings really are as accurate as they say! What else does my palm tell you?

Shimada: Let's see. What else? Oh! Would you look at these! This is unusual, too.

Haruka: What is it?

Shimada: Grief lines. They show just how much pain and sadness you've been through. Does that seem accurate?

Haruka: Yes, I'm afraid it does, more than I’d care to admit.

Shimada: Yeah? Well, it's pretty uncommon for someone of your young age to have been through so much already. People with these lines have had some difficult experiences, but on the other hand, they're often big-hearted and kind. Is that you?

Haruka: Oh, I don't know. I guess it isn't really for me to say.

Shimada: Haha, I guess you've got me there. Wait a minute! Look at this!

Haruka: What is it?

Manager: It's just about time to go, Shimada-san!

Shimada: Oh, okay! Thanks.

Haruka: Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to take up your time.

Shimada: No, that's all right. Hey, good luck on the Princess League. I’ve been on a few shows with your opponent, T-Set. They take a lot of pride in their work, don't they? You may have a tough time beating them.

Haruka: Yes. I'm afraid you might be right.

Shimada: To tell the truth, they're the most professional of all the idols I've worked with. They had the show's format and all their lines down pat. They make it look easy, but I can tell they really put in a lot of time and effort behind the scenes.

Haruka: Yes, I agree. Who knows if I even have a shot against them.

Shimada: Aw, don't give up now. You may have been through a lot, but those experiences have made you stronger. To tell the truth, my career as a comedian didn't take off for quite a while. Until then, my life was pretty rough, to say the least. But I believe those experiences made me who I am today. So keep at it, Haruka-chan! Don't give up!

Haruka: All right. I won't!

Shimada: Well, see you!

Haruka: (bows) Thank you, Shimada-san! (Shimada-san is just as nice in person as he seems on TV. So T-Set is very serious and professional, huh? I bet they've put in incredible amounts of effort. If I want any shot at all of beating them, I'll have to put in even more hard work than they do!)

[She go to a pre-meeting.]

Director: Well, that just about wraps it up. Hopefully now you have a g0od understanding of how the show is going to go.

Haruka: Yes. Thank you very much.

Director: All right. We're through here, then. Thank you!

Haruka: (Phew. Okay. That meeting's done. I’d better get back to the agency.)

[A creep walks up to her.]

Man: Hold it right there! Sawamura-chan?

Haruka: Um… yes?

Man: Heheheh, well, aren't you a cute little thing?

Haruka: Huh? I’m sorry, can I help you with something!?

Man: Oh, that's right. I didn't introduce myself, did I? I'm the producer on the informational show, “Campus Festival.” The name's Takami.

Haruka: (bows) Oh, the producer? My apologies if I was rude. Yes, I'm Haruka Sawamura of Dyna Chair.

Takami: Sure! I know who you are. I never miss an episode of the Princess League! I've been rooting for you since the beginning, you know.

Haruka: Oh, you have? Thank you very much.

Takami: If I may say, you're even cuter in person than you are on TV.

Haruka: Really?

Takami: Absolutely! Yeah, I think you're just great. Say, how'd you like to be on my show?

Haruka: Huh? Really?

Takami: Yeah, sure! After all, I have the final word on who gets to be on the show.

Haruka: (bows) Oh, well, thank you very much!

Takami: Heheh. There's just one thing, though.

Haruka: Hm?

[The creep grabs her hand.]

Haruka: ?!

Takami: And I think you know what I mean.

Haruka: What are you talking about!?

Takami: Don't pretend to be so naive. You know the drill, right? I put you on my show, and you keep me company for a night. A little business deal.

Haruka: You're talking about sleeping my way up the ladder!?

[She continues struggling.]

Takami: Hey, keep your voice down! And don't act so shocked. Surely you've done something like this at least a time or two.

Haruka: I most certainly have not! Let go of me!

Takami: C’mon. What have you got to lose? It could be a great opportunity for you!

Woman's Voice: Hey, what do you think you're doing!?

[Azusa approaches them. The creep let Haruka’s arm.]

Takami: Damn. Who asked you to poke your nose in?

[Azusa looks at him with a look full of anger and contempt.]

Takami: Hmph. Forget it, then. I thought this girl would recognize a good business opportunity when she saw one, but I guess I was wrong. Well, good luck with your “career.” I think you're going to find it's harder getting up that ladder than you thought.

[The creep leaves.]

Azusa: Are you all right? Did he hurt you?

Haruka: I'm fine. He just grabbed my wrist.

Azusa: That Takami guy is infamous for trying to swoop up young girls like that. You weren't going to go along with it, were you?

Haruka: No, of course not!

Azusa: Good. I’d hate to think our opponent was doing anything like that to get ahead. Well, I’d better get going.

Haruka: Wait!

Azusa: Yeah?

Haruka: Thank you! Thank you for saving me.

Azusa: Look, I wasn't trying to rescue you or anything. It's just I hate that crap Takami tries to pull. He tried the same thing with me once, too. Of course, I didn't go along with it, either. I just can't stand to see him up to his old tricks. Anyway, you'd better watch yourself. You're too trusting. Not everybody in the world is so nice, you know.

Haruka: Thank you. I’ll be careful.

Azusa: Glad to hear it. Oh, and keep what I told you between us, you hear? I can't have you telling Mai or Nakai-san.

Haruka: Huh? Oh, all right…

Azusa: Looking forward to going up against you again. See you!

Haruka: (Wow, T-Set's Azusa-san rescued me. I think she must be a good person at heart.)

[She goes to rehearsal for the Princess League.]

Dolce Kamiya: Well, that's it for rehearsal. Do you have any questions?

Haruka: (bows) No, no questions. I'm looking forward to the show.

Dolce Kamiya: Yes, me, too! I must say, Haruka-chan, I'm very impressed. It's amazing how far up you've come in such a short time. I've been the Princess League host for a long time, but not many have had the momentum you've had. You must be practicing twice as hard as everyone else.

Haruka: Oh, I don't know about that. I can't compare myself to others. All I know is that I’m doing the best I can.

Dolce Kamiya: Heheh, good for you! I love your attitude. Girls like you are what make the show great and make it shine. If you want to know why I've hosted the show for so long and it's continued to be so popular, it's that right there. We're all captivated by people like you.

Haruka: Captivated?

Dolce Kamiya: Yes, captivated by the fascinating spectacle of yo beautiful young ladies giving your absolute all to make your dreams come true. It's mesmerizing to watch you hone your skills and vie against one another, sometimes winning, sometimes losing. Simply put, the performances are always entrancing. Younger girls who watch you on TV are drawn to it, too, and in turn they go on to become the next generation of idols. It's absolutely fascinating, don't you think?

Haruka: Gee, you're very serious about all of this, aren't you? I'm a little surprised, to tell the truth.

Dolce Kamiya: Haha. Sorry about the speech. I guess I'm sort of different from how I appear on TV, huh?

Haruka: Hehe, a little, yes.

Dolce Kamiya: By the way, do you know how long the Princess League has been on the air?

Haruka: No, I'm sorry. I’m afraid I don't.

Dolce Kamiya: Oh, no need to apologize! After all, it's been on since before you were even born. The Princess League first aired about twenty years ago. I'm the third host the show has had.

Haruka: Wow, it's been on that long?

Dolce Kamiya: Pretty surprising, huh? But throughout the years, a lot of big-name idols have gotten their start on this program. That's what kind of legacy and influence the Princess League has. So your being on the show now is really a huge opportunity for you!

Haruka: Yes, you're right.

Dolce Kamiya: When the previous host handed the show over to me, he told me, “The Princess League stage is the hallowed ground of dreams.” He told me it was our duty to provide this important site for girls to pursue their aspirations to become idols. As a complete greenhorn to TV, his words made me realize what a big responsibility I had, and made me value my new work all the more.

Haruka: Dolce-san…

Dolce Kamiya: But you participants in the Princess League have a duty to uphold, as well.

Haruka: We do?

Dolce Kamiya: It's up to you to give the next generation of girls hope that they, too, can follow their dreams as they watch you up on that stage. You see, a dream isn't something you use and toss aside. It's more like a baton in a relay race. You have to pass it on. That's what I believe, anyway. And so, I wish you the very best of luck, Haruka-chan.

Haruka: Thank you, Dolce-san! I'll do my best to pass on my dream!

Dolce Kamiya: Heheh, pardon the lecture. I'm done now. I see you at the show!

Haruka: (Wow. Dolce-san is so much more serious than I ever would have guessed. l have to make sure I’m just as serious and responsible as he is!)

[After working some more and attending various events, Haruka goes home.]

Haruka: (Horie-san said he'd be back from the station in the evening. Maybe I should try to sleep.)

[She goes to bed and meanwhile Akiyama's work day is just beginning!]

Akiyama: (Evening already...?)

[His phone rings.]

Akiyama: Hello?

Haruka: Akiyama-san? This is Haruka.

Akiyama: Hey. Any news?

Haruka: Horie-san should be back from the station by now... I've been calling him, but he won’t answer.

Akiyama: Hmm. Wonder if he ran into any trouble?

Haruka: I wish I could get a hold of him. I'm thinking of going to Dyna Chair to make sure he's all right.

Akiyama: ...Okay, I'll go, too.

Haruka: Oh, good. I didn't really want to go alone. Shall we met at the entrance to Dyna Chair?

Akiyama: Sure, sounds good.

Haruka: Okay, see you soon.

[Akiyma walks out of the office.]

[E-Mail]
To my international friends 
best_friend@...
the world! I have a request for you today. 
Lately I haven't been able to take any of the perfect shots that I long for! 
So I had an idea! I want all of you to upload any perfect shots you take to the image hosting site that I built!

Akiyama: (Who's this email from? I think they sent it to the wrong guy. Well, I'll look into it when I get a chance.)

[He goes to the Dyna Chair.]

Haruka: Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: Sorry. Did I keep you waiting long?

Haruka: No, I just got here myself. I tried calling Horie-san again, but still no answer...

Akiyama: Huh. Well, that's all right. Let's go see for ourselves if the note's been returned yet. 

[They go to the office.]

Akiyama: Where do you think Park-san's note might be?

Haruka: In Park-san's office, if the police have returned it. They've been putting her things in a tray there.

Akiyama: Hmm... It doesn't look like Horie-chan's back yet.

Haruka: No, it doesn't...

[They go to Park-san’s office.]

Haruka: Oh, look! Here it is.

Akiyama: So this is the infamous note? Now, if we could just find some of her left-handed writing to compare it to. See anything?

Haruka: Come to think of it, she wrote Horie-san a memo just before she died, and she used her left hand. I bet it's still around here somewhere.

Akiyama: Hey, how about that safe? …It’s locked.

Haruka: You're going to open it?

Akiyama: What an oddiy-shaped keyhole.

Haruka: Huh?

Akiyama: See for yourself. It looks like you could shove a pencil or something in there.

[He tries a random pen from the table.]

Akiyama: Nope, no good. Not that I expected it to work.

Haruka: Wait a minute. Maybe…

[She takes the pen given to her by Park-san out of her pocket.]

Akiyama: What's that?

Haruka: A pen Park-san gave to me before she died. She said it was an early debut present…

[She uses the pen on the safe.]

Haruka: It worked.

Akiyama: Who would've thought? A letter and the account book. So this is where it was.

[This is the same letter Park-san shows Haruka in the taxi. Haruka takes it.]

Haruka: Park-san...

[She puts the letter back. Akiyama drops a piece of paper from the account book he examines.]

Akiyama: Whoops. It's a note from the day she died. A list of instructions. Things she wanted done while she was gone.

Haruka: I think that's the one. I saw her writing it to Horie-san.

Akiyama: Meaning she wrote it with her left hand.

[He compares the suicide note with the piece of paper. It is completely different writing.]

Akiyama: They're not even close. Doesn't take a professional to see that.

Haruka: So then...

Akiyama: Yeah. The suicide note looks just like handwriting from her right hand. In other words, unless her injury magically healed overnight… This thing is a fake. Park-san didn't kill herself. She was murdered. And all this is just an elaborate cover up.

Haruka: I knew it.

[Something drops past the window the moment they talk!]

Akiyama: What was that!?

[Someone jump off the same spot on the roof!]

Haruka: What's wrong?

Akiyama: It's a person! Someone fell off the roof!

[Haruka shocked!]

Akiyama: (No, no. I need to get to the emergency stairs.)

[On the emergency stairs he notices someone running down!]

Akiyama: Get back here!

[He runs after the guy.]

Haruka: Akiyama-san!

[Akiyama catches the supposed killer. It’s Ogita!]

Ogita: Who the shit're you!?

Akiyama: I should ask you the same thing.

[He turns to the body on the street. It’s Horie.]

Akiyama: Horie-chan! So it was you. You must be the one who killed Park-san, too!

Ogita: No! It wasn't me! They made me do it, I swear!

Akiyama: Who did?

Ogita: Please, just lemme go! I didn't do anythin' wrong!

Akiyama: Like I'm gonna buy that!

[Ogita pulls out a butterfly knife.]

Ogita: Fine then. Only one way left to go.

Akiyama: Can't say I didn't see that coming.

[He defeats Kan Ogita who uses breakdance-like fighting style similar to Majima’s.]

Akiyama: Me and you can have a long talk later.

[He runs to Horie.]

Akiyama: Hey, Horie-chan! Horie-chan! Talk to me! Horie-chan. Hang tight, I'm calling an ambulance!

[He pulls out his phone and dials 911. Before he can say a word, he spots a big guy in a suit pointing a gun at him.]

Akiyama: Who are you?

Big Guy: Doesn't concern you. Not with where you're going.

[Suddenly a fire extinguisher flies into his thick head. Haruka throws it down the stairs of the second floor.]

Haruka: Akiyama-san!

Akiyama: Eyes forward, asshole!

[He tries to kick the big guy in the head, but he won't even budge.]

Akiyama: The hell are you made of?

[He fights the big guy and eventually wins.]

Akiyama: You're tough. Real tough.

[A battered Ogita waddles to the exit of the alley, holding onto the wall.]

Haruka: Ogita-san…

[He throws a sad look at her but leaves anyway. The big guy picks up his gun.]

Big Guy: (to Akiyama) I'll remember you. You can count on it.

[Haruka runs to the alley.]

Haruka: Horie-san! Horie-san? Horie-san! Why...?

Akiyama: I think that Ogita guy did this to him.

Haruka: Ogita-san!?

Akiyama: First things first, we need to get Horie-chan to a hospital. His life depends on it.
