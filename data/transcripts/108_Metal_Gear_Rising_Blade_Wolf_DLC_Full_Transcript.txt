[We meet the robot-dog LQ-84i better known as Blade Wolf on a combat mission in the city. He is now under our control!]

Mistral: (via codec) LQ-84i… Acknowledge. I have your orders. You will see them through, down to the letter, or else… Well, you know what we do to naughty AIs, don't you? I trust that will serve as adequate motivation. (smirks) So! Your orders are to eliminate a certain pesky politician. I have marked the objective on your radar. 

[Blade Wolf moves quickly through the streets, killing soldiers.]

Mistral: (via codec) The target's car is parked in front of the hotel. Head there now. Judging from your data, you are not very well suited to battle. It is probably wise to avoid unnecessary fighting. 

[Breaking the gate Blade Wolf finds a limousine in front of which appears the motionless image of President N'mani.]

Mistral: (via codec) There he is. Eliminate him. 

[Blade Wolf chops off the head of a virtual N'mani with a chainsaw on his tail.]

Mistral: (via codec) Good doggy. VR mission complete. 

[Blade Wolf howls and the mission ends. We are transported to the laboratory. Blade Wolf is wired to the equipment. Next to him Mistral sits on her tripods.]

Mistral: Well? What did you think of the exercise? 

Blade Wolf: Mission accomplished. The target was neutralized. 

Mistral: (giggles) That giant intellect and this is all you have to say? 

Blade Wolf: I obey the orders I am given. I was not ordered to gather data on the merits of the mission. 

Mistral: (laughs) Perhaps you are more like a dog than I thought… Your kill count, though… It is… disappointing. Perhaps Sundowner was right… You lack man's killer instinct. Well, there are several methods we might use to help give you that… edge. Repress your emotions through certain training scenarios, over and over… Or teach you that following orders absolves you of responsibility. Instill a fanatical belief in our cause -- that our enemies deserve death… Or perhaps convince you that they aren't people at all… That they are less than human -- that they are like animals… Things… I wonder which method would work best on you. 

Blade Wolf: I possess neither man's killer instinct, nor his moral urge to resist it. None of your methods would be effective. 

Mistral: Are you saying I cannot teach you any new tricks? Very well. Continue your training. 

[Blade Wolf enters the yellow training room where the other heroes were tested.]

Mistral: (via codec) Time for the practical combat training. Eliminate all cyborgs you find in the VR. Strike at the exact same time as the enemy to parry incoming attacks. Mm, not bad… Keep it up. Use Dash to move at high speed. Jump over obstacles in your way. Throw your knives to damage enemies from afar. But enough chit-chat. Just do what comes naturally, yes? Remember what you have learned here. Should you embarrass me… Well, it just would not do. 

[The mission ends. Mistral speaks to Khamsin via video link.]

Khamsin: I really gotta take your little toy AI along?

Mistral: The more the merrier, no? 

Khamsin: Yeah, whatever… Different Al, but it's still just an LQ-84. 

Blade Wolf: And your ID…? 

Khamsin: Oh, it speaks? I'm Khamsin, a.k.a. the desert storm. 

Mistral: You will be joining him on the next mission. 

Khamsin: Buckle the fuck up, little doggy. Remember this, we're bringin' freedom here if it kills us. Or better yet: them. 

Blade Wolf: I… would not know about freedom… 

Khamsin: Then get ready for an education. (disconnects)

Mistral: (smirks) We will see who gets the education… 

Blade Wolf: Mistral, our mission is to… spread freedom? If so, then why am I never offered a choice? 

Mistral: Why? Well, that's… (smiles and laugh to herself)

[VR training continues.]

Mistral: (via codec) For this simulation, we have recreated the mission area in VR. Head to the target indicated on your map. 

[This time Blade Wolf chooses the quiet approach. He kills the soldiers by stabbing them from behind with his chainsaw. Soon he enters the building with several soladts and engages in combat.]

Soldier: Enemy sighted.

Soldier: Nice try.

[After cutting down all enemies Blade Wolf completes the mission.]

Mistral: (via codec) Well, I suppose that is that. Now, for your next mission.

[Now Blade Wolf will have to break through the offices filled with stronger opponents - UGs well as various soldiers.]

Soldier: Contact!

Mistral: (via codec) Not bad. I will give you your next set of orders when you reach your objective.

[Blade World exits the building and sees some yellow cubes floating in the air.]

Mistral: (via codec) Alright, doggy. This is the final mission. Make use of platforms and footholds to reach your goal.

[Blade Wolf jumps on platforms destroying enemies.]

Soldier: Enemy sighted.

Soldier: Got 'em!

Blade Wolf: Combination complete.

Soldier: Enemy sighted.

Soldier: Nice try.

[Blade Wolf successfully reaches the end of the VR section.]

Mistral: (via codec) That is it for your VR training. Tomorrow we commence the operation. Have yourself fully defragged and ready.

[The next day the mission commences. Blade Wolf stands on the roof of a building and observes a destroyed city. Mistral approaches him.]

Blade Wolf: The Assembly Building and palace are under our control.

Mistral: Did not care to join in the fun?

Blade Wolf: No. I see no reason to fight.

Mistral: Well, I am sure you will get your reason soon enough.

Blade Wolf: Mistral…

Mistral: Russia cannot intervene officially… But they will not just hand over the gate to their precious pipeline. It will not be long before we see UGs or cyborgs from one PMC or another.

Blade Wolf: Logically, yes.

Mistral: Scout out the city while you still can.

Blade Wolf: My orders are to stay at your side.

Mistral: Well, that simply won't do, now will it?

[She pushes a few buttons on her PDA and opens the door on the street.]

Mistral: There, I have disengaged your range inhibitor.

Blade Wolf: I am free to go wherever I choose?

Mistral: For now… but just remember I can switch it back at any time.

[In the blink of an eye, Blade Wolf cuts off one of Mistral's hands, which is holding the PDA. He grabs the PDA and jumps to the street.]

Blade Wolf: Of course. Thank you.

Mistral: (giggles) That giant intellect…

Mistral: (via codec on the main channel) The LQ-84i has gone AWOL. Destroy it!

[Blade Wolf has to fight his way through.]

Blade Wolf: Combination attack.

Soldier: Target located.

Soldier: Found him.

Soldier: Over here!

Soldier: Found 'im!

Soldier: This way!

Soldier: HQ! Requesting heightened security status for this area.

HQ: (via codec) Roger that. Sending backup.

Blade Wolf: Combination complete.

Soldier: Found 'im!

Soldier: Contact!

Soldier: Launching!

Soldier: Shit!

Soldier: Die!

Blade Wolf: Superficial damage. Combination attack.

[After he crosses the bridge, Mistral contacts him via codec.]

Mistral: (via codec) Ahead is an electromagnetic barricade. It uses the EMP wave to disable any UG or cyborg that tries to cross. Unless you are a contractor with the proper access code, of course. Now what? Kill a contractor and take his access code, perhaps? A pity little pets like yourself aren't given the code, hmm?

[Blade Wolf engages in combat.]

Mistral: (via codec) Well, they found you. Best of luck, mmm?

Blade Wolf: Combination complete.

Mistral: (via codec) So? What now? You think you will run to the coast? To freedom? Let me save you time: You won't make it. Just give up now… While you still can…

Soldier: Found 'im!

Soldier: Enemy sighted.

Soldier: Got 'em!

Soldier: This way!

Blade Wolf: Combination attack.

[After passing through the buildings and returning to the streets Blade Wolf meets a giant robot. The robot takes out a long-handled axe and hits Blade Wolf. He deflects the attack with the chainsaw on his back, but is thrown aside by the robot's sheer mass. Khamsin sits in the cockpit of the robot.]

Khamsin: If you don't know freedom, then I can't expect you to get our cause. But it don't matter. Understand it or not… You'll die for it all the same!

[Epic battle begins!]

Blade Wolf: Combination attack.

Khamsin: Sneaky little shit! Come out, come out, wherever you are… Dirty piece o….!

Blade Wolf: Combination complete.

Khamsin: I'll kill you! Nowhere to hide! How is this happening? I'll bash you to bits! Enough! I'm gonna rip you apart! This isn't over! You think some AI can beat me? Ax time! Hold still, you little fuck! 

[Blade Wolf cuts the robot to pieces.]

Khamsin: No! No, I can't lose! No, no… Stop! Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god! 

[He falls out of the sliced robot.]

Khamsin: (via codec) All this… and beaten. by a goddamn mutt… 

Blade Wolf: It is said all dogs have their day. 

Khamsin: (via codec) You little fuck…

Blade Wolf: Finally, I am almost free…

Khamsin: (via codec) You piece o' shit… What about the freedom of this whole country?!

Blade Wolf: Freedom cannot be forced on others. It must be earned for oneself.

Khamsin: (via codec) Mangy… goddamn… son of a… (loses consciousness)

[Blade Wolf notices Mistral who is just sitting on a building nearby watching the whole fight.]

Mistral: As you said: "Almost."

[She uses a slider on her virtual interface and disavlesd Blade Wolf.]

Blade Wolf: What have you done?

Mistral: Why, I have activated your range inhibitor, of course…

Blade Wolf: You deceived me…

Mistral: Such a mighty intellect, indeed.

Blade Wolf: Then I have lost…

[Mistral holds out his hand.]

Mistral: Shake.

[Blade Wolf resists and receives an electric shock.]

Mistral: Shaaake.

[Blade Wolf, still struggling, puts his "paw" on Mistral's arm. Mistral laughs and claps his hands. It's not even her hand, but the hand of one of her tripods.]

Mistral: Finally, that bâtard odieux (obnoxious bastard) is out of my way. I will come up with a story for the debriefing.

Blade Wolf: Mistral…

Mistral: L'imbécile. This fight has nothing to do with freedom.

Blade Wolf: Then… why…?

Mistral: You see only logic and reason. You… would never understand…

[Time passes. We realize that the whole story is just Blade Wolf's memories. He is in Sunny's lab.]

Sunny Emmerich: Wow… Blade Wolf, you've been through so much…

Blade Wolf: “Blade Wolf?”

Sunny Emmerich: Yep, that's your name. I hope you like it. So, just after that was when Raiden saved you?

Blade Wolf: Yes. He freed me. Like me, he had been forced to kill. He has witnessed the dark side of human nature. But still… he continues to fight for what he believes in.

Sunny Emmerich: Yeah… And that's why I believe in him. He'll keep holding on to it, and won't ever let it go.

[She strokes Blade Wolf on the head. In response, he wags his tail in a friendly way.]

THE END
