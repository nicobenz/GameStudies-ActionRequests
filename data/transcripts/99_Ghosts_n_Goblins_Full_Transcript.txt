Night. A brave knight named Sir Arthur with a thick red beard and his beautiful beloved Princess Guinevere with purple hair are resting in a gloomy cemetery. The knight's armor is lying nearby, and the knight himself is sitting in just his underpants, which hints at a possible intimate relationship between them. In the distance in the mountains we can see the blue roof of some castle. Suddenly a creepy winged creature, a red demon, appears. It grabs the beautiful beloved of our knight and disappears with her. Without any hesitation, the knight puts on his armor, puts his trusty spear in his hands and sets out to the rescue.

LEVEL 1 - CEMETERY
While walking through the cemetery Sir Arthur has to fight a lot of zombies. They crawl out of the ground right under his feet, hoping to eat fresh brains, but only get a spear in the eye.
Next, Forest Ghosts get in the way of the knight. They make creepy, disgusting squeaks and always fly higher than our hero. Waiting for them to descend below Sir Arthur aptly throws his spear and kills them. 
Soon he reaches an ancient building with a massive iron door. They are guarded by an ogre with a huge horn on his forehead, which is why he is known as the "Unicorn". The knight realizes that there's no point in fighting hand to hand or the strong monster would simply break his whole body, so he throws his spear several times from a safe distance and eventually wins! After defeating the Unicorn, Sir Arthur gets the key to the door.

LEVEL 2 - ANCIENT CASTLE RUINS
Sir Arthur finds himself in an ancient castle. Its front part is ruined and partially flooded, so he has to jump over the remnants of floors and ceilings. And all this might seem like a simple task if it weren't for the little Blue Demons flying everywhere! Deftly dodging them, Sir Arthur accidentally steps on the sagging part of the ceiling, which falls down with a crackle, but our knight manages to make a jump and find himself on solid ground.
He walks past the half-destroyed wall and comes to the surviving part of the buildings. Crows are flying around, and ghosts are flying out of the windows of the dilapidated houses, where the servants lived. Considering that the castle itself has undergone much greater destruction I can assume that once upon a time long ago there was a revolt of servants against their cruel masters.
After defeating the crows Arthur enters one of the houses and realizes that he is trapped. The house is inhabited by small ogres, and thanks to the huge holes in the walls crows fly in every now and then. The way through these hordes is not easy. Arthur climbs ladders, dodges crows, and tries to defeat the ogres as quickly as possible. Eventually, after a heated battle, he manages to get out of this cursed house.
After that, our knight has to overcome the flooded parts of the city. He uses the protruding parts of the houses, overcomes the obstacle and gets out of the ruined castle.  He emerges to the entrance of a massive cave, guarded, however, by... two Unicorns! Sir Arthur decides to act tactically. He separates the enemies and kills them one by one. Taking the key to the cave, Sir Arthur enters its dark vaults…

LEVEL 3 - THE CAVES
The cave inside turns out to be quite narrow. From its ceiling hangs a drift of stalactites, some of which, because of vibrations or cracks, can not stand and fall on the head of our knight. In addition, the cave is full of... zombies. Perhaps the cruel masters of the castle nearby have arranged here a kind of cemetery. And, of course, there are bats. A lot of them.
Fighting this evil, Sir Arthur finds an old battle axe. It is not very big and is easy to throw. With it, Arthur blows his way to secret rooms lined with stone. I think this is the secret laboratory of the castle masters. Here they conducted various diabolical experiments on people and used magic.
Upon reaching the opposite entrance to the laboratory, Sir Arthur meets... a dragon. But not the usual winged one that we are used to, but a Chinese one. It floats through the air and strives to devour our knight in one bite. Dodging his attacks, Sir Arthur cuts off the dragon's tail and it dies. After taking the key, Sir Arthur leaves the laboratory.

LEVEL 4 - OVER THE ABYSS
Once out of the lab, Sir Arthur sees that there is a vast abyss in front of him and there is no way to continue his journey. He sits there for a while, pondering his options, until he notices that the smoke coming out of the lab is very dense.  The smoke turns out to be magical and you can even stand on it! With no other options, our brave knight decides to take advantage of his find... He jumps from cloud to cloud until he hits solid ground, where he is met by... The Red Arremer. This small but very fast red demon with white wings dives at Sir Arthur, inflicting severe damage on him and quickly flies away, but on his next run Sir Arthur splits his skull in two with his axe.
Next, our brave knight finds himself on a long bridge. Little Blue Demons fly everywhere, and pillars of flame erupt from the fiery lava under the bridge. Defeating this carnival of death costs Sir Arthur his armor. You can go no further... Without his armor, Sir Arthur will die in the first battle. However, after a bit of wandering, he finds the corpse of someone poor in armor! He was able to walk across the bridge, but died because of his wounds from the battle. Sir Arthur silently thanks the dead man and takes his armor. Ready for battle our knight goes out to fight the two dragons and defeats them.

LEVEL 5 - LOWER PART OF THE CASTLE
And so Sir Arthur finds himself in the lower part of the castle of the kidnapper of his beloved princess, the blue roof of which could still be seen in the cemetery. Here he is met by a host of enemies he has already encountered. After a grueling battle Sir Arthur climbs several floors, defeats the dangerous Red Arremer and ascends to the upper part of the castle.

LEVEL 6 - UPPER PART OF THE CASTLE
This is it. The stakes are high and the enemies are more numerous than ever. Unicorns walk the corridors, Dragons fly newar the ladders, Red Arremer is on practically every floor, and there are no ordinary enemies like Blue Demons to speak of. In the heat of battle, Sir Arthur finds a strange shield with a cross on it. The shield shines a mystical light and Arthur decides to take it with him. Upon reaching the top of the castle Sir Arthur encounters... with Satan himself. This huge red demon flies over the castle roof and swoops down to bite the head off our brave knight, but thanks to the strange shield and its mystical power, Sir Arthur manages to win.

FINAL LEVEL - THRONE ROOM
Using Satan's key, Sir Arthur enters the Throne Room. There the kidnapper of his beloved is already waiting for him. His name is Astaroth. The princess herself sits tied up in a corner. Sir Arthur enters the battle. The weapon seems to do Astaroth no harm, but the mystical power of the magic shield can still penetrate his defenses. After Sir Arthur attacks Astaroth ten times, Astaroth dies. An inscription appears on the screen…


THIS ROOM IS AN ILLUSION AND 
IS A TRAP DEVISUT (DEVISED) BY SATAN. 
GO AHEAD DAUNTLESSLY! 
MAKE RAPID PROGRESS!


BACK TO THE CASTLE
After such an encouraging message, the knight is teleported to the beginning, to the Cemetery, and offered to go all the way again, but now the enemies have become faster, stronger and angrier. Having defeated them all, Sir Arthur returns to the throne room and kills Astaroth again.
