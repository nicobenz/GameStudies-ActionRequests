A HANGAR 13 GAME
BASED ON AN ORIGINAL GAME BY ILLUSION SOFTWORKS

Prologue (1938)
[Over the vast, boundless ocean, a few seagulls fly by, giving us a view of the city and a tall white lighthouse not far from it. The waves wash over the rock on which the lighthouse stands. The camera moves on and we see a 1929 Cunningham V-8 mail car driving down a country lane. The car pulls into town.]

[The camera zooms through the city, showing us citizens living peacefully to beautiful and slightly sad music. The opening is very reminiscent of the beginning of a movie and the names of the actors on the screen only amplify this effect.]

DAMEON CLARK AS DETECTIVE NORMAN

[Finally, after three minutes of flying over the city, we descend to the train stopping at a station. A middle-aged man comes out with a folder in his hands. He walks through the streets and enters a diner where a well-dressed man is waiting for him.]

Detective Norman: You Tommy?

Tommy Angelo: Thomas Angelo.

Detective Norman: Detective Norman.

[The detective throws the folder on the table and sits across from Tommy.]

Tommy Angelo: You alone?

Detective Norman: No self-respectin’ badge is comin’ in here. Unless it’s the health inspector.

Waitress: What can I get ya?

Detective Norman: Just the coffee. Thanks. (takes out a flask) Dip your beak?

Tommy Angelo: No thanks.

Detective Norman: Suit yourself. So, you said on the phone you might have a proposition for me?

Tommy Angelo: That’s right.

Detective Norman: Well if you’re looking to set up a gravy train, you called the wrong cop. I’m not lookin’ for any…”associates.”

Tommy Angelo: Good, cause I’m on the nut. Can’t even pay for the coffee. But I got plenty to trade.

Detective Norman: Let’s hear it.

Tommy Angelo: How long you been in town?

Detective Norman: Three years. Cut my teeth in Empire Bay.

Tommy Angelo: An’ they handed you the Morello case, right outta the gate?

Detective Norman: That’s what the paper says, ain’t it? And what’s it to you?

Tommy Angelo: Tough break. Case must be gettin’ pretty cold by now…

Detective Norman: What, you got somethin’ might warm it up?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, I might have somethin’.

Detective Norman: And what’s my end of the deal? You want money? Some sort of immunity?

Tommy Angelo: None of that. I got people I need to protect.

Detective Norman: Ah. Family’s always the Achilles heel, ain’t it? So, who you got? A sick ma? Or a wife and a litter of kids?

Tommy Angelo: Wife and daughter.

Detective Norman: An’ no one else to watch your back, I’m guessin’.

Tommy Angelo: Wouldn’t be here otherwise.

Detective Norman: Pity that. Pa always said a man needs friends if he’s going to survive in this world.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, well, in my world it’s the other way around.

Detective Norman: No surprise there. Look, I can’t promise anything for your family. Not until I hear what you’re tradin’. So, are you talkin’ or are you just killin’ time before they come for you?

Tommy Angelo: You think I’m on the run?

Detective Norman: (laughs) Oh, I know it Tommy. Jesus look at you. You’re surely gassed. You haven’t slept for days, an’ your neck’s gotta be achin’ from all that lookin’ over your shoulder you’re doin’. No, the way I figure it is, you’ve got someone powerful mean on your tail. An’ they ain’t givin’ up until you end up in the river. Now, you walk out that door without me, we both know you’re not makin’ it five steps. But, you stick around, tell me your story, and maybe you got a shot at livin’ long enough to walk that girl of yours down the aisle. Either way looks like I’m buyin’ you a cup of coffee.

Tommy Angelo: Christ, I don’t know how everything got so balled up…

Detective Norman: No one ever sees the hairpin until it’s too late. But, you didn’t get handed a heater in the nursery, did ya?

Tommy Angelo: No. I was a cab driver. Back in ’30…

Chapter 1: An Offer You Can’t Refuse (1930)
[We jump back in time. Night. Tommy's cab stands by the side of the road. Tommy smokes peacefully and inspects his car.]

Tommy Angelo: (offscreen) I mostly drive nights ‘cause the money was better. It was at the end of those shifts when I first met Paulie and Sam…

[Several cars rush through the night city. Paulie and Sam try to get away from the pursuers.]

Paulie: Ah shit!

Sam: Son of a bitch!

Paulie: Watch out!

[They crash into the edge of the stone curb and, breaking through the stone, fall to the level below.]

Sam: Get up Paulie! There’s a taxi here! We’ll be okay! 

[He pulls out a gun and points it at Tommy.]

Sam: Move it! Come on!

Tommy Angelo: Where to?

Paulie: Anywhere. Fast!

[Tommy's cab pulls out onto the road.]

Sam: I got a gun pointed at you! They catch up, we’re dead: but you don’t get to walk away!

Tommy Angelo: I don’t want any trouble!

Sam: Well you got trouble! Drive!

Paulie: How the hell they know we’d be there?

Sam: It doesn’t matter now! We just gotta lose ‘em!

Paulie: How many cars we got following?

Sam: One for now, but there’ll be more.

Tommy Angelo: Hold tight, I’m gonna try something.

[Tommy maneuvers and the pursuers' car crashes into construction materials on the road.]

Paulie: Holy Shit!

Tommy Angelo: Who were those guys?

Sam: You don’t get to ask questions! We need to get over the river! Take the Giuliani Bridge.

Tommy Angelo: Okay.

Sam: Your leg okay up there?

Paulie: Hurts like hell.

Sam: When we’re back I’ll wake up the doc.

Paulie: I don’t know, might be okay.

Sam: He’s getting the call anyways. Hey, I see you listening cabbie. You don’t get to listen either!

Tommy Angelo: All I’m doing is taking you guys where you wanna go.

Sam: So do that.

Tommy Angelo: Okay, we’re at the river, where am I takin’ you once we’re over the bridge?

Sam: I’m getting tired of the questions.

Tommy Angelo: More of them!

Paulie: Shit!

Tommy Angelo: I know some short-cuts that’ll slow them down.

Sam: I don’t care how you do it – just shake them off! 

[Tommy maneuvers again and the chaser's cars crash into the construction materials on the road.]

Sam: That was your short-cut?

Tommy Angelo: I lost them didn’t I?

Paulie: Not all of ‘em.

Tommy Angelo: These guys don’t really like you, do they?

Paulie: Sometimes business partners fall out. It happens.

Sam: Quit yapping Paulie. More he knows, the more chance of him not seein’ the sun come up.

Tommy Angelo: I ain’t heard a thing, fellas.

Sam: You left them in the dirt!

Paulie: We ain’t clear yet! Keep driving! Poor bastards digging the road works program aren’t going to thank us for this.

Sam: Three crates down – how many motors were at the exchange?

Paulie: Four? Five maybe? Knowing him he’s called for more.

Sam: Sure feels like it.

Paulie: Next time, we take more muscle. We should have expected trouble. When the boss hears about this, there'll be hell to pay. You’re one hell of a wheelman, I’ll give you that.

Sam: They must have sent word out. There’s more and more of them. We’re not gonna last long unless we’re back on our own turf. Let’s get back to the neighborhood.

Paulie: West Harbor bridge cabbie. Fast! Uh, the bridge is up, ain’t it?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. We can make it.

Paulie: What the hell are we doing?!

Sam: Just sit tight n’ pray! 

[Tommy flies his cab over the bridge, leaving his pursuers far behind.]

Sam: Never done that before.

Paulie: Me neither.

Sam: Okay, so Little Italy: now. Your night’s not over.

Paulie: I didn’t see this coming. You think he squealed?

Sam: I think you zip it tight. We talk it through back at the bar. Okay we’re close.

[Tommy slows down.]

Paulie: Pull over in front of that bar.

Tommy Angelo: Salieri’s place?

Paulie: Yeah, that’s the one. Wait here.

Tommy Angelo: What for?

Paulie: You want a little something from the Don or not?

[Paulie and Sam, holding each other, waddled into the bar. Tommy stays in the cab and lights a cigarette. A few minutes later, Sam comes out of the bar. He slowly reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out... an envelope.]

Sam: Compensation for your services and any damage to your car. This makes us square.

Tommy Angelo: I’m sure it’s more than enough.

Sam: Good. Don Salieri wants you to know that he is very grateful. So, if you ever need anything, maybe a loan or some honest work, don’t hesitate to ask. The Don doesn’t forget his friends.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, okay, thanks.

Sam: One more thing. This matter stays between us. Anyone asks where you got that money, you won it at poker. And the scratches on your car? You swerved to keep from hitting an little old lady. You got it?

Tommy Angelo: Of course.

Sam: See you around, kid.

[Tommy throws out his cigarette and leaves. He comes home and pours himself a glass of whiskey.]

Tommy Angelo: (offscreen) When I opened the envelope, I could’ve had a heart attack. Enough to fix the cab. Nearly enough to buy a new one. I thought about what Sam had said about work. I wasn’t interested. The money was good, sure, but I didn’t want to get in with criminals. Better to be poor and alive than rich and dead. So right there, back then: I was out.

[Note - a new car in 1930 cost about $600, the equivalent of $10,000 today.]

Chapter 2: Running Man (1930)
[The next morning.]

Tommy Angelo: (offscreen) After that night with Salieri’s guys, I was back working soon as I could. But it felt different. You get a lot of time with your thoughts when you’re a cabbie. And other people’s thoughts too…

[Tommy stands with his cab on the wall of the road, waiting for passengers.]

Passenger 1: You there! Driver!

Tommy Angelo: Yes ma’am?

Passenger 1: Are you driving or loitering?

Tommy Angelo: Driving ma’am. Always driving. 

[They get into a cab.]

Tommy Angelo: So where to?

Passenger 1: St. Michael’s Church. Directly. Careful please.

Tommy Angelo: I always drive careful.

Passenger 1: Then you’d be the first.

Tommy Angelo: So, church? It Sunday already?

Passenger 1: Eyes on the road please. Stop there, by the park.

Tommy Angelo: Here you go. St. Michael’s. That’ll be thirty cents.

Passenger 1: The only tip I’ll give you is to stop smoking in your vehicle. I felt like I was sitting in an ashtray.

Tommy Angelo: Sure. Whatever you say.

[She gets out of Tommy's cab and mutters to herself.]

Passenger 1: These Italians are all the same.

Tommy Angelo: Can’t drive without the radio…Better find a new fare.

Passenger 2: Art Gallery. Get me there quick.

Tommy Angelo: Sure. Quick, I can do. Taking some time out?

Passenger 2: What’s it to you?

Tommy Angelo: Not much. Just… talking.

Passenger 2: I’m paying you to drive, so do that. Look at them out there. The problem with this downturn is that it’s made people lazy. Given them an excuse.

Tommy Angelo: The work’s not out there pal.

Passenger 2: The work is always there. You just have to find it.

[Note - The Great Depression began in the U.S. in the 1930s.]

Tommy Angelo: I get it, you’re a busy guy. I don’t see so many these days.

Passenger 2: I saw this crap-shoot depression coming. Sold up before the crash. So yeah, I get to be busy.

Tommy Angelo: You’re busy day’s gonna be looking at old paintings?

Passenger 2: I have a business meeting with a colleague! Not that it’s anything to do with you. If you ever find a real job, then maybe you’ll understand. Until then, drive and quit bothering me.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, yeah. I get you.

Passenger 2: Pull up in front of the Gallery. Thanks pal. There’s fifty cents, don’t spend it all at once.

Tommy Angelo: I’ll try not to.

[The passenger leaves the cab.]

Tommy Angelo: Every fare today’s been son-of-a-bitch… onto the next…

Passenger 3: Oh boy, you look like shit.

Tommy Angelo: I’ve been working since five, what’s your excuse?

Passenger 3: Booze.

Tommy Angelo: Figures. Where are we going?

Passenger 3: Little Italy. 21st Street.

Tommy Angelo: Okay, if I don’t tell the cops about the liquor on your breath – you don’t tell them when I break the limit. Good deal?

Passenger 3: Great deal. Got any good fares today?

Tommy Angelo: Some. But never enough of ‘em.

Passenger 3: Who’s got the money for cab rides since the market tanked and it all went to shit, I guess. Only reason I’ve got you taking me places is I’m drunk and don’t know better. Cops see enough drunk fellas. They’re only after the people moving it and selling it.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, but I’ve seen them go after guys for less.

Passenger: Guess so. If they think they can shake something out of you, they’ll use any excuse. This city’s corrupt as all hell.

Tommy Angelo: Sure is.

Passenger 3: Nearly there. Just up here on the corner please. Hey, my cousin has a coffee stand around the corner. Tell him Lucio sent you, take a break, huh?

Tommy Angelo: Thanks. Might just do that.

[The drunk passenger gets out of the cab. Tommy decides to take his advice and have a cup of coffee. While he is enjoying his drink, someone smashes his windshield.]

Tommy Angelo: Whoa, Jesus! What the-oh!

Dino: Hey, how you ‘doin, pal? You remember me? Yeah? 

[He throws Tommy out of the cab and kicks him in the stomach while his partner smashes the radiator with the bat.]

Dino: Huh? Mr. Morello’s a little bent. Shouldn’t go helpin’ Salieri’s goons, huh? Now I’m gonna have to give you a beatin’, just so you always remember who runs this town. Make it so you won’t do much walkin’ for a while.

[Tommy pushes Dino away and flees.]

Dino: Look at this guy. I didn’t think he’d make it fun. Let’s get him.

[Tommy runs through yards of alleyways until he comes to the opposite street where Salieri's restorant is located. Paulie and Sam stand at its entrance, drinking coffee and smoking.]

Paulie: Look at this.

Sam: How you ‘doin kid?

[Tommy hides behind their backs.]

Sam: Dino. Lou. You got business with the Don?

Dino: Nah. We’re just trying to talk to that cabbie over there, that’s all.

Sam: That right?

Dino: Yeah.

Sam: Well this here’s the Don’s favorite driver. So anythin’ you gotta say to the him, you can say to me.

Dino: Is that right? Well, let me tell you somethin’ pal. We ain’t leavin’ empty handed, that’s for sure.

[Paulie walks into the restorant and comes out with a shotgun in his hands.]

Paulie: Well then maybe you ain’t leavin’ at all.

Dino: Okay then. See you boys around. Let’s go Lou.

[Dino and Lou leaves. Paulie laughs.]

Tommy Angelo: Thanks.

Sam: Least we could do.

Paulie: C’mon. Let’s go say hi to the Don.

Tommy Angelo: Don Salieri?

Sam: Yeah. He’s gonna wanna hear about this.

[Tommy goes into the restaurant.]

Chapter 3: Molotov Party (1930)
[Tommy and the others walk into a room with a long table. It's Don Salieri's office. A stout-looking man with a cigar in his teeth comes out to them. He looks at Tommy with suspicion. Everyone sits down at the table.]

Don Salieri: What do they call you son?

Tommy Angelo: Thomas. Thomas Angelo, sir.

Don Salieri: Frank told me you ran into some trouble?

Tommy Angelo: Yes sir. My cab got smashed up pretty good.

Paulie: Morello’s thugs went after him, on account of Tommy helping us—

Don Salieri: This, uh, taxi, that your livelihood?

Tommy Angelo: Yes sir.

Don Salieri: I feel a sense of responsibility here. So, I’m going to set you up with a small loan, enough to get that cab of yours fixed up.

Tommy Angelo: I appreciate that, sir, but I’m not looking for a handout.

Don Salieri: Then what are we doing here?

Tommy Angelo: (with a devilish smile) I just want a shot at the bastards who wrecked my cab.

Don Salieri: Hah! You hear that, Frank? The kid wants my permission to get into a fight.

Frank: Yes, I heard.

Don Salieri: Okay, Tommy Angelo. All of Morello’s gorillas hang out at a bar he owns. Paulie, you know the place.

Paulie: Sure do boss.

Don Salieri: Good, you can ride along with Tommy. There’s a lot right next to the bar where they park their cars. Go smash up a few tin cans, send Morello a message. He can’t rough up hard-working Joes in my neighborhood without getting a black eye.

Tommy Angelo: Thank you Mr. Salieri. I won’t let you down.

Don Salieri: And Tommy, when you get back, we’ll talk about what’s next for you.

[Tommy and Paulie leave the room.]

Paulie: No-one else knows you here, so tread careful – okay?

Tommy Angelo: Sure.

Carlo: The boss finished yet?

Paulie: Nah. You got more time to sit on your ass.

Carlo: [sigh] Who’s the new guy?

Paulie: Some cabbie. We’re helping him out.

Carlo: He's gonna drive the boss?

Paulie: Nah, you don't lose your job that easy.

Carlo: I hate sitting around. Boring as hell.

Paulie: If the boss says you’re not ready to come out on collections, hat can you so?

Carlo: I don't get this problem with me Paulie. What do you think I've gotta do to…

Paulie: I think you shouldn’t ask me Carlo. I’m not gonna give a good answer.

LETTER TO SALIERI
Don Salieri,
I am writing to let you know of my joy to hear that you will be attending the wedding of my daughter. Please, if there are any further arrangements you would wish for — let me know.
It will be a wonderful day, and for the world to see that the occasion has your blessing you will make it even more special and memorable.
Your loyal friend,
Giovanni Romano

Paulie: Find anything good?

Tommy Angelo: Nah, I…

Paulie: I’m watchin’ you. Got it?

Tommy Angelo: I get it.

NEWSPAPER - SEPT 23RD 1930
PROHIBITION HERE TO STAY!
PRODUCTION AND SALE OF ALCOHOL TO REMAIN ILLEGAL. In a speech to gathered press, President Herbert Hoover reiterated today that the 'noble experiment' of Prohibition WILL remain in place. Forced to respond to Democrat criticism, Hoover also promised a more efficient and better funded Prohibition Bureau to prevent profiteering and smuggling.

Luigi: Chi e lui? (Who is he?)

Man: II tassista, ricordi? (The taxi driver, remember?)

Luigi: Ah, si, si. (Ah, yes, yes.)

[Tommy wants to go behind the bar.]

Luigi: The bar is closed, for you, I'm afraid. Come back later. With Paulie. Or Sam.

[Tommy goes back to Paulie.]

Paulie: Anyways, I got places to be. Okay, come through this way. I’ll take you to Vinny first. He’s a loudmouth, but Frank and the Don have known him since forever.

Tommy Angelo: What’s he do?

Paulie: We go see him whenever we need to do any, uh, heavy lifting. He makes sure we’re all well-heeled for when there’s trouble.

[Tommy goes out into the courtyard and hears a conversation by a truck.]

Truck Driver: And we're grateful for his dough. But we’ve got to go. Long drive back north.

Little Tony: If the Don wants to do this again, we can meet out of town. Someplace there’s no heat.

Truck Driver: That’d be good. Drove into the city this morning thought I saw cops on every corner. I know a place.

Little Tony: Yeah, we know a bunch of places.

[Tommy climbs the wooden stairs together with Paulie and goes to Vincenzo. He is cleaning his shotgun.]

Paulie: Buon giorno Vincenzo! (Good morning Vincenzo!)

Vinny: Ciao Paulie. (Hi Paulie.) (looks at the shotgun) Oh, she’s gonna sing… (laughs) Who’s this then?

Paulie: Vinny, this here’s Tommy Angelo. We’re doin’ a little job together.

Vinny: Alright, good, good. You need bean shooters or rods?

Paulie: Nah. We just need something to write off a few cars.

Vinny: Oh, I got just the thing. (pulls out a bat) This classic should do the trick. If the bat don’t work out for you, I got a few cocktails here.

[He brings a case of molotov cocktails.]

Paulie: Ay yai yai.

Vinny: Careful with ‘em, though. Don’t want to burn off your short hairs. Good to meet you, Tom. Let me know if Paulie gives you a hard time. I’ll straighten him out.

[Tommy and Paulie go out into the yard.]

Paulie: Ralphie’s in the garage. He’s a special kinda idiot, but he’s got a way with cars. I don’t get how this moron gets engines to purr, but I’m tellin’ you, it’s like some kinda black magic.

[They go into the garage. Paulie gestures to Tommy to keep quiet, еhen he says loudly.]

Paulie: Hey genius!

[Ralph bangs his head on the hood of the car he’s fixing.]

Paulie: Haha! Get your head outta your ass!

[Ralph turns out to be a stutterer.]

Ralphie: The f-fuh-fuck there, Paulie! Y-y-you can’t just sneak up on a guh-guh-guy like that!

Paulie: I’m sorry Ralphie, I’m just bustin’ your balls.

Ralphie: I suh-suh-see you’re still limping. Guess we got t-t-two cripples working here.

[The smile comes off Paulie's face in an instant.]

Paulie: We ain’t nothin’ alike, you got that, Ralph?

Ralphie: Shu-shu-sure, Paulie, yeah.

Tommy Angelo: Tommy. Tommy Angelo.

Ralphie: Guh-guh-good to meet you.

Paulie: Like I said, Ralphie here’s a cracked egg. But bring him a stolen car, he’ll make it yours. Tom and me, we got a job to do, we need some wheels.

Ralphie: How ‘bout this one, Puh-Puh-Paulie. It-it ain’t hut-hot-ruh-rod, but it-it’ll get you across tuh-tuh-town.

Paulie: (to Tommy) Alright, let’s go. You’re drivin’. (to Ralphie, threatening) An’ don’t let me catch you loafin’ off again!

[Tommy and Paulie drive out of the garage.]

Ralphie: One day I’m gonna cut your brake line, asshole…

[Tommy and Paulie ride out into the street.]

Paulie: I don’t know what Ralph’s tryin’ to pull giving us this motor. I want to show you somethin’ about the good life, and you’re drivin’ somethin’ my Ma could’ve bought twenty years ago. If I know Ralph he probably got it taken out of her yard.

Tommy Angelo: The car’s fine – it’s good to get a change from the cab.

Paulie: You don’t have to be nice about it. This thing’s a tin can.

Tommy Angelo: So…was that whiskey back there in the truck?

Paulie: Yeah. New supplier.

Tommy Angelo: You guys deal in broad daylight?

Paulie: Normally – nah. But this was their first drop-off. And the cops know better than to come sniffing around our turf. Morello, the guy whose cars you’re gonna torch, he’s got more friends on the force than us. But we’re okay, so long as we’re careful. Keep an eye over our shoulder. Some of the Canadian whiskey that comes through – if you want a bottle, just ask. We keep some back for friends.

Tommy Angelo: Ah, I’m no big drinker. I used to tip back bathtub gin most days, but…not so much now. That stuff’s no good for you.

Paulie: You don’t have to go blind now though. Through us you’ve got a line on the good stuff.

Tommy Angelo: That’s good of you. Thanks.

Paulie: It’s not just the booze we supply, Tom – it’s the places we deliver to. The dames they got in these places! Best tables, best food, best skirt. It’s some way to live.

Tommy Angelo: Right now all I want is to wreck the day of the bastards who wrecked mine.

Paulie: Sure. Sure.

Tommy Angelo: Besides, all this could get a guy in trouble.

Paulie: ‘Trouble’ says the guy who’s about to set fire to Morello’s parking lot… (laughs)

Tommy Angelo: I got you to protect me. It’ll go fine.

Paulie: Well if it don’t go fine, try not to let them see your face. Either that or hit ‘em so hard they don’t remember it. We’re gettin’ onto Morello’s turf now.

Tommy Angelo: There’s some line between his streets and Salieri’s streets?

Paulie: Not really. There’s always some give and some take. Though in general we look after Little Italy, and his guys work North Park – and more besides. If you’re walking on the wrong sidewalk, in the wrong part of town, you start getting a sense you need to be someplace else. You can feel it long before they start appearing on street corners to stare you down. Okay, it’s close by. 

[Tommy stops the car.]

Paulie: Morello’s goons smoke and jaw up front, and leave their motors out back. They’re some lazy bastards. They put some gorilla on guard duty – but it’s always some no-name schmuck. Come on. Over here. You gotta sneak in, and wreck the cars. Send a message.

Tommy Angelo: Sure. Why are you coming with?

Paulie: To see if you get shot. Okay, we got quiet. You know how to go quiet right? Yeah, like that. If no-one sees our heads, no-one tries to pop ‘em. Get over this gate and up onto their roof, and I’ll go keep their chump busy while you creep up and jump him from behind. I’m real good at distracting – it’s my best thing.

[Tommy climbs up to the second floor and hides on the balcony. Paulie distracts the guard near the gates.]

Paulie: Hey! What the hell are you doin’?

Guard: What do you mean what am I doin’?

Paulie: I mean what I say! What the hell are you doing back there?!

Guard: Who are you?

Paulie: A guy who don’t know what idiot told you to keep look-out here!

Guard: Dino! Dino told me!

Paulie: Dino? Salieri’s got guys all over town trying to give Morello a black eye – and Dino makes you guard the cars? 

Guard: Listen fella -  who are you? You know Dino?

Paulie: Yeah! I know Dino!

[Tommy sneaks behind guard’s back and chokes him.]

Paulie: Just like that, you got it! There was this one time when I had the chance to get him from behind and choke him out - but for some reason I hung back. Missed my chance! So let’s get to these cars… Take your bat and start swinging. 

[Tommy starts breaking cars with a baseball bat.]

Paulie: That motor really got you pissed, huh? No-one’s driving that again. Ah crap.

Goon: Hey! Get away from the car!

Paulie: Knock him down Tom!

Goon: You got some kind of death wish?

Paulie: Just like that, you got it! C’mon Tom, quick. There’s gonna be more of them. Use a Molotov and let’s see some flames. Yeah. You got that nice and good. Yeah. Morello’s crew would’ve heard that…

Tommy Angelo: Whole block heard that.

Paulie: We gotta go! We can take Dino’s car.

Tommy Angelo: How’d you know this is Dino’s car?

Paulie: If I don’t like you, and you got a good car, I’m gonna know where you keep it. Straight through the gate! We gotta get out of here before the bulls show! They’re shooting! Drive! Drive! Ah shit. We got cops.

Tommy Angelo: So, uh – what do we do?

Paulie: We lose them by driving real fast and getting clear of them.

Tommy Angelo: Sounds good.

Paulie: Right now they’re pissed, but let’s not get ‘em real pissed. We’re good. Let’s head back and see the boss.

Tommy Angelo: I thought Salieri had cops on the books?

Paulie: Some street cops, sure, but Morello’s got the Chief in his pocket. So how’d it feel? It feel good?

Tommy Angelo: How’d what feel?

Paulie: Taking out the guy. Taking Dino’s car. It feel good?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah… I guess it did.

Paulie: There’s no time like the first time Tom. It don’t get better. You think it’s for you? This life?

Tommy Angelo: What’s it to you?

Paulie: Hey, I’m just asking questions. I like asking questions.

Tommy Angelo: I doubt that every day you and Sam go and panel-beat motors in parking lots.

Paulie: Eh. There’s busy days, there’s slow days. You’ve had more of an introduction than I ever got.

Tommy Angelo: You never got to beat up Dino’s pals and take his motor?

Paulie: Nah. Stole enough cars to get noticed, I guess. And when I got squeezed by the cops – knew never to squeal. Then one day I found myself in the yard behind the bar jawing with Vincenzo. And ten years go by, and I’m still here. Though I got a suit now, and Vinny’s an old bastard.

Tommy Angelo: I always thought that to be in a family, you had to have more…connections. Your brother, or your uncle, or…

Paulie: Oh some guys, sure – their cousins got made, or you’re like Carlo whose pop went way back with the Don. That means you get trusted more when you’re starting out, but there’s plenty of us who came in off the street. I’m thinking, we get you in front of the boss, then we tip a few.

Tommy Angelo: Well, I don’t got plans so…

Paulie: Sure you don’t got plans. The plans are to feed Vinny so much booze that Luigi has to roll him out of the door again.

Tommy Angelo: I’m good with whatever.

Paulie: Sure you are.

[Tommy returns the car to the garage outside Solieri's restaurant.]

Ralphie: Wha-at happened to the c-car I sent y-ya out with?

Paulie: Dumped it.

Ralphie: Wh-why?

Paulie: It was a boiler. This one’s better.

Ralphie: A b-better car, with a b-broken window?

Paulie: Fresh air never killed nobody.

[Tommy and Paulie enter the restaurant.]

Guy: He’s still with you then?

Tommy Angelo: Somehow, yeah.

[They go back to the boss's office.]

Paulie: Hey boss. It’s done.

Don Salieri: No trouble?

Tommy Angelo: Nothing we couldn’t handle, Mr. Salieri.

Don Salieri: Good, good. Sit down. You see Morello?

Paulie: Nah. But he’ll be plenty pissed when his boys tell him what happened.

Don Salieri: (laughs) He’s not going to be able to think straight for weeks. See, that’s the difference between me and Morello. I’m a businessman. I do everything with this. (touches his head) Every decision I make, it’s what’s good for the business and my boys. But Morello… He’s a hothead. And all that anger, burns out the brain. When he gets mad, he gets stupid.

Paulie: You got nothin’ like that to worry about with Tommy here. He was aces the whole way, boss.

Don Salieri: I’m glad to hear it. I’ve got a growing business here. We could use a guy like you to help out around the bar, maybe run some errands, and make sure that bills get paid on time. Are you up for that?

Tommy Angelo: Oh, it’d be an honor, sir.

Don Salieri: Good, good. Now, Paulie and Sam have already vouched for you, but you need to understand we have a few rules around here. So you listen, and listen good. First, no cursing on the premises. There’s a million words out there, and the man who needs to resort to “fuck this” and “fuck that” is just ignorant or lazy. Second, we don’t deal in the hard stuff. I don’t want any dope fiends in this neighborhood. We’ll let Morello poison his own people, if that’s what he wants. Finally, stay out of trouble with the cops. We only have a few on the payroll, and if you cross a line, the rest’ll come after you. You understand?

Tommy Angelo: Yes, Mr. Salieri.

Don Salieri: Then I’m gonna only ask you for one more thing, Tommy. I don’t keep Paulie and Sam around just because they’re strong. A lot of guys out there bigger and tougher than these two. And I don’t keep Frank on the payroll because he’s smart, though he is an artist with the numbers. All these guys, in this room, they’re here because they have the only thing that matters to me. The only thing that should matter to any of us. You know what that is, Tommy?

Tommy Angelo: They’re loyal.

Don Salieri: That’s right. Now you stay straight with me, you’re gonna be livin’ the high life, Tom. But, you abuse my trust, well…

Tommy Angelo: Don Salieri, you won’t ever need to worry about me.

Don Salieri: Okay then. Welcome to the family. 

[He kisses Tommy's cheeks.]

Don Salieri: Excellent. Now I’m starving. Luigi! Let’s eat!

Frank: Welcome.

Sam: Our barman Luigi’s not much of a cook, but his daughter Sarah? Marone!

Chapter 4: Ordinary Routine (1930)
[Morning. Tommy stands in the courtyard outside the restaurant, watching the guys practice hand-to-hand wrestling.]

Tommy Angelo: (offscreen) Those first days in Salieri’s Bar were slow. I moved crates and delivered messages. The guys busted balls and told stories from the old country. Mostly, we just waited. I got to thinking, maybe life in Salieri’s crew wasn’t gonna get me clipped. But what did I know?

[A man approaches him.]

Crew: You Tommy?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah.

Crew: Boss is waiting for you.

Tommy Angelo: Thanks.

[He walks into the restaurant and goes to the boss's office.]

Paulie: Here he is.

Tommy Angelo: Sorry I’m late.

Don Salieri: Take a seat. It’s collection day, boys. So, Tommy, you’ll drive. Paulie and Sam can handle the rest. It’ll be routine.

Sam: Just a handful of stops today.

Don Salieri: Bill at the motel was a little short last month. So, make sure he pays us the interest he owes.

Paulie: No problem, boss.

Frank: Don’t lay hands on anyone unless there is no other choice. Our clients need to understand that we provide valuable service. They need to look at you and see Saint Michael. They need to believe you’ll protect them.

Don Salieri: So let Morello stoop to breaking legs. We’re better than that. But, the bill’s still due and everyone pays up.

Sam: We can handle it.

Don Salieri: Go see Ralphie about a car.

Tommy Angelo: Okay boss.

[They leave the office.]

Paulie: Vinny said to say he’s got somethin’ for you, Tom. Head to him first. Probably just wants to tell you some bullshit story about some guy he whacked twenty years ago…

[Tommy goes to talk to Vincenzo and overhear Paulie talking near the door.]

Crew: You guys need to be careful today okay? I spoke to Biff. He said Morello's still bent since he lost the cars.

Paulie: Ah, what's losing some motors to him? He got at least five garages this side of to m

Sam: He’s not wrong, Paulie…

Paulie: You guys know it like I know: it's always the same. Morello does this, so Salieri does that. Some cars here, some booze there. Things calm down for a few weeks, when it all happens again. World keeps turning.

Crew: Well, it has been a month…

Paulie: A month's made of weeks. Quit whining.

[Tommy walks into Vincenzo's workshop.]

Vinny: Hey! Just the guy… I saw this, and I thought of you…

[He puts a small six-shot revolver on the table.]

Vinny: You ever carry a rod?

Tommy Angelo: Shot ‘em at the fair a couple of times.

Vinny: Right, that don’t count. Point it at the target over there. Good posture, real mean. Now: click, click, click. Bang. Brain all up the walls. Okay, now show me a reload. Open the chamber and away you go. Last thing, it needs to be hidden. Stick it in your belt. Good to go. When shooting starts, get behind something and don’t shit yourself.

Tommy Angelo: Thanks Vincenzo, I appreciate it.

Vinny: Hey, to Frank and the Boss it’s Vincenzo – to you, it’s Vinny.

[Tommy takes the gun and goes to the garage.]

NEWSPAPER -OCT 29TH 1930
1 YEAR SINCE THE CRASH
The worst panic in Wall Street's peace-time history was one year ago today and still no escape from the wider economic depression that has followed it. Unemployment reached 8% this month, but given the prevailing trend of shuttering businesses, banks and foreclosed farmsteads some economists warn that this could double - perhaps even TRIPLE in the coming years.
SPECIAL PICTURE FEATURE SHOWING SCENES FROM EVERY STATE

Ralphie: Y-y-you know how t-t-to get into one of these T-Tommy?

Tommy Angelo: Elbow goes through. Reach inside. Easy.

Ralphie: A-and an afternoon to f-f-fix the window back up… Watch and… learn.

[He shows Tommy how to open car locks.]

Tommy Angelo: You’re a regular magician, Ralphie.

Ralphie: Hmm. Come one T-Tommy. Show me what you c-can d-do. Okay, it’s c-caught. You g-got it. Have a good day f-fellas.

[The gangsters get into the car.]

Sam: First we got Al. He runs the bakery on Longman Street. You know it?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, I know it.

Paulie: Al’s late again?

Sam: Seems so.

Paulie: Huh. That’s too bad.

[Tommy pulls up to the first place to collect.]

Sam: Okay, this is it. Watch what we do today, Tom. When it goes smooth it’s a breeze, when they put up a fight… sometimes you gotta think on your feet.

Tommy Angelo: Sure.

Sam: Just follow my lead.

Al: Sam! Paulie! How are you?

Sam: We’re good! How’s little Giulia?

Al: Ha! Not so little now. She’s turning into a pain in the ass just like her Grandma.

Paulie: That’s good to hear, Al. Real good.

LETTER FROM BANK
Dear Mr Bertorelli,
This letter is notification that you are in default of your obligation to make payments on your agreed loan.
This amount has been overdue since July 15th 1930. You have ignored requests to pay this debt. Unless the full amount is received within two weeks, I will have no choice but to instruct this bank to begin the foreclosure process on your home and business.
Please act accordingly,
Christopher Marcino
Manager, Grand Imperial Bank

Sam: Now, you got any trouble round here? Any punks causing problems?

Al: No, no… nothing like that.

Sam: Good. So you got the money?

Al: I got it waiting in the back room. I’ll…

Paulie: Tommy’ll get it. You stay here where we can see you.

Al: It’s been a real slow this month Sam. I was worried I wouldn’t have enough.

Sam: Al, I know you’d never hold out on us. But it’s good to worry. I mean how can we protect you, and little Giulia, without payment?

[Tommy walks up to a woman in the improvised bakery office.]

Tommy Angelo: Where’s the money?

Al’s Mother: Terrone! Feccia! Voi ci succhiate il sangue! (Asshole! Scumbag! You suck our blood!)

Al: It’s on the table! Brown envelope.

[Tommy picks up the envelope.]

Al’s Mother: Via di qui! Lasciateci in pace! (Get out of here! Leave us alone!)

Tommy Angelo: (to Sam) I got it.

Sam: We’ll see you next month Al. Let us know if you need anything. Anything at all.

Al: Sure will Sam! Sure will…

Paulie: And give our best to your Ma – huh?

[They leave the bakery and get in the car.]

Sam: Okay, next up we got old Eugene’s place. China Store up on Tallow.

Paulie: He’s not dead yet?

Sam: Almost. I heard his nephew’s taken over.

Paulie: Guy who used to run this next place, Tom. His name’s not Eugene – guy’s a Chinaman – but it sounds like Eugene. So that’s what we called him.

Sam: Paulie slammed his head into the counter back in…’27 I think?

Paulie: Yeah. It was hilarious. After that: No problems at all.

Sam: If you look you can still see the blood. Poor old bastard couldn’t scrub it out. We keep some of these guys on our books to remind the Chinatown gangs they’re in our city – not theirs. But we don’t know Eugene’s nephew – so he might need reminding too. This is it.

[They drive up to the store.]

Paulie: I’ll cover this one Sam.

Sam: You sure?

Paulie: Sure I’m sure.

[He gets out of the car and walks toward the store. On the sign you can see the inscription 森記言, which, as far as I understand, does not have any translation and is just a set of common characters.]

Tommy Angelo: He’s doing the store on his own?

Sam: Ah, when Paulie’s built up a little steam he needs to let it out on his own. You’ve just gotta let him on with it. It’s his way. You can hear it in his voice. Gotta let him “lone wolf” from time to time. Keeps him happy. Yeah, Eugene’s nephew ain’t having much fun right now. When he’s going, Paulie don’t stop. Once we were putting the squeeze on this tailor over Holbrook and the guy ended up in a wheelchair.

Tommy Angelo: Here he comes.

Sam: He’s a fast worker.

[Paulie comes out of the store and gets in the car.]

Paulie: Drive before the cops show, Tom. Next stop’s Bill at the motel. Eugene’s nephew guy’s money is ours next week, with some extra besides.

Sam: He doing okay?

Paulie: He’s okay.

Tommy Angelo: How’s the shop counter?

Paulie: Yeah. That’s seen some more blood.

Sam: How much blood?

Paulie: Nothing he can’t scrub out. Once he’s back on his feet.

Sam: Want to come out with us again Tom? You’d get to hear even more about chinese nephew guys scrubbing their own blood outta shop counters.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, seems like it’s not too hard.

Sam: Not hard. What kinda ‘not hard’?

Tommy Angelo: I don’t know. Comes natural to you guys, don’t see why it can’t come natural to me.

Sam: So anyone could do this? Me and Paulie, we’ve been working these streets for years. You come in – and you think you know it all?

Tommy Angelo: I’m not saying that Sam, I…

Sam: You’ve been a day on the job, pal. You haven’t seen what we do, you haven’t seen how we do it.

Paulie: Sam, I think you oughta…

Sam: No Paulie! This punk thinks he can walk in here like a big shot? I put greasers like him in the ground!

Paulie: I think you gotta say you’re sorry, Tom.

Tommy Angelo: Sorry huh? I’d say sorry, if I couldn’t see the bullshit smile you’re tryin’ to hide.

Paulie: You got him though Sam! You got him!

Sam: I could smell the crap in your pants from here.

Tommy Angelo: Nah. You didn’t get me.

Sam: When Little Tony first came out with us, I had him on his knees before he knew I was yanking his chain.

Paulie: Yeah, you did better than him anyways. Jesus, I hate it out of the city.

Sam: You hate it most places.

Paulie: Yeah, but out here? It’s worse.

Tommy Angelo: How come there’s a place so far out of town on our books?

Sam: Out of town’s the safest place for deals, safest place for card games, safest place for most things we do…

Paulie: We’re expecting a big bag of money today. The guy owes. If it ain’t big, the boss’ll be pissed.

Sam: Yeah, this place is a real earner. Oftentimes the places that get you the most dough are the ones most people don’t look at twice.

Paulie: Just recently the motel’s had a new lease of life.

Sam: Last stop before Lost Heaven for rum coming up from Cuba.

Tommy Angelo: They drive it this far?

Sam: Sure they do. And that's how we can sell it so expensive.

Paulie: Bill's Motel has gotten to be the place where crates get exchanged. Salieri protects it, but he lets the other families use it too.

Tommy Angelo: Even Morello?

Sam: To keep the peace? Sure. Plus it's far enough away that no-one cares. So long as everyone's making money, no-one's gonna rock the boat.

Paulie: Anyone else starting to miss the sights of streets and sidewalks?

Tommy Angelo: You not one for the great outdoors, Paulie?

Sam: He's not one for anything. Indoors, outdoors, in the city, out of the city...

Paulie: I hate it out here. Like when we sit in a field doing some booze handover or something. It's always knee-deep in shit, and most times its dark and cold as hell!

Sam: That's why its good we got you now, Tom. You can do all the jobs that Paulie hates.

Tommy Angelo: Happy to oblige.

Sam: Okay, there it is.

Paulie: Finally.

[Tommy pulls up at a small motel in the suburbs.]

Paulie: Wait for us here, Tom. We'll be back in a bit. 

Tommy Angelo: Okay.

[Tommy gets out of the car to smoke a cigarette. He sees a "No Smoking" sign and, smiling, lights up. Suddenly he hears a shot. Paulie walks out of the motel, staggering.]

Paulie: Ah! Tom! Tommy... I took one...

Tommy Angelo: Jesus Christ, Paulie!

[After him comes out a gangster in an expensive suit and hat. The gangster is holding a gun that looks like a Browning M1903.]

Gangster: Tell Salieri from here on out this place is ours. Capisce? And don't come back, or you'll end up in worse shape than your friends.

[The gangster leaves.]

Paulie: Get Sam. They're tryin' to beat information out of him...

Tommy Angelo: I gotta get you to a doctor.

[He helps Paulie get to the car.]

Paulie: That can wait! Get Sam outta there!

Tommy Angelo: Okay! Okay, just hang on! 

[Tommy is looking for a way to sneak into the motel. He hears voices coming from inside.]

Gangster: Who wrecked the motors? Give me a name!

Sam: Herbert Hoover. (coughs)

[Tommy sneaks around choking Morello's thugs like a ninja.]

Gangster: Next time I'll tell him. I'll tell him I've had enough of his bullshit.

Sam: That how it works with you Morello guys? You rat each other out so easy?

Gangster: All I want is a goddamn name!

Sam: Go to hell!

[Tommy sneaks into the motel and, after killing the gangster sitting on the toilet, takes his shotgun.]

ELECTION PAMPHLET
BRING PROSPERITY
ELECT ROBERTO GHILLOTTI FOR CITY COUNCIL, 1930
A trusted figure in Lost Heaven. Owner of boat yards and industry. Employer to thousands. Friend of the City. Dutiful Father and Husband.

[Tommy finds Sam in the storeroom. He's covered in blood and barely moving.]

Tommy Angelo: Sam! They really went to work on you buddy.

[Tommy helps him to his feet.]

Sam: Christ...

Tommy Angelo: C'mon, you'll be alright. You're tough as nails—

[Suddenly a man with a suitcase attacked him from around the corner. He knocks Tommy and Sam to the ground and runs out of the motel.]

Tommy Angelo: ...Oh shit...

Sam: He's got the money, Tom!

Tommy Angelo: I'll catch the bastard. 

[Tommy runs out into the street. The man with the suitcase is already in his car.]

Paulie: Where’s Sam?

Tommy Angelo: Helena:’s okay, inside.

Paulie: Then go get the money!

[Tommy gets in the car and chases after the man with the suitcase. The chase proves to be fierce. As he approaches, Tommy pulls out a gun and shoots the driver in the head. His car slowly comes to a stop. Tommy pulls up and approaches the car to retrieve the suitcase.]

Tommy Angelo: (offscreen) That was when I saw the cost. What it meant to be on the inside. I should've took off there and then, but I couldn't go back to bein' a nobody.

Intermezzo (Interlude) (1938)
[We find ourselves back in the same diner from the beginning of the game with Detective Norman.]

Detective Norman: So that's how a regular palooka goes from cabbie to mob enforcer over night, is it? Just dumb luck?

Tommy Angelo: It didn't feel that way at the time... Me parkin' on that particular street, takin' a break just as Paulie and Sam are comin' around the corner? What are the odds? It felt like... I don't know, like someone was watchin' out for us.

Detective Norman: Whatever helps you sleep at night, pal. But it's a lucky break, all the same. I mean, one day you're bustin' your back doin' an honest days work in a city that's been tryin' to scrape you off its heel since the day you stepped off the boat. And the next, you're stuffin' your pockets full of Salieri's dirty money, and lordin' over the rest of us.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, it wasn't like that. Back then, Salieri didn't have the run of the city. For every buck Salieri made, Don Morello would turn 10. He paid off cops, politicians, judges. And anyone he couldn't buy, he scared into lookin' the other way.

Detective Norman: He did seem to have the city jumpin' at its own shadow, I'll give you that.

Tommy Angelo: You hear anythin' about Joey Crackers?

Detective Norman: Got his name in the Morello file, sure. A boxer, right?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah... That's the guy. Way I hear it, Joey was just drivin' to the gym one mornin'... Probably daydreamin' about winnin' the belt or somethin'.

[A Ford Model T is driving down the street at a low speed, with a burly man behind the wheel. He stops at a crosswalk to stare at a girl in a red dress. From behind, a Mercedes-Benz 540K Cabriolet (or a similar car, it's hard to see) crashes into him at full speed.]

Joey Crackers: Goddammit! Moron! You drivin' with your goddamn eyes closed? Look at this!

[He walks toward the car that crashed into him and then notices the driver.]

Joey Crackers: Oh Jesus, Mary and Joseph... Don... Don Morello. I didn't know it was you.

Don Morello: You know anybody else driving a rare import in this part of town, Joey?

Joey Crackers: No. And I'm sorry. I was drivin' real slow...

Don Morello: You saying this is my fault?

Joey Crackers: No! No, no, no sir. I just... I just, I ain't-- I ain't never been in no accident...

Don Morello: Well, repairs are gonna be expensive.

[Don Morello opens his trunk and pulls out a lug wrench.]

Joey Crackers: You're not gonna need that, sir. Tires are just fine. The grills a little bent up, is all. I got a cousin that can--

[Don Morello starts hitting Joey with the wrench until he falls to the ground. Passersby and two policemen are watching, all of them pretending that nothing is going on. Back  to the diner.]

Detective Norman: Someone spun you a tale, pal. I got an informant right there says Morello made a mint every time Crackers went to the mat.

Tommy Angelo: That's true too. And still, Morello left that poor sap dead in the street, head all caved in.

Detective Norman: That don't square.

Tommy Angelo: Maybe the Don knew Joey's career was on the downhill. Maybe he was tryin' to scare some other guy into payin' up. Who knows. Don Salieri chalked it up to Morello not being able to think straight when he was mad.

Detective Norman: You have any more run-ins with Morello's crew back then?

Tommy Angelo: Not at first. For a couple of years after I joined up, things were quiet. We got into a few dust ups with guys tryin' to muscle in, but elsewise it was just the usual routine. Runnin' booze, offerin' protection, me and the boys doin' the rounds to collect. Small-time. But I ain't gonna lie. Most days, we were also havin' a bit of fun.

Chapter 5: Fair Play (1932)
[Tommy comes to Salieri's restaurant. He is already waiting for him at a table, smoking a cigar as usual.]

Don Salieri: Tommy. Thanks for getting down here so quickly.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, sure thing, boss. What do you need?

Don Salieri: You know there's a race comin' up?

Tommy Angelo: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Paulie and Sam have some money on the local.

Don Salieri: Mikey Dunne.

Tommy Angelo: That's the guy.

Don Salieri: He's a good kid, but a bit of a scrapper, not too smart with his money. A few years ago, Mikey comes to me, asking for a loan. He wants to get new tires so he can keep racing junkers out at the quarry. I like fast cars, I figure it'll be a bit of a hobby. Turns out, Mikey's a great investment. The kid can't lose a race if he walks the track. He graduates from junkers to gow jobs, and I start placin' a few bets on him here and there. Next thing I know, I've made all my money back and more.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, Sam says he's the guy to beat.

Don Salieri: He was. We ran all the competition out of town, but now Ralph says there's a hotshot European entering the race, and he's got a car faster than our boy's by a country mile.

Tommy Angelo: How much do we stand to lose?

Don Salieri: A truckload. But not just our outfit. A lot of guys from the neighborhood come to me for financial advice. They've all put money down on this kid. It'll be like Black Thursday around here if he loses. Well, for everyone except Morello.

Tommy Angelo: You think he's frontin' the european?

Don Salieri: Oh, I'm certain of it.

Tommy Angelo: You want somethin' to happen to the driver?

Don Salieri: Can't find him. Morello's got him holed up somewhere safe. Besides, if he drops out or disappears now, none of our wagers'll stand. Everyone'll cry foul, say the race is fixed.

Tommy Angelo: What about his car?

Don Salieri: That's the ticket, Tommy. Ralph knows a guard at the track. You'll go down there tonight, you'll boost the European's car, bring it to one of our mechanics, he'll make a few adjustments, you bring the car back.

Tommy Angelo: Should be no problem, boss.

[He leaves the table and wanders around the restorant.]

Don Salieri: Sarah, can I get a drink here? Soon as you're ready.

Sarah: Sure thing.

Don Salieri: Your pop letting you out for the race?

Sarah: You kidding? Feels like we're packing this place up and moving it to the stands.

Don Salieri: Ah, he likes to make sure I have something to drink when I win.

NEWSPAPER - SEPT 3RD 1932
RACE DAY APPROACHES!
THE GRANDEST DAY IN THE SPORTING CALENDAR IS ALMOST UPON US! Record crowds are expected to descend upon the Lost Heaven Autodrome this weekend, as the city basks in glorious sunshine! Famous German driver Martin Lichtenberg is taking some time away from the International Series to challenge Lost Heaven's hero Mikey Dunne, and racing fans are on tenterhooks!

Sarah: Heu Tom, do you have a place to go, or does Don Salieri just pay you to make the place look pretty? 

Don Salieri: He's got plenty of places to go! C'mon Tom, this job's against the  clock.

[Tommy goes out into the yard.]

Luigi: So that's five... Six... along with what's already behind the bar and... Buonasera Tommy. 

Ralphie: Hey T-t-tommy! Big day coming up, right? Y-y-you seen the race before?

Tommy Angelo: Kinda hard to miss. Salieri isn't gonna let Morello break his winning streak, huh?

Ralphie: N-no, sir! Gotta send him a m-message. So... tonight we b-borrow his guy's motor from the track. My friend Bobby is the guard- and for a little dough he'll show you where it is and then look someplace else while you t-t-turn the key.

Tommy Angelo: I like Bobby already.

Ralphie: S-sure. Th-th-then there's this other guy L-L-Lucas Bertone. You take the car to him down under the G-giu-Giuliano Bridge. He'll... y'know... tune it a little. Make the race tomorrow mo-mo-more interesting.

Tommy Angelo: Then I take the car straight back, and Bobby can stop lookin' someplace else'...

Ralphie: B-b-but you gotta be quick. B-Bobby comes off shift at one-thirty. And the n-n-next guy, he's an ass. H-hey. If you need somewhere to keep your m-motors safe where no-one c-can t-take 'em - f-feel free ta use the garage. Carlo f-finally got around to clearing it out.

[Tommy chooses a car and drives out of the garage, then goes to meet the guard.]

Tommy Angelo: You Bobby?

Bobby: Yup. We can take my car through to the garage. Place is empty.

Tommy Angelo: Any friend of Ralphie is a friend of mine.

Bobby: If you got the money, sure. Tomorrow morning they start coming. Whole city. They smuggle in hooch. There's fighting. I hate it.

Tommy Angelo: Ah c'mon. Name a better place to pick up a dame than this place, this weekend.

Bobby: Don't get me started. Things I've seen... Okay, this is it. Here she is. 1929 Carozella C-Series. Best in class. It's a shame you gotta wreck it.

Tommy Angelo: If they see this on the road, cops are gonna ask questions.

Bobby: When they catch up, sure. Try to keep it in one piece too, huh?

Tommy Angelo: So I gotta be back from Bertone by one-thirty? Before the next guy's shift?

Bobby: Yeh. He's an ass.

Tommy Angelo: I heard.

[Tommy takes the race car and drives it to Lucas Bertone's garage.]

Lucas: You're here!

Tommy Angelo: Tommy Angelo.

Lucas: Lucas Bertone. Ah, ain't she a thing of beauty...

Tommy Angelo: We don't have much time.

Lucas: Hey, I'm a fast worker. Sit tight. Hello, you.

[He begins to "improve" the car and Tommy goes out for a smoke.]

Lucas: Okay, she's done!

Tommy Angelo: Thanks Lucas. I gotta get back before anyone catches on.

Lucas: Go easy with her, she's gonna misbehave. Hey, tell Mister Salieri I'm always available for this kinda work. I do stuff for a lot of people, but I always know where I stand with you guys. Hot cars, getaways... anything for the right price.

Tommy Angelo: Let's just hope Salieri's guy wins tomorrow - for all our sakes.

Lucas: Okay. Drive careful.

[Tommy returns the car to Bobby's garage. Now that her engine is overheating it's a lot harder to do!]

Bobby: You're back. Thank Christ.

Tommy Angelo: Good to go - drives like a jalopy.

Bobby: Okay let's get out of here. Big day tomorrow.

[The next day it's time for the race. Paulie, Sam, and Tommy stand by the fence and smoke.]

Paulie: So Sam walks outta the bathroom, and I'm praying he's got a piece on him. 'Cause I'm not sure the bartender is going to hand over what he owes, and his two sons they're inching closer. I can hear them cracking their knuckles. They're both seven feet tall, built like brick shithouses.

Tommy Angelo: What were you carrying?

Sam: My dick. (laughs)

Paulie: That's right. This crazy bastard, he waltzes outta the bathroom, just starts pissin' all over the joint.

Tommy Angelo: Really? What? He didn't call the cops?

Sam: Nah. Sometimes, you just gotta make 'em think you're crazy.

Frank: Tom, you got a moment?

Tommy Angelo: Sure Frank.

Frank: We got a bit of a situation.

Tommy Angelo: Is the boss okay?

Frank: Yeah, it's nothing like that. Mikey Dunne, our driver? Some of Morello's guys roughed him up pretty good last night. Broke his arm, broke his jaw. Sent him to the hospital.

Tommy Angelo: Jesus.

Frank: Yeah, tough luck for Mikey. Anyway, you're going to race for him.

Tommy Angelo: Wait, what? Frank I--

Frank: Tom, it's a half hour before the starting gun goes off. So this is not a discussion. The Don wants to win, but more importantly, he wants Morello to lose. And you are our best wheelman. Otherwise, I'd be talking to someone else.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, okay Frank.

Frank: Good. Ralphie has the car gassed and ready. Get to the track right away.

[The race begins!]

Announcer: From Europe we got the hotshot favorite... Martin Lichtenberg, taking some time out of the international series to compete with us today! Got some news from the grid here. Lost Heaven local favorite Mickey Dunne is out! Replacing him is... Tommy Angelo. Well, I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing him: good luck. They're lined up on the grid, they're ready to start! They're off!

[The race cars start moving.]

Announcer: The pack roars away, but there are some worried laces from the mechanics in the pit lane! Lichtenberg's in trouble! There's something up with his car!

[Tommy rams one of the racers.]

Racer: You're kidding me?!

Announcer: Let's hope for a safe race today, folks.

Racer: You asshole!

Racer: Jesus!

Announcer: McKellen's looking comfortable in first, with the pack closing in behind!

Racer: Ah, crap!

Announcer: Taylor. Anderson. Angelo. All in the mix still, with time still left to go.

Racer: Some rough racing oufitbere. Hopefully nothing serious.

Announcer: Tommy Angelo takes the lead. Some drivers really starting to stretch out ahead now!

Racer: Ha! Amateur!

Racer: What?! Him?!

Announcer: What a race today folks! The driving's been incredible! The race leaders roar into the second lap!

Racer: Son of-a-bitch!

Racer: Shit!

Announcer: With Lichtenberg no longer a contender, the front three are jostling for position. Up close and personal with the pack leaders! This race is far from over! Angelo there, back in the lead position! Can he hold on? Anderson and Garcia aro in second and third Wolting for a mistake from Angelo! It's a tight pack as they fight for first! Who needs Mikey Dunne? This guy is a fine replacement! Newcomer Tommy Angelo is still out in front! Angelo is still out in front! Can he hold on? Who's going to catch the leading driver Tommy Angelo? Lichtenberg's exit really has blown this race out wide! They all smell victory! Tommy Angelo's in first, but will he stay there?

[Tommy wins the race! Back to the race track garage.]

Vincenzo: Hey, Tommy! There's our winner!

Lucas: Hey Tom. I just want to thank you for stepping in like you did. I had six months' rent ridin' on that race. I'd be homeless now if not for you.

Tommy Angelo: I just did what the Don asked, Lucas.

Lucas: Well, you gotta let me find a way to repay you. Stop by my garage when you get a chance. I might have a line on somethin' that'll turn a buck for you.

Tommy Angelo: Sure. Thanks.

Don Salieri: I knew you wouldn't let us down, Tom! You made us all a lot of money today. And Morello is gonna be pickin' up pennies off the sidewalk for weeks!

Tommy Angelo: What about the European?

Don Salieri: Hah he's probably wearing cement boots by now, the poor bastard. Here. You've earned every dollar of this. Take your girl out somewhere nice.

Tommy Angelo: Thanks boss.

[He furtively looks at Sarah, who is drinking with the others.]

Sarah: Drink up, boys.

Don Salieri: You've got a girl, right? I don't want you blowing all that on booze and whores.

Sarah: That race was really somethin', huh?

Tommy Angelo: Nah. But maybe I'll buy my ma a new coat.

Don Salieri: Good boy. Go get yourself a drink.

Sarah: Congratulations, big hero.

Tommy Angelo: I just got lucky, is all.

Sarah: Well, I had my money on the other guy, so the drinks are on you. (Tommy drinks) There. Now you're ready for the pictures.

Tommy Angelo: Thanks.

Sarah: And hey, when you're done celebratin', you might want to find your buddy Paulie. He's so drunk, he's gonna get hit by a parked car.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, okay. I'll get him home safe.

Sarah: Paulie and the rest of your pals have drunk through half my bar already. You found him yet?

Announcer: That's all for another year folks. Track will be open until six. Please leave when requested.

Tommy Angelo: Mhm.

Vincenzo: You're a natural wheelman, Tom.

Tommy Angelo: You seen Paulie anywhere, Vin?

Vincenzo: He said he was gonna go eat to soak up the booze. But I've never seen cannolis come that big.

[Tommy finds Ralphie.]

Ralphie: You m-made th-that look e-easy T-Tommy! Wh-when they st-started racing here tw-twenty years ago most g-guys d-didn't even
m-make the f-finish.

Tommy Angelo: Ah, magic's in the motor Ralph. I just showed it where to go. Hey, you seen Paulie?

Ralphie: Dunno. Said he w-was hungry or something.

Tommy Angelo: Okay. You enjoy yourself.

Ralphie: S-sure will Tom. Thanks!

[Tommy approaches Frank.]

Tommy Angelo: Mhm.

Frank: That win just put my daughter through another year at school Tom.

Tommy Angelo: Hey, anything for the Collettis.

Frank: Well, enjoy the moment. But, deal with Paulie before he  embarrasses himself and the family. I will not let the boss' day end... sourly.

Tommy Angelo: You don't have to worry Frank. I'll find him.

Announcer: I've been asked by the LHPD to remind all racegoers that the sale and consumption of alcohol is strictly prohibited - and arrests will be made. Thank you.

Man: This your first time at the track?

Woman 1: Last year I heard the motors from my apartment - but that's as close as I’ve gotten before.

Woman 2: They'll start to try to clear us out before dark, but ignore 'em. The party won't stop.

[Tommy approaches Lucas.]

Lucas: How'd she drive after the tune-up?

Tommy Angelo: Tried to go sidelong into five brick walls. But we made it. You seen Paulie anyplace?

Lucas: Came by five minutes ago maybe. Looked like he'd had a smell from the barrel.

Tommy Angelo: Sounds about right. Thanks Lucas.

Michelle: Great race champ!

Sam: Hey, last time I saw you drive like that, Tom, I had a gun to your head!

Tommy Angelo: You saying there wasn't one today?

Sam: Ha! When our side of town is drowning in dough, that means you're safe! Hey, you seen Paulie? Guy's soused, Came through walkin' sideways.

Tommy Angelo: Yeh, I heard.

Announcer: I'd ask again that people please leave when requested, and refrain from imbibing illicit substances. Let's not make it like last year folks.

Bobby: Thank Christ you're here! If your friend keeps this up the other guy's gonna send the cops over.

Tommy Angelo: Yeh. I think Paulie's big day at the track's over.

[He finally finds Paulie sitting in the stables.]

Paulie: (singing) Cow says "moo" and a chicken says "quack", what does a bird say?

Tommy Angelo: I don't know but the security guy back there says you gotta go home.

Paulie: Guy's an asshole. He should show some respect!

Tommy Angelo: That's true, but I'm saying you gotta go home too before you resurface the pit lane.

Paulie: Well okay then. I guess.

Tommy Angelo: Lets go, champ.

[They get in the car. Tommy takes Paulie home.]

Paulie: You did real good today Tommy. With the... the driving. I was right. I was right when I found you. You know what I said?

Tommy Angelo: What did you say Paulie?

Paulie: I said - this guy can drive Don Salieri. This is a guy who can drive.

Tommy Angelo: And here we are.

Paulie: Here we are. Right here, that's where we are. You put me to shame Tom. Look at you, now you're even a... some kinda racecar driver.

Tommy Angelo: We all got our...

Paulie: You're doing real good since you joined the family - but you know you got it easy - right? Me and Sam, we keep the real stuff from you.

Tommy Angelo: That right, huh?

Paulie: You don't know what it's like! You get the call to see the Don and your minds racing. I've done some bad shit, Tom.

Tommy Angelo: We're all in this together. I do what the Don asks, when he asks it - just like you.

Paulie: You're like me. You can't just shut it down. Blank it out like Sam does. Go home to... whoever the hell he goes home to.

Tommy Angelo: Paulie, you're drunk. You're gonna have to clam up, for your own sakes.

Paulie: Yeh. You're right. You're right. Tom! I wanna get with a lady.

Tommy Angelo: Uh, I'm not helping you with that today.

Paulie: Take me to the ladies! Take me to the Blue Tropics!

Tommy Angelo: I dunno, I oughta take you home.

Paulie: The bridge! Take the bridge over to the island! Take me to the ladies! Take me to those sweet patooties.

Tommy Angelo: I dunno. Takin' you home seems... more classy.

Paulie: Alright! Now we're talking oh boy - you should see these dames Tom!

Tommy Angelo: I leave it to you to swim with barracudas Paulie. You're gonna have to tell me where the hell I'm drivin'.

Paulie: You don't know?

Tommy Angelo: I don't know.

Paulie: It's… there's a blue sign?

Tommy Angelo: Gonna need more than that.

Paulie: There's a blue sign, and it says ‘Blue Tropics’ and it's right near the docks.

Tommy Angelo: Figures. Check a map or something.

Paulie: Ahhh, home? You brought me home? Maybe. Maybe that's... yeh. A good idea. Yeh. Okay I'm gonna...

Tommy Angelo: Sweet dreams, tough guy.

Paulie: I'm gonna... yeh… I don't feel so good.

Chapter 6: Sarah (1932)
Luigi: Last call, Tom. You want anything else?

Tommy Angelo: Nah. I'm headin' home.

Luigi: Tommy, before you go, I ask maybe a small favor, huh?

Tommy Angelo: Sure, Luigi. What do you need?

Luigi: Walk my daughter home?

Tommy Angelo: Sarah? Way I hear it, she doesn't need any kind of escort...

Luigi: She's tough. But there's a pack of boys near her place, punks, you know? Cattivo ragazzi (bad boys), they talk blue. Make advances. Sarah, she gonna speak the mind. But maybe she says something they don't like, things get ugly. But if you're walking her home? This'll remind those punks that she's the Don's goddaughter.

Tommy Angelo: No problem, Luigi. I'd be honored.

Luigi: Mm, bene. Sarah! Time to close!

[Sarah comes out of the back room with a box covered with a towel.]

Sarah: What's this then?

Luigi: Tom, Tom is gonna take you home.

Sarah: That right?

Tommy Angelo: Hey, I just work here.

Luigi: Make sure nobody bother you.

Sarah: Fine. If it'll make you feel better, pop. (hugs him) I'll see you tomorrow. Let me get my coat.

Tommy Angelo: I'll wait for you outside. 

[Outside Tommy walks with Sarah.]

Tommy Angelo: You okay?

Sarah: I don't need anyone walking me home...

Tommy Angelo: Eh, we were talking about meeting up tonight anyway.

Sarah: I guess.

Tommy Angelo: And you can quit worrying about what he's gonna think.

Sarah: Not the point, Tom. He treats me like a kid sometimes.

Tommy Angelo: Eh, I get it. He's protective. He's seen things.

Sarah: We've all seen things.

Tommy Angelo: You know we've got to talk about you stealing food.

Sarah: Hey, I cook it, so I get to say where it goes.

Tommy Angelo: Paulie won't thank you.

Sarah: Well maybe tomorrow's finally gonna be the day he fixes his own breakfast. Could you knock on the door. Only got so many hands here.

[Tommy knocks at the door and a girl opens it.]

Juliet: Sarah! That for me?

Sarah: Yeah, though it's not as much as last time.

Juliet: It's enough. Nonna thinks you're an angel.

Sarah: The Don hates seeing food go to waste.

Juliet: And this... has got to be Tommy. Sarah told us all about you.

Tommy Angelo: That right?

Sarah: You're a famous race driver, Tom. Everyone talks about you.

Juliet: Yeah she's right. They do.

Sarah: Well anyways, don't let the cold in Juliet. I'll see you at church.

Juliet: Alright, have a great evening.

Tommy Angelo: Night!

Juliet: Bueno notte (Good night), Tommy. (closes the door) Hey Mamma! Your angel Sarah brought more food!

Tommy Angelo: It's nice you do that.

Sarah: That? Well... Lot of hungry people on this block.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. Well it's... err... it's a good night for a walk anyways.

[They are crossing the road. Tommy almost gets hit by a car.]

Sarah: Don't get yourself killed on my account Tom.

Tommy Angelo: I try to avoid it.

Sarah: That's all you got? You spend all this time with a ladykiller like Sam Trapani - and the best line you got is 'good night for a walk anyways'?

Tommy Angelo: Well it is ain't it?

Sarah: Yeah. I guess so.

Flower Salesman: Flowers for the lady signore?

Tommy Angelo: Nah, we're good.

Sarah: Now I don't get flowers?

Tommy Angelo: When you let me take you on a real date, and not some walk home for Luigi - then you get the flowers.

Sarah: Eh, that could happen - if pop's not gonna stop me seeing one of you. I think he knows anyway.

Tommy Angelo: Luigi? Nah.

Sarah: These guys have been creeps to me for weeks, but I didn't tell you as I know what you're like. I mention it to dad this one time, and all of a sudden he gets you to be my knight in shining armor. So yeah, he knows.

Tommy Angelo: Huh. Well like I say, means there's no problem with me.

Sarah: If he did, you wouldn't last long. I know what happened to all the other guys I dated. I help hide the bodies.

Tommy Angelo: Ah, so now we are...

Sarah: I've been tryin' to keep you safe Tommy Angelo. All this time.

Tommy Angelo: Let's go someplace tomorrow night maybe. The pictures maybe. You can get your flowers.

Sarah: That'd be good.

Billy: Oh! Hey there darlin'. You steppin' out on us?

Sarah: Piss off.

Billy: Ah, Hahaha, don't cast a kitten, dollface. We'll let your boyfriend watch, whaddaya say?

Tommy Angelo: We going to have trouble here?

Johnny: Trouble started back when you tried to steal our girl, chief.

Tommy Angelo: You saps aren't careful, you'll end up in wooden overcoats. Last chance to walk away.

Billy: We ain't frails. We know who you work for.

Johnny: Salieri might've been the big six when he was younger, but he's all washed up now. It's only a matter of time before Morello punches his ticket.

Tommy Angelo: I don't need Salieri or anyone else. Not for this.

Johnny: You hear this guy?

Billy: Then let's see what you got, cake-eater.

[Tommy teaches the punks a lesson.]

Tommy Angelo: Get away from her!

Punk: Nah. Nah I won't.

[Tommy defeats several punks, but one of them manages to grab Sarah. It distracts Tommy for a second and he is attacked by a muscular punk with a stick.]

Sarah: Tommy!

Large Punk: My turn now!

Tommy Angelo: Hope you're better than your friends. You made one hell of a mistake here today. That's what I got you son-of-a-bitch.

[After defeating the strongman, Tommy runs to Sarah.]

Sarah: Get away from me!

Tommy Angelo: Hey!

[Sarah elegantly pushes the scumbag away, and then Tommy punches him in the face.]

Sarah: You got a good right hook. I'll give you that. You're bleeding. Come up to my place. I'll take a look. 

[At Sarah’s apartment.]

Sarah: Well, you gonna come in and take a load off, or what?

Tommy Angelo: Been wondering when you'd invite me up.

Sarah: The banks closed, slugger. I'm just gonna patch you up is all. Now, go sit down on the couch and roll up your sleeve. I'm getting my sewing kit. Doesn't look too bad. You need somethin' for the pain?

Tommy Angelo: No. I'm fine.

Sarah: You don't have to do that.

Tommy Angelo: What?

Sarah: I can see it fuckin' hurts, Tom. You wanna pretend it don't, go ask Paulie to staple you up.

Tommy Angelo: What do you got?

[She pulls out a bottle of alcohol.]

Sarah: Compliments of the Don. Take another. Alright. You gonna grin and bear this?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah I'll be okay.

Sarah: Good. 'Cause I don't need the little old lady next door complainin' to the super about all the racket.

Tommy Angelo: Just be quick about it, will you?

Sarah: It's gonna take as long as it takes. The sloppier the stitch, the uglier the scar.

Tommy Angelo: That right? You stitched up a lot of fellas?

Sarah: Just my father. Ma' would really go at Luigi sometimes. He got pretty good at duckin' dinner plates, so one day she stabbed him with her knitting needle. Right through the hand.

Tommy Angelo: What for?

Sarah: 'Cause, she was an ugly, jealous drunk. There. Not my best work, but it'll hold.

Tommy Angelo: The scar will be somethin' to remember you by, if nothin' else.

Sarah: You're staying over. Can't have you stumblin' around the neighborhood pie-eyed. Not with them hoods out lookin' for you anyways.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, okay. You got an extra blanket or somethin'?

Sarah: No. And the heats out.

[She sits closer to him. Tommy puts his arm around her.]

Tommy Angelo: This'll do.

Chapter 7: Better Get Used To It (1932)
[The next day what happened in the evening comes to Don Salieri's attention. He gathers a meeting in his office.]

Don Salieri: This can't stand.

Tommy Angelo: Sarah's okay boss. I took care of it.

Don Salieri: She started working here before she could see over the bar. I don't have a daughter of my own, Tom. I'd do anything for Luigi's little girl.

Tommy Angelo: So would I. We all would.

Sam: That's right boss. Anything for Luigi and Sarah.

Paulie: Do those bastards think this is fuckin' Lunapark, or something? I'll rip 'em apart with my own hands.

Don Salieri: Our business is protection. But who is going to pay up when they learn that we can't even protect one of our own as she walks home from work?

Tommy Angelo: So, what do you want us to do?

Don Salieri: Teach these boys a lesson. Break every bone in their bodies. Put them in wheelchairs. Bust up their faces so bad, even their mothers can't look at them without screaming.

Sam: We know where they're holed up?

Frank: A friend on the force says we should start looking around in Chinatown.

Paulie: Then Big Biff will know something. Tommy, go to Vinny's and get us some gear and then meet me at Biff's place.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, okay.

Don Salieri: Leave those punks lying in the street. I want people to know that we don't allow mad dogs to run wild in our neighborhood.

Tommy Angelo: You got it boss.

[Tommy, Sam and Paulie leave the office.]

Paulie: Some of these sons-of-bitches could still be on our turf.

Sam: I'll check the neighborhood. Make sure they're gone while you see Bill.

Sam: Good hunting.

Paulie: Yeah, same. Okay, so when you're done with Vinny come find me in Chinatown.

Tommy Angelo: Sure.

Paulie: Let's go bust some heads.

[Tommy overhears the conversation standing outside Don's office.]

Frank: Everything is in hand… 

Don Salieri: Everything will be in hand once these guys' laces are beaten into the sidewalk!

[Tommy walks over to the bar.]

Luigi: If I were a young man these... men... would be under the bridge. Throats slit. Food for fish.

Tommy Angelo: We'll teach 'em respect. Don't worry.

Luigi: With you, I never worry. But... do not tell Sarah, this is not her affair. Not anymore.

Sarah: Wanna more food, Tom?

Tommy Angelo: Nah. The Don's gotta job for me someplace out of town.

Sarah: Don't worry about it. It'll keep till you're back.

[Tommy walks into Vincenzo's workshop.]

Vincenzo: Hey, hey! You here for some heaters, Tom?

Tommy Angelo: Nah, I'm already going in heeled. (pulls out his gun) Paulie and me, we gotta give a beating to some punks who've been on our turf. I don't wanna pull this, and piss in our own street. Something that busts heads, that's all we need.

Vincenzo: Sam turned over some guy's warehouse and...

[He pulls out three bats from behind the counter.]

Vincenzo: Autographed by Babe Ruth himself, the guy said. That's horse shit, but they bust heads. Your punks won't have time for questions.

Tommy Angelo: Nah, they won't. Thanks Vinny.

[He leaves the workshop, takes a motorcycle from the garage and goes to Chinatown.]

Paulie: About time. C'mon, I'm wet through. Why Biff moved into this dump I'll never know.

Tommy Angelo: Give him a break. He's in love.

Paulie: Nah, he caught yellow fever that time we boosted the Shanghai skin flicks.

Tommy Angelo: Well, I like her anyways.

Paulie: Problem with you, Tom. You're always soft with the dames.

[They walk into Biff's store.]

Paulie: Biff, you fat bastard! How are you doing?

Woman: (Speaking Cantonese)

Paulie: Dollface! Great to see you! Call her off, Bill. We got business.

Biff: Upstairs! Please?!

Woman: (Speaking Cantonese)

Biff: So. What's the beef?

Paulie: We need some information. Got some jokers causing trouble. They messed with Luigi's daughter.

Biff: Plenty of hoods around. You got any more?

Tommy Angelo: One of 'ems a weasel named Billy. Pals with a prissy chump and a bruiser with a bald head.

Biff: Right. I know 'em. They're set up in the old Service Station a block over. They hock some gear every now and then. Small-time.

Paulie: That's why I knew to come to you Bil. you're good with small-time.

Biff: Out the back, cross the street. You'll find them there.

Paulie: Thanks. See you around.

Biff: Hey Paulie... about that dough...

Paulie: Relax! Just waiting for my guy to come through. It'll be next week, just sit tight.

[He and Tommy leave the shop.]

Tommy Angelo: What was that back there? You and Bill got something going on?

Paulie: A guy I know is bringing in a shipment of suits. Classy ones. Mexican.

Tommy Angelo: You're getting suits from Mexico?

Paulie: No idiot. The suits are boosted from a lock up downtown. The tailor is from Mexico. Originally anyways, he lives in Holbrook.

Tommy Angelo: The Don know about this?

Paulie: Yeah, yeah—he'll get his cut. You just keep this under your hat.

Tommy Angelo: I guess I heard nothing.

Paulie: You gonna know these punks when you see em?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. Though I guess if I don't, all we gotta do is find the other guys in Chinatown who look like we do.

Paulie: There it is.

[They fit into the old factory.]

Paulie: So here's how we do this. I walk in and start beating people. You do the same. No shooters.

Tommy Angelo: You take long thinking that one up?

Paulie: Nah, this plan gets used a lot. I think we gotta go in through the side.

[Tommy kicks the metal door open with his foot. Meanwhile, unsuspecting punks stand around smoking.]

Johnny: I'm telling you… the nicest ass I've seen in my life.

Billy: Whoa, whoa...

Johnny: Billy, it's the guy from the other night.

Billy: We gotta go!

[Billy and Johnny run away. Paulie smacks the third member of the gang with a bat and knocks him out. Without delay, he and Tommy move on, chasing the others.]

Punk: Help me over here!

Punk: He's there!

Billy: We got trouble!

Paulie: This! Is! Why! You! Don't! Mess! With! Us!

Punk: Gut him!

Punk: Let's do this!

Punk: Can't run from us!

Paulie: Come on! Before they move! C'mon!

Punk: Jesus...

Punk: He's mine!

Punk: Gonna lay you out.

Punk: Holy...

Paulie: Over the fence Tom, before they get away.

Johnny: Don't let them get Billy!

[The punks turn out to be armed...]

Paulie: Get your ass behind something!

Billy: You're gonna die here! You know that?!

Paulie: Get your gat, Tom. He made it serious!

Tommy Angelo: You think I need telling?! I go north, you go south.

Paulie: What?

Tommy Angelo: I go up, you go through there.

Paulie: Okay - sure!

Johnny: Billy, we gotta go! Now!

Billy: Run! Go!

Thug: Ya mine!

Thug: Move to their side!

Paulie: C'mon you punks! Holy shit! Clear a path to Billy, Tom! We get to that punk through all the other punks! Take 'em down!

Punk: I shoulda finished you last night!

Paulie: They got a new guy givin' back-up! Shotgun! Watch your ass! First aid here...

Billy: Get everyone here! Everyone! Take those guys out!

Johnny: They are serious! Put 'em in the ground!

Paulie: You started this! Not us! They called in the rest of their crew! Sorry pal… Grenade! Get down!

Thug: Linin' up a shot!

Thug: Get them OFF me!

Thug: Ya mine!

Paulie: Tommy! Look out! Gotta reload!

[After killing all the thugs, Paulie and Tommy go outside. Johnny and Billy are already in the car, getting ready to leave.]

Billy: Johnny! Get down!

Johnny: Get us out of here!

Paulie: Shit! We gotta get to the car, Tom. 

[They run up to the first car they see. Paulie points his gun at the driver, standing on the street with a cigarette in his teeth.]

Paulie: Scram! C'mon! We can't lose them! When you throw a grenade you throw It FAR AWAY. Jesus CHRIST. Go careful Tom—the road's a river.

Tommy Angelo: Don't worry. I got this.

Paulie: You ever seen guys piss their pants this quick? If you look through the rain you can see it dripping out the back of their car. C'mon c'mon! We can't let 'em get away! These guys are doing to regret they ever set us up with Sarah, huh?

[Trying to get away from the chase, Billy crashes into a pole. Johnny is lying unconscious, covered in blood, probably dead. Tommy and Paulie walk slowly toward them.]

Paulie: Dumb son of a bitch just wrecked himself… Well, they're not walking away from that. Go on and pop him, Tom.

Billy: No... no, no wait… please… I don't wanna fuckin' die…

[Seeing that Tommy hesitates, Paulie kills Billy himself.]

Paulie: Christ, Tom, you can't feel sorry for these animals. A guy like this, would plug you if you give him the chance. You gotta pull the trigger without thinkin’.

[He shoots Johnny's body to make sure he is killed. Paulie wants to shoot again, but he runs out of ammunition.]

Paulie: Guess I'm out. But this one's finished too.

[He takes a pack of cigarettes out of Johnny's pocket and lights one up. The cigarettes turn out to be good. Paulie throws the pack to Tommy, but he doesn't pay attention and the pack just falls into a puddle.]

Paulie: Ah Christ, Tom. Snap outta it. Remember what those guys wanted to do to Sarah?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah... I just...

Paulie: Hey. Let's get outta here before the bulls show up, huh?

Chapter 8: The Saint and the Sinner (1932)
[Paulie and Sam play cards in Salieri's office. Paulie thinks he has won and already takes the money, but Sam declares in the voice of a serial killer…]

Sam: Simple straight.

Paulie: I can't afford this life no more.

Sam: Just getting lucky. I'll give you a chance to win your money back,

[The Don and Frank enter.]

Paulie: You want in, boss?

Frank: We have business to discuss, Paulie.

Don Salieri: We're in it now, boys.

Frank: One of our associates at the coroner's office sent this over. Corpse's name is Ghillotti. (throws a photo on the table)

Don Salieri: You recognize him?

Tommy Angelo: Sure. That's one of the punks we ran out of the neighborhood.

Don Salieri: You know how he got the bullet in the back of his head?

Paulie: Yeah. We capped him.

Tommy Angelo: Cops oughta thank us. We did 'em a favor. The guy was a rapist, boss.

Don Salieri: Yeah, well, he was also a city councillor's son. You want to drive a politician into Morello's arms, there's no better way than killing off his family.

Tommy Angelo: Christ...

Frank: It gets worse. You left another guy in the wreck?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. He was dead when we got there.

Paulie: You going to tell me he's the President's nephew or something?

Don Salieri: Two in the head, Paulie. If you're going to do a job, do it right.

Tommy Angelo: He made it?

Frank: Yes. He spent the week at St. Mary's, but he pulled through.

Don Salieri: Can he point a finger at either of you?

Tommy Angelo: I don't know. Maybe.

Don Salieri: Okay, look, we're going to kill two birds with one blast. Ghillotti's funeral is today at St. Michael's. Sam, you're going to attend. Sit in the back and try to spot the lucky bastard.

Sam: How will I recognize him?

Paulie: He'll be the one who just crawled away from car wreck.

Frank: His arm is broken. Look for a sling.

Don Salieri: Sam's gonna need a little distraction if he's going to clean up your mess.

Paulie: You sending Tommy to dip his wick?

Tommy Angelo: It's a brothel?

Frank: A gentlemen's club just down the street from St. Michael's. The Don has invested a lot of money in it over the years.

Paulie: So have me an' Sam.

Frank: Regardless, the owner has suddenly decided to do business with Mr. Morello instead of us.

Tommy Angelo: You want me to go remind him of his obligations?

Don Salieri: Yes. Then blow the place up.

Tommy Angelo: What?

Don Salieri: If Morello wants to take businesses away from us, he'll inherit craters.

Frank: Look Tom, we can't send Paulie and Sam, since all the ladies know them already. They'd never make it through the front door. But you can walk right in.

Tommy Angelo: Okay. What about the manager?

Don Salieri: Take care of him wherever you find him. If any of the whores see it, well, it'll be a warning. Once he's out of the way, head to his office on the top floor. Grab any documents and money you find there, and place the explosives.

Frank: Vincenzo will see that you have what you need.

Sam: And you think the blast will be big enough to give me cover?

Don Salieri: Yeah, but be smart. Only take a shot if you know you won't get made.

Frank: Tommy, there's one more thing. One of the girls is passing Morello Information about our operations. Before you blow the place, you'll need to take care of her too.

Sam: You Want Tommy to kill a twist? C'mon Frank...

Don Salieri: It's just bad luck this falls to Tom. But we gotta protect the family.

Frank: Her name's Michelle. She's usually working one of the upper rooms. Her photo is in the folder.

Don Salieri: You boys clear on everything?

[Sam looks at the photo of Michelle and replies with a bit of sadness in his voice.]

Sam: Yeah.

Don Salieri: Tom?

Tommy Angelo: I got it, boss.

Don Salieri: Then get it done.

[Sam and Tommy leave the office.]

Sam: C'mon. Let's go. Go see Vinny. I'll meet you here.

Gangster: You hear they're buryin' the Ghilotti kid today?

Gangster: Yeah. They better bury him deep.

Gangster: Why?

Gangster: Guys we rub out have started getting back up. That's why.

NEWSPAPER-NOV 19TH 1932
COUNCILLOR SON IS SLAIN
William 'Billy' Ghillotti, son of LH City Council president Roberto Ghillotti, was found dead by firearm-inflicted wounds this past Sunday. The body was discovered by police officers investigating reports of a wrecked automobile. There is presently no suspect or even a clear motive for this senseless murder, which bears all the hallmarks of a gangland execution.

Sarah: You lose your card game?

Tommy Angelo: Something like that.

Sarah: Come by mine once you finish up today if it's not too late.

Luigi: I heard about our... misfortune. Tom.

Tommy Angelo: We're gonna fix it.

Luigi: A lesson learned I think.

[Tommy goes to Vinny’s workshop.]

Vincenzo: Heard you were in the market for somethin' that goes boom. Give those girls a squeeze from Uncle Vin, huh?

Tommy Angelo: Not today Vinny.

Vincenzo: You remember when the Corleone hotel was a classy joint? The cathouse you're goin' to has been headed downhill since ‘29, though I guess the girls are still pretty.

[Tommy goes out of the workshop and comes to the car near which Sam is waiting for him.]

Sam: We have to talk. Get in. Don't go anyplace yet. You've gotta hear me out on this… It's about the girl...

Tommy Angelo: Michelle?

Sam: Right. You don't have to rub her out, just make her disappear.

Tommy Angelo: You know her?

Sam: ...yeah. I've been with her a few times. She's a good egg. Tom. Just maybe not so bright she doesn't deserve to get plugged just because she like listening to me talks.

Tommy Angelo: You think she’ll leave town?

Sam: When she understands what happens otherwise? Yeah, she'll leave. Here's a hundred. Give to her. Make sure she gets far away.

Tommy Angelo: Okay Sam. I see what I can do.

Sam: That's all I'm asking. Now let's go.

[Tommy takes to the street.]

Tommy Angelo: Michelle. She's the one from the race track, right?

Sam: Tom, that was the last time we're ever gonna talk about her. Ever. I've told you what I had to ask, and you listened. Got to leave it there.

Tommy Angelo: Okay.

Sam: Keep your head when you get into the hotel. Find your mark and don't act suspicious. The manager thinks he's untouchable, you can probably walk right up to him.

Tommy Angelo: Anything else I should know?

Sam: Nah just don't take all day. Ghilotti died young so there can't be much to say about him. When the bomb goes off, I'll do my thing.

Tommy Angelo: Got it.

Sam: What kinda world is it that you screw up and get sent to a cathouse, while I have to clean up your mess at a funeral. You see justice in that?

Tommy Angelo: I see a job I gotta do.

Sam: Such a professional. Just try to finish the job this time, huh? First time I've been to church in a while.

Tommy Angelo: (smiles) Gonna guess they're still singing the same songs.

Sam: Last time I went it was. Same songs I always heard as a kid.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. You remot... the religious type.

Sam: It's the funerals Tom. That's all it ever is. All that anyone ever wants to do is point guns at the family and shoot. Came a point there were so many funerals I just stopped goin’ to most of 'em. They're boring as all hell.

Tommy Angelo: That's a shame. Seein' as you're always dressed for the occasion.

Sam: Great gag Tom. Write that one down.

Tommy Angelo: Thanks. I'll do that.

Sam: Now weddings... Weddings are less boring. I'd go to one of them. You workin' on that?

Tommy Angelo: Uh, guess so.

Sam: Good. 'Cause I've given up waitin' on Paulie, Guy couldn't get a broad to stick to him if they went swimmin' through glue.

Tommy Angelo: Ah, he'll find someone.

Sam: Tom. If his own mother has given up hope then you can give up hope too.

[Tommy drive up to St. Michael’s Church.]

Tommy Angelo: Here's your stop.

Sam: I’ll give the family your condolences.

Tommy Angelo: Good luck.

Sam: You too.

[Tommy drives to the luxurious Corleone Hotel.]

Doorman: You behave yourself in here, okay?

Tommy Angelo: Know where I can find the manager?

Doorman: I just watch the door pal.

Prostitute: Hey handsome… You here for a girl, drinks - or a mix of the two?

Tommy Angelo: A girl. And I got some business with ya manager too.

Prostitute: A girl, I can help you with. Come through… Find a girl you like and you can both get better acquainted upstairs. There's no rush so get a drink, relax and enjoy yourself...

Receptionist: Good afternoon, sir.

Prostitute: Ooh, just how I like 'em… Why don't you buy me a drink?

Tommy Angelo: Because you're not the dame I'm after. You know Michelle?

Prostitute: I'm new here baby, I don't know a thing.

Prostitute 2: We can just talk if you don't want anythin' else - we can do whatever you want. What's a handsome fella like you doin' in a place like this?

Tommy Angelo: Lookin' for a girl named Michelle.

Prostitute 2: She's busy upstairs, but I'm free… 

Prostitute 3: I can tell you're nervous, but I can step you through what we gotta do...

Tommy Angelo: I'm looking for Michelle. Know her?

Prostitute 3: Yeah, she's the popular one. Book yourself in with the guy at reception. You've got to get in line for Michelle.

Tommy Angelo: I need to speak to Michelle.

Brothel-Maman: The only girls available are the girls you can see. Find one you like, and don't make a fuss.

Tommy Angelo: I need to talk to the manager.

Bartender: Head straight through to the lounge. You're with our new business partners I assume?

Receptionist: You get a room when you get a guy. Not before.

Prostitute: Fine.

Receptionist: You know the rules, Dottie...

Tommy Angelo: Is Michelle in today?

Receptionist: Let me check… She's in, but she's busy.

Prostitute: You looking for a good time? Come this way sweetie....

Tommy Angelo: Nah, I'm lookin' for a friend. Michelle.

Prostitute: Sure you are. Come to my room and tell me all about her.

[Tommy follows the prostitute.]

Tommy Angelo: I just wanna talk.

Prostitute: Y'know, I get to hear that a lot. I bet you're not like all the other guys either, are you?

Tommy Angelo: Nah, not really.

Prostitute: So we talking or what?

Tommy Angelo: Where's Michelle?

Prostitute: Upstairs in 208. That all you want?

Tommy Angelo: That's all I want.

Prostitute: (sighs) Wish they were all like you, sweetheart.

[Tommy tries to find Room 208 and checks out every room.]

Bouncer: You treat women like this!? You'd treat your mother like this?

Client: No! Please!

Prostitute: You don't like it when it's doled out to you do you?

Client: I'm sorry! I didn't mean it.

Bouncer: You meant it when you did it you prick!

Prostitute: Fuck him up Charlie.

HOTEL CALLING CARD
CORLEONE HOTEL
Nice Rooms. Splendid Furniture. Warm Welcome. Good Company.
Telephone: Downtown 1702 to arrange appointment.
Michelle, Room 208.

[Finally Tommy finds room 208 and kicks the door open. A frightened, half-naked Michelle sits down on the bed.]

Michelle: Ahh! Ahh! Get out! Get the hell out!

[She throws a vase at him, but to no meaningful result.]

Tommy Angelo: (threatening) You Michelle?

Michelle: (in tears) What's it to you?

Tommy Angelo: Fella named Sam is one of your regulars?

Michelle: Maybe. There's a lotta guys named Sam.

Tommy Angelo: You know him. Works for Don Salieri. Maybe you got him talkin' about our business from time to time. And maybe Don Morello offered you some money to spill what you heard?

Michelle: No... Sam trusts me... I… I don't say nothin', he knows that.

Tommy Angelo: (puts his gun to her head) Well, The Don's losin' a lot of money because someone can't keep their mouth shut.

Michelle: (hysterical) I was just bumpin' gums with some of Morello's girls! I didn't mean nothin' by it. Tell him I'm sorry! Tell the Don I won't never open my mouth again!

Tommy Angelo: Shh... I know.

Michelle: I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

Tommy Angelo: You scared, then? Good. Don't you ever forget how it feels to be this scared. To know you're just one twitch away from a hole in the ground. Because if you ever show your face in this town again, they're gonna find you with two in the head. Do you understand?

[Michelle nods.]

Tommy Angelo: Lucky for you, Sam's got a big heart. (throws her the money) Get dressed and make tracks. This place is gonna blow soon.

Michelle: Thank you.

Tommy Angelo: Just don't come back, and we're square.

[She runs away with a wad of money in her hands and in her underwear.]

MANAGER'S NOTE
Michelle,
You're in room 208 all day tomorrow with Morello's guys. I'll be downstairs in the lounge sending them up.
They get what they want and as much as they want it. You complain: you lose your place. There's plenty more girls like you.
Come up to my office on the top floor in that gold negligee I liked so much if you feel like changing my mind.

[Tommy goes down to the hotel lobby and enters the room where the person is resting. She is just in time for the end of a speech given by the hotel manager.]

Manager: The friendship between the Corleone Hotel and the Morello family will be long, and fruitful! 

Employee 1: Who's these new guys gettin' the run of the place?

Employee 2: The manager havin' to play nice with his new friends.

Employee 1: How come?

Employee 2: As when your new friends turn up with tommy guns, that's what you do

Employee 3: Take off, pal.

Manager: (to Tommy) Uh… can I help you? Ah, good riddance…

[Tommy tries to sneak into the kitchen, but the cook throws him out the door…]

Cook: Not stopping 'til I find you… You need ta leave. Next time wa don't get to walk away!

Manager: If you want a girl, head back to the bar. They'll come over and keep you entertained.

[Finding no better way, Tommy simply takes a gun out of his pocket and shoots the manager in the head at point-blank range… This is where the real chaos begins!]

Employee: Get him!

Cook: Say goodnight punk.

Guard: Got 'em!

Guard: Back me up!

Guard: Got ya now!

Guard: We're gonna throw some lead!

Guard: Gonna end this guy.

Guard: On me!

Guard: Comin' for ya!

Guard: Yaaargh!

Guard: There!

Guard: Over here!

Guard: Got ya now!

Guard: Take him out!

[Tommy runs to the manager's office. Since he is still not well versed in the layout of the huge hotel, he has to check almost every door. In one of the rooms, he finds a clown in his underpants tied to a chair.]

Clown: It is not what it looks like.

[Finally, Tommy finds the manager’s office. He looks around.]

LETTER TO FRANK
Dear Mr Colletti,
I must apologize for missing our regular appointment last week. I had urgent family matters to attend to at short notice.
It is with some regret that I write to confirm the termination of our agreement. Mr Salieri has been a wonderful business partner over the years. I am most grateful for his support and your wise counsel.
Please find with this missive a return of Mr Salieri's investment, along with a hundred dollars as a gesture of goodwill.
Our doors are always open, we remember our friends here at the Corleone.
Yours cordially,

Manager, Corleone Hotel

[Tommy places a bomb under the manager's desk, then looks out the window - a car with thugs has pulled up to the building...]

Tommy Angelo: Shit…

[He goes out into the corridor and sees that they are already waiting for him...]

Tommy Angelo: Damn it…

[Tommy opens the window and sees that he can't jump out, it's too high...]

Tommy Angelo: Jesus…

[Still, he decides to jump, but not down, but to the neighboring roof, although such a jump is also not easy, but there is simply no other choice.]

Tommy Angelo: Ahh…

[To decide to take such a step he is helped by... explosion. Tommy is simply thrown onto another roof. When Tommy comes to his senses, he hides behind the railing - the thugs are already peeking out of the windows wanting to kill him.]

Dispatch: (via radio) Gunfire and... an explosion... reported at the Corleone hotel. Suspect is escaping over the rooftops.

Policeman: Spread out! Find him! Italian-looking male. Six foot and then some! He just shot the Corleone to pieces!

Dispatch: (via radio) I want everyone we've got on this guy. Get up there, and bring him down.

Policeman: He's up here with us! There on the roof with us!

Policeman: Thought you'd get by didn't you! Didn't think we'd be here to meet you, huh?! Got him! There! Get him!

Policeman: ...help me up… somebody help me… over here...

[Tommy goes to the next roof with a ladder and then removes it. He walks down the stairs into the main hall where a priest reads a requiem for the recently murdered Johnny.]

Dispatch: (via radio) No contact with the fellas on the roof. Feels like we lost him.

Priest: No matter how far we've fallen, we can find redemption in death. Now William, he was a sinner, yes, but he was also a loving son, a protective brother, and a loyal friend. And for those virtues, we pray that his soul finds salvation. And now, I believe one of Billy's closest and dearest friends would like to say a few words.

Johnny: Thank you Father. I uh... I just wanted to pay my respects… Billy. I never said this, but I considered you my brother. I can't even count all the times you saved my ass from a beatin'. Don't know how I could --

[At this point, Tommy walks out the door.]

Priest: What are you doing.

Johnny: Wait... That's the guy! That's the guy who killed Billy!

[Tommy hides behind the altar.]

Gangster: Get down! Over here! How dare you come in here?! Got ya now!

Gangster: Found him! Down there! Shoot him before he comes up the stairs!

Gangster: Let's make some noise!

Johnny: (from afar) You interrupt his funeral and you think you're better than us?

Tommy Angelo: You could have stopped all this days ago!

Johnny: (from afar) His father was here, his mother!

Tommy Angelo: This is the way this city works!

Gangster: There! Up on the balcony!

Priest: This is a church! A house of God! Stop! End this! Please! Please! This solves nothing!

Tommy Angelo: You think I'm enjoying this?!

[Tommy catches up with Johnny and injures him.]

Priest: What have you done? Murder in the house of God...

Tommy Angelo: These men were criminals, Father. Thieves, rapists, killers.

Priest: And God would have embraced them, if they'd asked for forgiveness. Now, which one of these men might have sought redemption by working with the poor? Which one might have saved just one life?

[Johnny comes out with a pistol in his hands.]

Johnny: None of us, Father. (to Tommy) You bastard. If you have any confessions to make, you'd better do it quick.

Priest: No more bloodshed, please!

Johnny: I'm sorry, Father. Consider this an act of divine retribution.

[He prepares to shoot Tommy, but then Sam shows up and shoots Johnny in the head without any hesitation then shoots him again. The priest with blood stains on his face stands there in shock.]

Sam: That make us even?

Tommy Angelo: Sure. For now.

[He throws a wad of cash on the floor.]

Tommy Angelo: For your trouble, Father.

Priest: I don't want your blood money.

Tommy Angelo: You took theirs. Not a lot of difference from where I'm standing. That should be enough dough to patch up the bullet holes, and keep you quiet.

Sam: When the cops come, you tell them the gunmen who did this had East Coast accents. Must've been from outta town, right?

Priest: I won't lie. But I won't say anything at all.

Sam: Good. It'd be a shame if we had to come back here.

[Tommy follows Sam.]

Tommy Angelo: And where the hell were you?

Sam: Soon as I walked into the church their crew recognized me - followed me straight back out.

Tommy Angelo: Where are they now?

Sam: The same place as all these guys, Come on, we gotta go!

[They go out on the street, however... The church is already surrounded by police.]

Sam: In the hearse! Let's go!

Tommy Angelo: Are you kidding?

Sam: It's got wheels don't?! We can run find another sure but we got cops everywhere!

Dispatch: (via radio) Suspect and accomplice escaping in a hearse. I repeat: a hearse.

Tommy Angelo: Well today didn't turn out like I expected.

Sam: Just drive, or we'll end up in the back! Whatever you did at the cathouse got the cops plenty pissed!

Tommy Angelo: Yeh, it was messy - but I got everything done.

Sam: Everything?

Tommy Angelo: Yeh. Everything.

Dispatch: (via radio) Cars reported him in North Park.

Tommy Angelo: They giving up yet?

Sam: Don't think so.

Tommy Angelo: They must've called out every cop in the city.

Sam: Come on Tommy! Lose 'em!

Tommy Angelo: I'm trying!

Dispatch: (via radio) He's gone. Go back to patrols. We'll get him next time.

Sam: Okay we lost them.

Tommy Angelo: Thank Christ.

Sam: Going to be tryin' to forget today for a long time...

Tommy Angelo: You're telling me...

Sam: Let's get back to the bar. We gotta lie low.

Tommy Angelo: Way this all went down, we gotta lie low for weeks.

Sam: Ah, the priest'll keep his trap shut, don't worry. Morello got a bloody nose, and you and Paulie are in the clear for whacking Ghillotti's son. Boss'll be pleased.

[They arrive at the restaurant and stop at the garage.]

Tommy Angelo: Thanks again Sam, for helping me out back there. I thought my time was up.

Sam: It's not anything you wouldn't do for me.

Tommy Angelo: I know but when you come that close to biting it... Christ. It's some thing. 

Sam: Don't need to tell me about that. Just don't think about it. Best lesson I could ever teach you: don't think about anything.

Intermezzo (Interlude) (1938)
Detective Norman: Jesus Christ, Tommy, you're confessin' to a shootout in a church.

Tommy Angelo: And I ain't even to the hard stuff yet.

Detective Norman: You know I could take you in right now and put you behind bars until you're old and gray.

Tommy Angelo: Maybe, if you think you could make any of it stick. But, then you'd never know about Morello.

Second Waitress: Hey fellas, sorry to keep you waitin', my shift just started. What you havin’?

Detective Norman: Two lunch specials, please. And more coffee. You know what? Just bring the whole pot.

[Tommy lights a cigarette.]

Detective Norman: Alright, we've come this far together. What kinda heat did you get from the church?

Tommy Angelo: That's the strange thing... Nothin' really came of it all. Always figured Salieri paid off someone somewhere, because it wasn't even in the papers. We just had to lay low for seven, eight months. The cops kept showin' up at the bar just to remind us they were watchin'. And Frank caught wind that Morello was helpin' Ghilotti get re-elected, hopin' he'd go after the Don.

Detective Norman: We recovered some account books from Morello's offices. ‘33 was a pretty good year for him.

Tommy Angelo: Bastard knew we were bleedin' out before we did... While we were busy keeping our heads down, he started movin' in on our rackets. Quiet at first. A few trucks go missin'. A top earner has one too many highballs, drives off a bridge. One of our regular pick ups suddenly closes up shop, moves upstate.

Detective Norman: And you didn't catch on?

Tommy Angelo: Not me. I think maybe Paulie smelled somethin'... But even with the cops lookin’ over our shoulders and Morello circlin', we were still makin' good money. And with the Don worried about keepin' the heat off, we didn't have much to do except drink, have a few laughs. And every time I went into Salieri's, there was Sarah. So, it was a good year. Until Frank...

Detective Norman: Coletti? The Don's consigliere?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. That's right. He set me straight. He set us all straight…

[We jump back to ‘32. Tommy drives Frank.]

Frank: There's a lot of buzz around town about you guys.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, we got into a little scrap last night, it's no big deal.

Frank: I don't care about the bar fight, Tom. I care how it looks when you walk into a club and buy everyone around.

Tommy Angelo: Ah, we gotta do something with our dough.

Frank: Then blow it at the track on Sunday. Or take a dame to a show. Or invest it, for Christ's sake.

Tommy Angelo: (laughs) You want me to become one of those Wall Street boys?

Frank: (strict) Don't sass me, Tommy. I'm trying to teach you the ropes so you don't get strangled by them. You ever have a dog, Tom?

Tommy Angelo: Sure. Little mutt, when I was a kid.

Frank: When I was eight or nine, before I came over from Sicily, I had this beautiful skinny Cirneco dell'Etna. Like a little greyhound... Fastest dog you've ever seen. That's how I met the Don. We started setting up races together, betting on her with coins and rifle shells. There wasn't another dog that could catch her. She never lost. Until the day she did. We were only out a pocket knife, but I never saw the Don so angry.

Tommy Angelo: She got old on you?

Frank: No. Pregnant. She went into heat, got out of the yard, and every dog in town had a turn. You're like that dog. Tommy. Every time you flash your money around, you're a bitch in heat and everyone in that club is now looking to fuck you. And once you get fucked, you're no good to us. Do you understand?

Tommy Angelo: You made your point.

Frank: Good, because you need to think about your career here. Look Paulie's hit his ceiling. He's the guy we want in a tussle, but he's not smart enough to run anything. Sam is loyal, but, he has no vision. But you, Tommy, you could run this town someday.

Tommy Angelo: I appreciate that, Frank. So, what happened to the dog?

Frank: The Don tried to drown her. I broke his nose. You can let me off here.

[Tommy pulls the car over.]

Frank: Give Sarah my best, Tommy.

Chapter 9: A Trip To The Country (1933)
[Tommy walks in the rain down the street.]

Tommy Angelo: (offscreen) Back then, everything went through Frank. The plans, the orders, the money. You could get the call day or night.

[He walks into Salieri's restaurant.]

Luigi: Ah Tommy. Frank says to wait for him in the garage out in the back. You got a job I think.

Tommy Angelo: Thanks Luigi. Sarah's cooking. She's bringing something over.

Luigi: In this rain? Ah, she's a good girl.

Tommy Angelo: I'll see you tomorrow Luigi.

Luigi: You know, it's good to see a smile back on Sarah's face.

NOTE FROM FRANK
Luigi,
Sarah loaned these books to March. Please return them, with our thanks.
Frank

TELEGRAM FROM CANADIANS
Received at 318 South St, Lost Heaven, 4321. 01 FEB 9 AM
CONFIRMING VISIT AS PLANNED CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN YOUR CANUCK COUSINS.

[Tommy goes out into the backyard.]

Gangster 1: You remember a night like this?

Gangster 2: Sure. Back in the day, when the boss was still with Peppone, we got called out to a hit. Some politician on the take. This storm's just raging, and we're driving out to the burbs to cap this guy. Street lights weren't so good, so we're driving in the dark. We get to the house and we're about to make our move, then there's this lightning flash - and for a split second in the front yard... I see this head. Just sittin' there. Starin'. Cut off at the neck.

Gangster 1: Nah, this ain't true!

Gangster 2: Some other crew had already been out to the house that night. Guess the guy had more than his share of enemies. They never found the body.

Gangster 1: Bullshit.

Gangster 2: God's truth. Hey, Tommy. You good?

Tommy Angelo: Yeh. Wet, but good.

[Tommy lights a cigarette. Frank walks up to him with an umbrella in his hands.]

Frank: Thanks for waiting, Tom. The Don and I had to go over last month's numbers again.

Tommy Angelo: Sure. So, what's the job?

Frank: I want you to help Sam and Paulie with a shipment we've got coming in tonight.

Tommy Angelo: The good stuff?

Frank: Straight from Canada.

Tommy Angelo: Where do you need me?

Frank: Sam's gone to meet our friends from the North at a farm outside of town. Paulie will oversee the trucks bringing the shipment into the city. But I want you to go with him. Be an extra pair of eyes. Make sure it all goes smoothly.

Tommy Angelo: Okay.

Frank: Get a car from Ralphie and meet Paulie at the warehouse. He's got heaters, in case you run into any trouble.

Tommy Angelo: Sure Frank. No problem.

Frank: Good. Now bring the Canadian home safe, Tommy. There's already a case earmarked for the Don.

[Tommy walks into the garage.]

Tommy Angelo: Workin' late Ralphie?

Ralphie: I s-sleep when F-Frank sleeps. Man, he's been w-workin us hard.

Tommy Angelo: Morello's takin' bites outta business everywhere else Ralph. Booze racket's where we shine. Gotta stay ahead someplace.

Ralphie: Ah, well... I-I just f-fix the cars T-Tom. I changed the p-plates again. C-can't be too careful.

Tommy Angelo: See you in the morning.

Ralphie: Okay. If the s-s-storm don't b-blow through I think I'm just g-gonna sleep here tonight.

[Tommy visits Vincenzo’s workshop.]

Vincenzo: (sleeping on his chair) Get outta... filthy... punk…

[Tommy takes some equipment, sits in the car and goes to Salieri’s Warehouse. Paulie is already there. He's sitting behind the wheel of the truck.]

Paulie: C'mon, Tom!

[Tommy gets into the truck.]

Paulie: Hey! Hey! Watch it, pal! I just dried out.

Tommy Angelo: Sorry. 

[The truck starts moving. This time Paulie is driving it.]

Tommy Angelo: You know this place?

Paulie: Uh, yeah. We've done a few pickups at the farm before. Don't worry, there ain't nothin' but cow shit and shine out here. It's gonna be an easy few clams. Boys will load up the trucks, and we'll come straight back.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, let's make it quick. I got someplace to be.

Paulie: Ah, you seein' Sarah later? Luigi's little girl your nightshift? You're something else, pal. Protectin' the girl's virginity one day, and takin' it the next.

Tommy Angelo: Lay off. Paulie.

Paulie: Ah, c'mon. I'm just kidding. She's a good girl. You settle down, she'll straighten you right out. I'm goin' home to a couch. Ha. I wonder what kinda stories she could tell about her old man, though. Luigi was a stone cold killer back in the day.

Tommy Angelo: I wouldn't know.

Paulie: Y'know she's been helping out behind the bar since she was a kid? I bet she's seen and heard a few things. Probably knows more about our business than we do.

Tommy Angelo: She knows enough not to ask me too many questions.

Paulie: That's good. She won't ever make a liar out of you. Christ, you oughta marry her just for that. 

[Paulie pulls the truck over.]

Paulie: Ah, dammit. Sam should be waitin' here, but I don't see him.

Tommy Angelo: Somethin' smells off.

Paulie: Don't let your pecker get all shrivelled up. Probably just tryin' to get outta the rain. Or into the bootleg. (presses the buzzer) That'll wake him.

Tommy Angelo: He ain't coming.

Paulie: Okay. Let's go find him.

[They leave the truck.]

Paulie: If that bastard is just three sheets and I'm wreckin' a new suit for nothin', I swear I'm gonna kill him.

[He pulls out a shotgun and holds it out to Tommy.]

Paulie: Here, just in case Frank was right. I'm gonna go grab them boys, get 'em sorted out. You go ahead, see what's what. We'll catch up with you.

[Tommy walks in the pouring rain and enters a small cabin.]

Tommy Angelo: Someone's been waiting here tonight...

NEWSPAPER - FEB 2ND 1933
ONE QUARTER OUT OF WORK
GOVERNMENT REPORT SHOWS NO END TO SLOWDOWN. Measures to date have failed to halt economic slide. Unemployment stands at 25%. Farm foreclosures are at a two-year high, as smallholders battle the combined threat of financial hardship and the dust storms choking the High Plains. In response, the President proposes new legislation to stabilize the banking system.

[Tommy continues to explore the surroundings of the farm.]

Tommy Angelo: Guy we pay to keep this place in check, don't even pretend to farm now… Place is derelict.

[Helena: find a dead dog, lying on the ground.]

Tommy Angelo: What kinda guy shoots a dog… This don't feel right.

NEWSPAPER CUTTING
MISSING FARMER FOUND DEAD
Lost Heaven, IL. June 17th. Harry Smith, missing for two months, was confirmed dead today by the Lost Heaven county coroner office.
A fruitless search led by the farmer's father and neighbors ended several weeks ago. The grisly discovery of the body was made by local children looking for edible mushrooms and berries in woodland local to Copse Farm.
The death is not being treated as suspicious, due to how Mr. Smith's body was found:  hanging by the neck. He is survived by his elderly father.

Tommy Angelo: Where the hell are you hiding?

[He walks up to the truck and knocks on the door.]

Tommy Angelo: Hey buddy!

[Tommy opens the door and the driver just falls out of the truck. He's dead.]

Tommy Angelo: Jesus!

[Tommy is surreptitiously approached by two gangsters.]

Gangster 1: Drop your weapon!

Tommy Angelo: You first.

Gangster 1: We don't have time for this.

Gangster 2: Sorry, pal. Guess we're doin' this the hard way.

Tommy Angelo: Okay then.

[He shots Gangster 1 dead.]

Gangster 2: Get over here! I got him pinned down! Hey! HEY! Over here!

[Tommy kills several gangsters.]

Paulie: Whoa! It's me, Tom!

Tommy Angelo: Paulie? What took you so long?

Paulie: Lookin' for Sammy! Did you find him?

Tommy Angelo: Nah, not yet. Just him.

[He points to the corpse lying on the ground.]

Paulie: Canadian crew. Dollars to doughnuts, the rest are face down in the dirt too. 

[Paulie examines the bodies of the recently murdered gangsters. He pulls out of the pocket of one of them... a police badge.]

Paulie: Oh, Christ… They're cops, Tommy.

Tommy Angelo: How would I know? They didn't show a badge! They didn't say anything!

Paulie: They must be in Morello's pocket. This bastard. He can't even let us have this one racket… Forget about it, Tom. We gotta find Sam and get outta here.

Tommy Angelo: These guys are the real deal. They gotta be cops from the border patrol.

Paulie: Looks like we found the Canadians. You see Sam in there?

Tommy Angelo: Nah.

Paulie: (sound of relief) Well that's somethin'.

Paulie: Check every building! Sam could be anywhere!

[In a building nearby, Tommy hears voices and tries not to make any noise...]

Policeman 1: See that hooch they got in the truck? We hit pay dirt.

Policeman 2: They should expected heat. They deserve what they got.

Policeman 1: No-one would be stupid enough to come. Not here.

Policeman 2: I cannot WAIT to be home. Finally.

[Tommy chokes one of them.]

BORDER PATROL ORDERS
George.
I have it on good authority that Salieri's whiskey handover is TONIGHT.
Our mutual friend wants this line of Canadian booze coming into the city shut down. I want you and your men at the farm we discussed by 9PM.
Wait through the night, and tell the boys it's fine if things get rough. They can take some hooch home, to thank them for coming so far south.
Good hunting.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. Border cops doing Morello's dirty work.

Policeman 1: Shoot him!

Policeman 3: Can't even remember the last time I pulled this trigger.

Policeman 1: Over here!

Policeman 3: Makin' a mess outta that guy!

[Tommy kills them.]

Paulie: Ugh! Something up in the barn over there, Tom.

[In the next building, they see a barely alive man crawling on the floor. Using him as a distraction, the police attack Tommy.]

Man: *Suppressed cough*

Policeman: Shhh!

Policeman: Take that guy OUT!

Paulie: That's Sam!

Policeman: Hear that?!

[Tommy and Paulie go outside. They see Sam standing on the second floor of the barn, fighting off the police, but he soon gets shot.]

Paulie: Tom, Sam's been clipped!

Policeman: Over here!

[Tommy, Paulie and a couple of their men have to fight a whole police squad to get to Sam.]

Tommy Angelo: Come on fellas! Push through!

Policeman: One's hurt bad!

Policeman: Right here!

Policeman: Got an angle!

Policeman: Makin' a mess outta that guy!

Paulie: Tommy! Look out! They got a new guy come in!

Policeman: Gah! They hurt me bad.

Policeman: Agh. They got me!

Policeman: They're takin' me apart!

Policeman:Move up their side!

Policeman: They cut him down!

[Finally all the policemen are killed.]

Tommy Angelo: Thank Christ. We gotta get to him!

Paulie: (to the crew) You boys stay here and watch our backs. Plug anyone who gets within a hundred yards. 'Cept us.

Tommy Angelo: Hey, Paulie.

[They find Sam. He’s lying on the floor, groaning.]

Paulie: Sammy! Ah Jesus, what've they done to you?

Sam: I got clipped. Christ, that's a lot of blood...

Paulie: Can you walk?

Sam: No. No, I don't think so.

Paulie: Okay. Okay, okay, okay… just hang on. I'll go get the truck. Then we'll take you to the doctor. Hey, hey, you're gonna make it, Sam. Tommy, stay here with him. I'll be back, I'll be back in a flash. (runs away)

Tommy Angelo: Okay.

[He tries to move Sam and help him sit.]

Sam: Ahhh, ahhh, fuck!

Tommy Angelo: Hey, it'll be okay, Sam. We've survived worse.

Sam: Sure... Sure we have… 

[Unexpectedly, someone kills the guys at the entrance to the barn. Tommy has to protect Sam.]

Sam: Where'd all these guys come from?

Policeman: Over here!

Sam: Thank Christ you came when you did.

Policeman: Got you!

Policeman: See 'im!

Sam: C'mon Tom - finish 'em! I'm checking out over here!

Policeman: Got some heat here!

Sam: (throws a molotov) Catch!

Policeman: CLEAR OUT!

Policeman: They're on my back!

Sam: Go fetch! Help me out Tom... I'm hurtin' over here… Jesus, this hurts… Jesus Christ! Where's the goddamn truck!? Crap. We got cops.

Policeman: Kill him!

Policeman: Over here!

Sam: Have that ya bastards! Hold them off just a little longer! I'm a sitting duck here!

Policeman: They're on me!

Policeman: Say goodnight, punk.

Policeman: They're on ta me!

Sam: They're comin' up the stairs! Sons of bitches! Take 'em down or I'm a dead man! Don't let 'em near!

Policeman: You're a dead man walking!

[By the time Paulie pulls up in the truck to the barn, Tommy has already disposed of all the cops.]

Paulie: Oh, Christ! Tony and Donnie too?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah.

Paulie: What a fuckin' massacre. How's Sam?

Tommy Angelo: Well he ain't any worse.

Paulie: I'll go get him. Keep an eye out.

[Tommy keeps an eye on his surroundings. Paulie brings out Sam coughing up blood.]

Paulie: C'mon, pal, we're goin' home.

Sam: I need the doctor, Paulie...

Paulie: Yeah, I can see that, Sammy. Just hang on.

Tommy Angelo: I gotcha, I gotcha... Okay...

Paulie: Okay, okay... Okay. We're gonna get you all patched up.

Sam: Okay.

Tommy Angelo: Paulie, we got more company!

Paulie: Alright, get in!

Tommy Angelo: I'm right here, Sam.

[Tommy stays in the back with Sam. Paulie gets behind the wheel. He gets very nervous.]

Paulie: There's some ammo and a Thompson back there somewhere. When they pull in behind you, blast 'em to hell. Just don't let 'em get past us!

Tommy Angelo: That thing back there is huge! Where the hell did they find that truck?

Policeman: Get over here NOW!

Sam: Take 'em out, Tom!

Paulie: Let 'em have it!

Tommy Angelo: Good night asshole!

Paulie: You think we're okay now?

Sam: Do you?!

Policeman: We need you OUT of here!

Sam: Yeh, he's gone!

Tommy Angelo: These guys keep on coming! Paulie! The truck's comin' for us!

Sam: They're too close Tom!

Tommy Angelo: Paulie! Faster!

Paulie: My pedal is to the metal!

Sam: Aghhhh!

Paulie: Did we lose 'em?!

Tommy Angelo: Two squad cars on us!

Paulie: Ah! Shit!

Tommy Angelo: These guys keep on coming!

Sam: You like that, you bastards? We're in trouble Tom! We're not gonna take much more!

Tommy Angelo: Okay, one down! They're right on our ass!

Paulie: They're getting close!

Sam: Shoot them! Not the road! Them!

Paulie: Rrraahhhh!

[He rams a policeman on a motorcycle.]

Paulie: Haha!

Tommy Angelo: Ahh!

Sam: Ah! Fu—

Paulie: Shit!

[The truck almost falls into a hole and hangs on the edge of the cliff.]

Tommy Angelo: Sam! You ok?

Sam: We're in trouble Tom!

[Tommy shoots at the police officers who drive up.]

Policeman: Over here!

Policeman: Got ya!

Paulie: This thing's fallin' apart!

Tommy Angelo: Paulie, we need to go now!

Sam: That thing's gonna...

Tommy Angelo: Paulie! We got…

[The police car pushes the truck and our bandits fall into the abyss...]

Tommy Angelo: Ugh!

Sam: Agh!

Paulie: Ah!

Tommy Angelo: Ugh!

Sam: Agh!

[...and lands on the road below.]

Paulie: (rejoicing) I'm a wheelman too Tom!

[Suddenly they are attacked by AN ARMORED CAR with A MACHINE GUN on the roof!]

Tommy Angelo: Shit!

Sam: Shoot out their gun when there's a break in the fire! They're reloading! Shoot! Now!

Paulie: Shoot now! While we got the chance!

Sam: Get the turret while they reload! Take out the windshield armor, Tom!I got an idea! The windshield! Shoot out the windshield! Tommy! Hit the windshield!

Paulie: For Chrissakes, Tom! Go for the windshield!

[Breaking through the windshield, Tommy throws a molotov cocktail in it.]

Paulie: Set him alight, Tom!

Tommy Angelo: Paulie! We gotta lose 'em!

Paulie: Ahhh! We did it, we did it!

[They get to the doctor quickly.]

Paulie: Okay, we're here! Tom. you get Sam out. I'm gonna go wake up the doc.

Tommy Angelo: Sam. Sam! We made it. We're at the doctor's house.

Sam: That's three I owe ya.

Doctor: Paulie? What the hell are you doing here so late?

Paulie: Hey, ah... Evenin', doc. I'm sorry to wake you, but um... We had a little accident. We got an injured man out here.

Doctor: Alright. Bring him inside.

Paulie: Okay, thank you. Okay, I'll stay with Sam. You can take the truck back,call it a night.

Tommy Angelo: No. I'll wait.

Paulie: The doc's already got his hands full. No sense in both of us breathing down his neck.

Sam: Go'on Tom. I'm gonna be fine.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, okay.

Paulie: Hey. You did good tonight.

[He closes the door. Tommy brings the truck to the docks and drives to Sarah’s apartment.]

Sarah: You're late. Dinner's cold.

Tommy Angelo: Work.

[Sarah understandably and without words removes Tommy's soggy trench coat. Hanging the coat on the rack, Sarah notices it's covered in blood. Sarah walks over to Tommy and hugs him.]

Tommy Angelo: Marry me.

Sarah: Okay.

Chapter 10: Omerta (1933)
[Tommy meets Don Salieri in the park. The Don is feeding pigeons sitting on a bench.]

Tommy Angelo: Hey boss. I came as soon as I got your message.

Don Salieri: Sit down, Tom. We have a mole, Tom.

Tommy Angelo: No. Who?

Don Salieri: I was up all night, driving myself nuts trying to figure it out. I started thinking, maybe it's one of our guys we aren't paying his fair share. Someone with a light wallet, maybe looking to Morello for a new suit. Frank wasn't around, so I went to the safe to get the account books, to see who's getting cents on the dollar he's earned.

Tommy Angelo: What d'you know?

Don Salieri: The books are gone, Tom.

Tommy Angelo: Frank.

Don Salieri: More than fifty years I've known him. Everything I have, I got with Frank. And every buck we've earned, every dime we’ve paid out, it's all logged in those books. Frank hands those over to the Feds, we're finished.

Tommy Angelo: Frank respects one person in this whole town, and that's you. This has gotta be some kind of misunderstanding.

Don Salieri: I been calling him all day. I went by his place. Hors gone. His wife and kid are gone.

Tommy Angelo: But why?

Don Salieri:I don't know. I'm sure he has his reasons. Maybe he's still smarting over the dog…

Tommy Angelo: The one you tried to drown.

Don Salieri: Yeah. Same one I shot, after he wouldn't let me sink her. I was a stupid kid, Tommy. But grudge or no grudge. we gotta get those books back. Shake down all our stoolies. See who knows what. When you catch up to Frank, you get those books. And if he doesn't have 'em on him, you make him tell you where to find them. After that... You do what we gotta do. Vincenzo's waiting for you with a clean car. Morello's wrapped up in all this - I just know it.

[Tommy approaches Vincenzo, standing nearby in the parking lot.]

Vincenzo: We gotta keep a lid on this Tom. Start with Bill, but don't give him nothing. I got you a clean set of wheels. And something special here, if you want it…

[He hands Tommy a sawed-off shotgun.]

Vincenzo: When Frank sees a Lupara, he'll know. The old ways work. I didn't see this coming. Not from Frank.

[Tommy drives to Biff’s Pawn Shop.]

Biff: Tommy! What's the rumpus?

Tommy Angelo: Heard any big news lately? Something the Don might want to know?

Biff: Depends. What's it worth to you?

Tommy Angelo: Twenty bucks.

Biff: How about forty?

Tommy Angelo: Alright spill.

Biff: The FBI's in town. They're getting something from Morello - but I don't know what.

Tommy Angelo: How'd you hear?

Biff: Little Tony got some guy drunk in the Black Cat and drove him home. Heard a bunch of stuff. So he's the guy you wanna see.

Tommy Angelo: Okay. Thanks.

Biff: Always a pleasure Tommy.

[Tommy drives to meet Little Tony.]

GO GET 'EM BOYS!
GAME SEVEN OF THE 1933 GOLD SERIES TAKES PLACE TODAY!
The Lost Heaven Lancers play the Empire Bay Cannons at the Armory, with one team certain to take home the trophy. After a heroic campaign filled with exhilarating twists, captain Bunny Smyth will lead his men onto the diamond to play for the Lancers first Series victory in over two decades.

Little Tony: Everything okay Tom?

Tommy Angelo: No, no it's not. What's this about the guy you drove home who's with the feds?

Little Tony: He came in for a drink, which turned into ten. He's hired muscle for some kinda safehouse.

Tommy Angelo: Where?

Little Tony: Oakhill. Corner of Pine. He gave me ten bucks to drive him back and keep my mouth shut. Let on that Councillor Ghillotti's brokered some kinda deal between Morello and the FBI. They were all ready to sit tight on someone in there.

Tommy Angelo: Why the hell didn't you tell us?!

Little Tony: Tom. I did. I came in to see Frank straightaway. He didn't tell the Don?

Tommy Angelo: No. No he didn't.

Little Tony: Tom. What's going on?

[Tommy gets in the car and drives to the secret hideout. There he sees Frank getting into the car, surrounded by armed guards. Tommy follows the car.]

Tommy Angelo: (to himself) Looks like the place… Take me to those account books, Frank… Where are they moving you to? Gotta be some kinda meet happening… Ah, shit they taking you to the airport Frank? Christ. They're flying him outta state or something. Fuck. This ain't good. 

[Tommy pulls over near the airport.]

Man: Who are these people? The FBI?

Woman: Guy just flashed a badge at me and forced me out…

[Tommy sneaks into the airport.]

Man 1: Guess we all want the same thing but can't say I'm happy dealing with these... people...

Man 2: The plane they're gonna use is Don Morello's. I'm sure of it.

POLICE NOTES
Informant Handover
1200-We shut down airport
1300-Informant and FBI escort leave safehouse
1315-Informant exchanged and taken to HANGAR 5
We get accounts book AFTER informant handed over

Man 3: I heard there's some guy the feds are handing over, before he's flown out. In a civilian plane.

Frank: Morello hasn't the honor to even show his face?

FBI: For a rat like you? Nah. Get in the car.

FBI 2: This is the way that families go down - not with guns blazing. Stoolies and tax records.

FBI 3: It's the way they got Capone.

FBI 2: And now it's how Ennio Salieri dies in jail. It's a good day my friend. The FBI hand over Colletti, Morello makes him disappear in his plane. Then those accounts books bring Salieri to his knees.

[Tommy catches up with Frank in Hangar 5. He pulls out Vincenzo’s shotgun.]

Frank: Tom.

Tommy Angelo: Frank. The Don sent me.

Frank: I figured as much. I'm sorry it had to be you, Tommy.

Tommy Angelo: Anything you want me to tell him?

Frank: I wish it could have shaken out better, but Morello finally came after me. It's okay. You can come out.

[Frank’s wife and daughter come up to him.]

Frank: Morello offered me a simple trade. The Don's account books for our lives. And tickets out of this town.

Tommy Angelo: You hand the books over yet?

Frank: I'm not so stupid, Tom. They're safe, Morello was waiting for this. It's a key to a box in the Grand Imperial Bank downtown. I told Morello I'd hand it over after the plane was fueled and ready to go. His men were meant to fetch it before we left.

Tommy Angelo: I took care of them. Tell them to get on the plane.

Frank: Go on March, Alice. Get aboard.

March: Frank, you're coming with us.

Frank: Not right now, honey. Just get buckled in. Tommy and I, we have some serious business to discuss.

March: But Frank...

Frank: Get on the plane, March. For Alice. For me. Get on the god damn plane, please.

Tommy Angelo: You been paid yet?

Pilot: Yeah.

[He throws the pilot a wad of cash.]

Tommy Angelo: Now you've been paid twice. You take the ladies wherever they wanna go.

Pilot: Yes sir. (leaves)

Frank: Thank you Tom.

Tommy Angelo: Christ. Frank... Why didn't you ask us for help?

Frank: I guess I just wanted out, one way or the other. I'm tired Tommy. Tired of lying to my wife. Tired of checking under my car every time I take a Sunday drive. And tired of waiting for the Don to put two in my temple.

[Frank's wife, getting ready for the shot, covers her daughter's face with her hands. The pilot hastily starts the plane.]

Tommy Angelo: God damn you Frank…

[He puts the shogun down, and then nods at him to get on the plane. Frank hugs his family. The plane leaves. Tommy goes to the bank to pick up the books.]

Bank Employee: Good afternoon sir.

Tommy Angelo: Where's the safety deposit boxes?

Bank Employee: With my colleague downstairs, sir.

Tommy Angelo: Thanks.

[He goes downstairs.]

Guard: Beautiful day, huh?

Tommy Angelo: Uh-huh.

[He finds another bank employee.]

Tommy Angelo: I need to access the deposit boxes - for Frank Colletti.

Bank Employee 2: Ah yes, Mister... Angelo?

Tommy Angelo: Uh, yeah.

Bank Employee 2: Mister Colletti said it might be you who came, and to provide access. Please, follow me.

Tommy Angelo: (offscreen) I got the books and covered my tracks. Salieri never asked any questions. In fact, apart from the funeral, I never heard him talk about Frank again.

[He burns down Frank's house and goes to his funeral. Some time later, Don Morello's car arrives.]

Don Salieri: You're making my boys twitchy, Marcu.

Don Morello: Sergio and I just came by to pay our respects. That's all. Known Frank a long time, almost as long as you. He was a good man. Smart. Loyal.

Don Morello: Loyal to his wife, his kid, above all else. There must be some kind of honor in that, Ennio.

Don Salieri: Maybe. But I'm still looking at this headstone, with his little girl's name on it.

Don Morello: It's a hell of a thing…

Chapter 11: Visiting Rich People (1933)
[Tommy rides in a car with Don Salieri through the wealthy neighborhood of Lost Heaven with Carlo behind the wheel. It's nighttime outside.]

Don Salieri: Look at those houses... Big yards, white picket fences. It's the American dream, eh Tommy?

Tommy Angelo: I suppose.

Don Salieri: Not for you?

Tommy Angelo: No, sir. I like being closer to the business.

Don Salieri: Don't let the flower beds and front porches fool you. There's more criminals out here than in the rest of the city combined.

Tommy Angelo: That why we're in the neighborhood?

Don Salieri: In a way. Morello's got a dirty prosecutor on his payroll, name of Watkins. Turns out, he's old friends with Ghillotti.

Tommy Angelo: The city counselor?

Don Salieri: The same. Morello let drop that we might've had something to do with the Ghillotti boy's death. Now Watkins is loaded for bear, trying to do right by his buddy. Word is, he's striking gold with a few witnesses.

Tommy Angelo: You have names?

Don Salieri: Yeah, but Paulie and Sam are taking care of them. I'm putting you on a different part of the job. We need whatever Watkins has got on us.

Tommy Angelo: Where's he holding? I'm no safe cracker.

Don Salieri: Don't worry about that. We're taking you to meet Salvatore. He's fresh off the boat, but he knows how to pop open anything. Just get him into the villa, find the safe, and he'll do the rest.

Tommy Angelo: What kind of rumpus should I expect?

Don Salieri: Nothing you can't handle. Watkins is going to the theater, so the house should be empty except for a bit of muscle. The office is on the first floor, and our stoolie says the safe is in the wall. Once Salvatore has the safe, open, grab all the evidence and get out.

Carlo: That him, boss?

Don Salieri: Yeah, that's our guy. Salvatore! Tutto bene? (How are you?)

Salvatore: Si, grazie, Don Salieri. (Good. Thank you, Don Salieri.) (kisses Don’s hand)

Don Salieri: Good to see ya. You know the job. Don't let me down.

Salvatore: Se. Lu capisciu. (Yes. I understand.)

Don Salieri: Tommy. If you bump into Watkins, don't kill him. It'll just bring down more heat.

Tommy Angelo: You got it boss.

Don Salieri: Buona fortuna ragazzi! (Good luck boys!)

Tommy Angelo: Tommy. Tommy Angelo. Piacere di... di conoscerti… (Nice to... to meet you…)

Salvatore: Meraviglioso. Per favore. (Wonderful. Please.)

[He hands Tommy the car keys. They get in the car and drive to the mission.]

Salvatore: Parli almeno un po' di italiano? Il capo ti ha detto il piano? (Do you speak even a little Italian? Did the boss tell you the plan?)

Tommy Angelo: Ah, I don't speak Italian.

Salvatore: Eccellente. Fantastico... (Excellent. Great…) Know... plan...?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. The boss told me.

Salvatore: Err... please... understand… Entriamo dal labirinto senza farci sentire ne vedere. La cassaforte e dietro un dipinto al primo piano. Dammi un po' di tempo e lascia fare tutto a me. Quella cassaforte avrà sicuramente un allarme. (We enter from the maze without being heard or seen. The safe is behind a painting on the second floor. Give me some time and let me do everything myself. That safe will definitely have an alarm.)

Tommy Angelo: Uh. Yeah, this is going to be a long night for the both of us...

Salvatore: Cristo santo… (Jesus Christ…)

Tommy Angelo: Okay my turn: Do what I do. Do not get caught.

Salvatore: Si. (Yes.)

Tommy Angelo: You gotta keep safe.

Salvatore: Safe! Si! Is... my job! Apro cassaforte! (I open safe!) Open 'safe'!

Tommy Angelo: Christ. Okay: radio. Let's listen to the radio.

Salvatore: Eccellente. (Excellent.)

Tommy Angelo: Hell of a view up here.

Salvatore: A volte questo paese è stupendo. (Sometimes this country is beautiful.) Ecco. Entramo da li. (Here. We'll go in through there.) Errr… over... wall......Labirinto (maze).

Tommy Angelo: What?

Salvatore: Vedrai. (You'll see.)

Tommy Angelo: Ohhh, a maze...

Salvatore: Si, un labirinto. (Yes, a maze.)

[Tommy climbs over the fence.]

Tommy Angelo: Stay here while I take out the guards.

Salvatore: A quanto pare, in America hanno i labirinti… (Apparently, in America they have mazes...)

[Tommy moves quietly through the maze, knocking out the guards.]

Guard: *whistles*

Guard: Sure wish I could have a night off...

Guard: Nice evening for standin' around I guess.

Tommy Angelo: Think that's all of 'em… Salvatore! Where are you? We're clear!

Salvatore: Tommy! I here!

Tommy Angelo: Where'd the hell he go?

Salvatore: Sono qui (I'm here), Tommy!

Tommy Angelo: Guy's a pain in the ass.

Salvatore: Forza! Vieni con me! (Come on! Come with me!)

[Tommy finally finds Salvatore. He sees the bodies of the guards in the maze.]

Salvatore: Oof… Sei un tipo tosto, eh? (You're a tough guy, huh?)

Tommy Angelo: What?

Salvatore: C'è un'entrata. (There is the entrance.) Open! Kick!

Tommy Angelo: What kinda lockpicker are you?

Salvatore: Look for......dipinto (painting).

Tommy Angelo: A what?

Salvatore: Err... Da Vinci. Caravaggio...

Tommy Angelo: Painting? You're saying it's behind a painting?

Salvatore: Si, si! (Yes, yes!)

Tommy Angelo: Okay. I understand.

Salvatore: Non quello. (Not here.)

Tommy Angelo: Guess we got another room to check…

Salvatore: Qui c'è un altro dipinto. (Here is another painting.)

NEWSPAPER-JULY 1ST 1933
EMPIRE BAY MOB BOSS MURDERED
SPECTACULAR PICTURES OF VILE KINGPIN'S FIERY END! Notorious racketeer Tomaso Moretti was killed outside his Empire Bay residence last Thursday afternoon, the sole victim of a car bomb undoubtedly planted by an underworld rival. Bay residents will hope that Moretti's death brings to an end the spate of gang violence that has rocked their city in recent months. Few will mourn his passing.

Tommy Angelo: Only wall behind here.

Salvatore: Sembra di valore. (Looks valuable.) Al Procuratore piace la roba costosa. (The DA likes expensive stuff.) Here. Tommy.

Tommy Angelo: Nothin' again.

[While searching the house, they accidentally encounter a maid washing the windows.]

Maid: Who are you? Ma'am! Ma'am! Someone help us!

Tommy Angelo: We're not here to hurt you. Just get out of the house.

Tommy Angelo: There's one.

Salvatore: Non quello. (Not here.) 

[Finally Tommy finds the safe.]

Salvatore: Ah, bravo! (Ah, well done!) 

[Tommy wants to take care of the safe, but Salvatore reminds him of himself.]

Salvatore: Uh uh, scusa. (Uh uh, excuse me.)

Tommy Angelo: Sure. Show me what you can do.

Tommy Angelo: Shit! Be quick, Salvatore!

Salvatore: Shhh! Pacenza, pacenza… (Patience, patience…)

[He skillfully picks the combination for the safe.]

Tommy Angelo: Nice work. Scusami.

[Pushing Salvatore away, Tommy tears into the contents of the safe. The alarm goes on.]

Salvatore: Accura! (Careful!) Era collegato all'allarme! (It was connected to the alarm!)

Tommy Angelo: What?

Salvatore: Intrappolato! (It was a trap!)

Tommy Angelo: It doesn't matter... Come on, we need to get out of here. Vai dietro, dietro! (Go to the back, back!)

Guard: They gotta be upstairs! The safe's in his study!

[Tommy starts killing.]

Guard: Over here!

Guard: Ya in my sights!

Guard: We're down a guy!

Guard: They cut him down!

Guard: They're trying to pick me off!

Tommy Angelo: Salvatore… stay back! I'll deal with 'em!

Dispatch: (via radio) All available officers please respond to reports of gunshots. This guy's dangerous. You have permission to shoot.

Tommy Angelo: Take the car?

Tommy Angelo: Finally, I get you first time.

Salvatore: Forza! Andiamocene! (Come on! Let's go!) Presto! Semina gli sbirri. (Quick! Lose the cops.)

Tommy Angelo: I know! Whatever you're saying: I know!

[He steals a car.]

Dispatch: (via radio) All cars, pursuit is called off, abandon search and return to patrols.

Salvatore: Grazie a Dio. (Thank God.)

Tommy Angelo: Salvatore, where do I take you now?

Salvatore: ...home?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. Where home?

Salvatore: Err... Sixth and... Maple?

Tommy Angelo: Okay, let's go.

Salvatore: Tommy, devo dirti una cosa (I need to tell you something). Al nostro prossimo lavoro, penso io alla cassaforte, hai capito? (On our next job, I'll take care of the safe, you understand?) Ci ho quasi rimesso la pelle in quella villa, ed è tutta colpa tua. (I almost lost my life in that mansion, and it's all your fault.) E impara almeno un po' di italiano, per rispetto della nostra patria! (And learn at least a little Italian, out of respect for our country!) E come parlare al mio cane, lo so, ma Cristo, dovevo dirlo. (And it’s like talking to my dog, I know, but Christ, I had to say it.) Non farlo mai più. Mai più. (Don't ever do that again. Never again.)

Tommy Angelo: Okay. Okay... sure.

[He drives Salvatore home.]

Salvatore: Good night.

Tommy Angelo: Night.

Chapter 12: Great Deal (1933)
[Morning. Salieri’s restaurant. Several gangsters are loading crates of alcohol into a truck.]

Sam: This is the last of the good stuff, boss.

Don Salieri: I know. Some of those bottles I've had for ten years. But, we gotta make payroll. Get it outta here.

Sam: You heard him. Load it up.

Don Salieri: Good to see you, boys.

Tommy Angelo: Boss. Any word on the job I pulled with Salvatore?

Don Salieri: You did fine, Tom. Ghillotti's got nothing on us now. We bought some time. At least until the money runs out.

Paulie: Don't go selling off the farm yet, boss.

Don Salieri: Sam says you’ve worked out an angle?

Paulie: Yeah, and you're gonna love it, boss. We make a few bucks and knock out a couple a' Morello's teeth too.

Don Salieri: Okay. What's the rumpus?

Paulie: Couple a' weeks ago, or relaxin in the cigar lounge at the Blue Tropics.

Don Salieri: Where?

Sam: Some small time whorehouse. Just a couple a' closets with some mattresses on the floor.

Paulie: It's a gentlemen's club. They got a bar and everythin'. Anyways, one of the johns is soused, he's cryin' to the madame about his all troubles. He catches my ear on account a' his goofy accent. He's goin' on and on about how he just landed this huge payday, but the goons he's workin' for are already twistin' his arm, and he's got the busted nose to show for it.

Tommy Angelo: You pick up his tab?

Paulie: Hell no. But, I walked him outta the place, took him to the diner 'round the corner to sober up. We get talkin', and it turns out his name is Gates, he's this hick up from Kentucky.

Don Salieri: Moonshiner?

Paulie: Uh, uh uh. Better. His pop's got a couple a real distilleries. And I give you one guess as to their exclusive buyer 'round these parts.

Sam: Morello.

Don Salieri: And you think he wants to burn bridges?

Paulie: Oh yeah. I been workin' him steady, Boss. He's bringing up another shipment tonight, but he's got his entire crew ready to roll over. All we gotta do is make it look like a proper heist.

Sam: I don't know, Paulie. You really trust this guy?

Paulie: He's got no love for Morello, I'll tell you that. Not like we got a lot of options here. We'll be cuttin' up the last bean pretty soon boss.

Don Salieri: What do you think, Tom?

Tommy Angelo: We need to replace the Canadian, If Paulie says this Gates can do that, I'm in.

Don Salieri: Where's the meet?

Paulie: The big parking garage downtown.

Don Salieri: Okay, do it. But you'd better not be playing grab-ass this time. You take Carlo and Little Bill with you.

Paulie: Sure thing, boss.

Don Salieri: Once you have the truck drive it back here.

Paulie: We won't let you down boss.

Don Salieri: Don't make me regret giving you some time out there in the streets with the guys, Carlo.

Carlo: You don't have to worry about me.

Don Salieri: I know I don't - Tommy does that for me.

Tommy Angelo: I'll keep your driver safe, boss.

Don Salieri: Buona fortuna (good luck) boys.

Paulie: Sam and Little Bill said to meet them downtown.

[Tommy, Carlo and Paulie get in the car and drive out.]

Paulie: You okay Carlo? Looking kinda like you shit yourself...

Carlo: Ah, get bent.

Paulie: Big moment, huh? Finally running with the pack.

Carlo: Listen. I spend more time with the Don that all of you put together.

Paulie: Sure, sure. Sat out on the road waiting till he's finished with his broad.

Carlo: If you don't want me to come - I won't. It's fine. Boss doesn't have to know.

Paulie: Nah, you're coming. The boss said you're coming. Just you've gotta face like you're being taking for an airing. I don't want Gates thinking we're frails.

Tommy Angelo: Why's Gates sour on Morello anyways?

Paulie: First time Gates pulled in with his trucks, Morello decided to change up the terms. The big quy himself popped him in the nose, as part of the "renegotiation."

Tommy Angelo: His nose is gonna get more than a pop if Morello hears we're involved.

Paulie: That's why we're pretending to stick him up. Then he'll go back to his pop and tell a sob story about being robbed at gunpoint. He'll convince his old man that Morello can't protect the merchandise. They'll need to find a new buyer out here, and he's heard of a stand-up guy - name of Salieri.

Carlo: This plan is some bullshit. Tom. Paulie told it to me yesterday, and somehow it's gotten worse.

Paulie: Hey, when you get a lead for the boss and you don't just drive him places? Then! Then you get to pick holes. Till then, shut your damn mouth.

Carlo: Eh, whatever helps you sleep. When Morello tracks you down, don't come crying to me.

Paulie: You serious? You actually serious?!

Tommy Angelo: Fellas! Knock it off! Christ…

[They arrive at the Parking Lot.]

Paulie: I do a lot of deals here parking attendant don't ask for much dough. Always closes up shop till I'm done.

Sam: Okay - we're good! Gates is waiting up on the top floor.

Paulie: C'mon, let's go.

[Tommy pulls into a multi-level parking lot and looks for a place to park.]

Tommy Angelo: Place seems clear so far.

Paulie: Only people with cars are people with jobs. Nine to five place is deserted.

Tommy Angelo: Well, we got jobs and we're here.

Paulie: A kind of a job, sure.

Tommy Angelo: Anything else we need to know about Gates, Paulie?

Paulie: Only that he's got a bust-up nose, and crates full of the good stuff.

Tommy Angelo: Our kinda guy.

Paulie: Our kinda guy. Park up over there.

Gates: Paulie! Good to see you, Pal.

Paulie: Yeah, you too Gates.

Gates: Well, I hope you all have good taste in whiskey.

Paulie: I ain't really the expert here. Tommy?

Tommy Angelo: (sips from a bottle) Yeah. It's fine. Your first payment. If the Don's impressed, he'll finance more runs.

Paulie: An' each one gonna be bigger than the last. We're all gonna be rich, boys.

Gates: Well, we're always happy to do business with good folks like Don Salieri. Please, give him my regards.

Paulie: Sure thing. Now we just gotta conclude this transaction.

[Gates hands Paulie the keys. In response, Paulie punches Gates in the face.]

Tommy Angelo: Damnit Paulie!

Gates: No! No! It's okay.

Paulie: What? I told you we had to make it look like a proper robbery.

Gates: Damn thing is going to be crooked by the time I'm done with this city.

Paulie: Ah, don't worry pal. With all the dough you're raking in, you're gonna be able to pay for a new one.

[Suddenly, Morello's gangsters arrive. Without a word, they open fire with their tommyguns and a shotgun. Most of Gate’s men are killed. Gates himself also takes one.]

Tommy Angelo: Watch out!

Paulie: Ah shit, Goddammit!

Sam: Pull it together, Paulie!

Gates: Ah!

Paulie: Goddammit!

Gangster: Hey! HEY! Over here!

Gangster: They're trying to pick me off!

Sam: Get away from 'em! Rubbed 'em out.

Paulie: How the hell they know about this!?

Carlo: Because you always shoot your mouth off!

Sam: Gates took a bullet!

Gates: This ain't as bad as it looks, take the booze and get! My guys'll come for me! Go! Go! So long as you guys clear them out up ahead, I'll be safe here with the little guy!

Sam: Carlo, in the cab with me. You're no use dead. Tommy, check for more of them, this thing ain't over!

Paulie: C'mon, I'll back you up.

Tommy Angelo: We got more of 'em!

Paulie: Gotta reload!

Paulie: More of these guys? You like that? They got back-up! There's more! We're doin' great! Keep at 'em! Ah crap, I'm bleedin'.

Sam: Get away from 'em!

Gangster: They are on my back!

Sam: Truck's moving!

Gangster: There!

Gangster: Over here!

Gangster: Son of a...

Gangster: Got ya.

Paulie: Fuck! Me! The truck can't get through this - we gotta put it out! Look for extinguishers or something! I see fire sprinklers up on the ceiling! We need to turn 'em on! There's gotta be a valve to turn someplace! There a way through this fence?

Gangster: Say goodnight, punk.

Paulie: That... was intense. Can still feel flames on my face. Christ.

Sam: Stay close and keep moving, fellas. Keep the booze safe. I'll move the truck with you. You see more, you shoot 'em.

Paulie: Knew this wasn't over...

Gangster: Seen him!

Sam: They got another friend Tom! Go fetch!

Gangster: Yaaargh!

Paulie: Sam! We're clear! Get the truck outta here!

Sam: Okay we're getting outta here!

Carlo: Can't believe I lived through that...

Paulie: Follow 'em close. If I know Morello, he'll have guys on the streets. Lots of guys.

Sam: Grab a set of wheels and watch my back.

Tommy Angelo: Sure, Sam.

[They leave the fiery deathtrap parking lot.]

Paulie: How the hell did Morello hear about my deal?

Tommy Angelo: All kinds of beefers in this city. For now let's get the booze back to the warehouse, and try not to die.

Paulie: I knew it - we got more guys on us.

Tommy Angelo: Okay. Let's slow them down some.

Paulie: Hit 'em where it hurts.

Gangster: There!

Paulie: Morello's sent more guys after us!

Tommy Angelo: Another motor coming after the booze truck...

Gangster: Got ya!

Paulie: Sam's going through the Hooverville!

Tommy Angelo: So I guess we are too.

Paulie: They don't stop coming, do they? I think we lost 'em all.

Tommy Angelo: Thank Christ for that. Let's head home. See what we got.

Paulie: We got the booze. I mean, I know it didn't go to plan but...we got the booze.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. Though tonight - me and you are gonna drink a bunch of it.

Paulie: I guess we earned that much.

[By skirmishing with Morello's men, they manage to get the liquor truck safely to Salieri's restaurant.]

Don Salieri: (notices a bullet hiole) Looks like a thirty-eight. Morello's boys caught up with you?

Sam: Yeah, boss. We took care of it.

Don Salieri: What about the kid from Kentucky?

Tommy Angelo: Well, he took slug to the shoulder. But, he's a tough blocker. He and his crew dusted out as soon as we bumped off Morello's hatchet men.

Paulie: Gettin' shot will give Gates and his pop another reason to ice Morello outta the whiskey business.

Don Salieri: Well, let's see if this hooch was worth all the trouble. (sips) Excellent. I'll work out the details with papa Gates. But once we're running this Kentucky brown, we'll be back in brass buttons. Good work, son. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of all of you. Salute!

Tommy Angelo: Salute!

Paulie: Salute!

[They drink.]

Intermezzo (Interlude) (1938)
Detective Norman: Sounds like Salieri was gettin' ready to make his move?

Tommy Angelo: Workin' up to it, maybe. But then, Prohibition ended and the bootleggin' business got knocked on its ass. All that fightin' over booze meant next to nothin'... Took us a few years to recover. But when we did bounce back, boy, it was somethin'... We took what dough we had from the moonshine and Canadian whiskey, and invested it into new rackets. Some of ‘em even legal. Construction, restaurants, truckin', gambling. We branched out into everythin', except peddlin dope. By '35, things were lookin' up. We had good money rollin' in on the regular. I had a wife and daughter. Sam was runnin' a club for the Don. Even Paulie had a few rackets of his own. He wasn't exactly happy, but, whaddya call it…

Detective Norman: Content.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, that was it. And Salieri, he finally starts talkin' about getting outta Morello's shadow. Maybe buyin' our own cops, our own politicians.

Detective Norman: Huh. That's interestin'... You think Salieri was sourcin' highbinders in '34?

Tommy Angelo: Maybe... Why?

Detective Norman: Well, a few years back, the vice squad got a judge on solicitation of a minor. Once in the box, he started confessing to all sorts of misbehavin', tryin' to get a deal. But he copped to takin' kickbacks from Morello and your man Salieri. Playin’ 'em off one another tryin' to goose the take, but, once Morello found out, he threatened to bury the judge's kids on the beach, still breathin' of course...

Tommy Angelo: Christ... That was the missin' piece...

Detective Norman: How's that?

Tommy Angelo: Morello was always windin' us up, but he never did anything that might start an all-out war. Learnin' Salieri was building his own bench must've finally tipped his scales. Because in '35, he hit us with both barrels…

Chapter 13: Bon Appétit (1935)
[Tommy tells Luigi a funny story.]

Tommy Angelo: ...go of his face, pasted it on his face.

[Salieri enters.]

Don Salieri: Hey, Tommy.

Luigi: Oh...

Tommy Angelo: Oh hey, Boss, what's going on?

Don Salieri: I'm glad you're here.

Luigi: Here ya go, Boss.

Don Salieri: I'm going to Pepé's for lunch, but Carlo called in sick. You up for a drive?

Tommy Angelo: Sure, Boss.

Don Salieri: Bravo. I'm already starving. You got a piece on you?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. You think I'll need it?

Don Salieri: Eh, you know how it is. Things with Morello been a little quiet lately. Maybe it's just got me jumpy is all.

[They get into Salieri's car, a luxurious dark green 1935 Auburn 851 Speedster (which started at $43,639 in today's money). Tommy gets behind the wheel and drives his boss to Pepé's restaurant.]

Don Salieri: So how's business Tom?

Tommy Angelo: You know how it is. It's good.

Don Salieri: Sure I know the business, I see the books every day. But since… what happened... happened. I know that a capo needs to talk to his soldiers without some other guy getting in the way.

Tommy Angelo: I guess we're mixing with a better sort of person now. And I like dealing with all these big shots we got on the pad. Anything better than those grifters trying to shift their hooch before the 21st went through.

Don Salieri: Ah this is only the start of it Tom. I got plans. Plenty of good people, lining up for a slice.

Tommy Angelo: Glad to hear it.

Don Salieri: Must be nice for you. Some time away from Paulie and his cockamamie schemes.

Tommy Angelo: It's better conversation boss, I'll give you that.

Don Salieri: (laughs) Sure I am.

Tommy Angelo: Me, Sam and Paulie though? We're still real tight. We've been through some times together.

Don Salieri: Yeah. Don't I know it. I've been looking forward to this all week. Wait'll you taste the cassata, Tommy.

{Cassata is a traditional Sicilian sweet dessert consisting of a biscuit soaked in fruit juice or liqueur and layers of ricotta, candied fruits, and chocolate or vanilla filling.}

[Tommy stops at the restaurant. Pepé, meanwhile, has his hands full. He has quite a crowd in his restaurant.]

Pepé: Oh, more wine? Ey! More wine here, please! Quickly! (to the client) You're going to love this wine, it's a—Don Salieri! Welcome, my friend! Welcome!

Don Salieri: Good to see you Pepé.

[They hug.]

Pepé: Yes! Ey… come! Our guest has arrived!

Don Salieri: What's on the menu today?

Pepé: My mother, she would be so honored if you tried her caponata.

{Caponata is a traditional Sicilian dish of stewed eggplant with onions, tomatoes and celery.}

Don Salieri: Excellente. Bravo, bravo. (Excellent. Well done, well done.)

Pepé: Molto bene. (Very good.) Oh, let me get you chair for you, ah? Sit, please. And to drink, a chianti. I've been saving this just for.

Don Salieri: Bene, bene, bene. (Good, good, good.)

[He pours a glass of chianti for Don. Tommy refuses.]

Pepé: Enjoy. (leaves)

Don Salieri: I'm glad you're off the roof, Tom.

Tommy Angelo: Sarah threatened to leave me if I didn't dry out.

Don Salieri: I know.

Tommy Angelo: She told you?

Don Salieri: No. I put her up to it. Drunkards get sloppy, Tom. I didn't want you to make a mistake we couldn't live with.

[Pepé brings two plates of caponata.]

Pepé: Ah, for you. And for you…

Don Salieri: Ah ha ha, Pepé! The meal is a masterpiece, as always.

Pepé: Molto grazie Don Salieri (Much obliged Don Salieri.). Praise from such a gourmet as you, it fill me with with joy.

Don Salieri: Ah, you wouldn’t call me a gourmet if you know what I had for supper.

[Pepé laughs. Meanwhile, a car pulls up to the restaurant with armed gangsters inside... Tommy notices it.]

Tommy Angelo: Get down!

[He turns the table over and hides behind it with the Don. The restaurant is shot with five tommyguns, turning it into a sieve. All the staff and the customers are killed.]

Don Salieri: What the hell...

Tommy Angelo: Morello!

Don Salieri: Bastard could've at least let me finish my wine....

Gangster: Hey Salieri! Come outta there, and we'll make this quick! Smoke him out, Joe.

[Joe throws a grenade into the small restaurant, most likely an MKII, with a kill radius of 5 meters and casualty radius of 15 meters.]

Tommy Angelo: Shit! Watch out!

[Tommy leads his boss away from the explosion and they somehow miraculously survive without any consequences. The restaurant is on fire. The Don’s car outside also takes heave damage.]

Tommy Angelo: We aren't going out the front door... Can you move?

Don Salieri: Not fast enough.

[He looks at the shotgun under the counter, behind which they are hiding.]

Don Salieri: We're going to ambush these boys. I'll keep them entertained while you slip out the back and circle around.

Tommy Angelo: You sure, boss?

Don Salieri: Blow them all down, Tommy. Not one of them goes home tonight.

Tommy Angelo: Okay, boss. Be careful.

Don Salieri: Tom. Just be quick about it.

[While Salieri distracts the gangsters at the front door, Tommy goes into the kitchen and kills the gangsters who decided to go around the back.]

Gangster: Got 'im! Over here!

Gangster: I see him!

Don Salieri: Go round the front and take 'em out Tom! Go! None of you are going home tonight!

Tommy Angelo: Boss! I got this! Try to keep your head down!

Gangster: You're finished!

Gangster: COMIN' THROUGH!

Gangster: Together!

Gangster: Angelo's coming through the alleyway!

[Tommy ambushes the gangster near the front door and kills them.]

Don Salieri: You still breathing Tommy?!

Tommy Angelo: Don Salieri! Boss! It's clear!

Don Salieri: Look at the balls on this kid... You really saved my ass Tom.

Tommy Angelo: We gotta go boss. The cops'll be here soon.

Don Salieri: I need a minute to catch my breath...

Tommy Angelo: Let me get you back to the bar.

Don Salieri: No. Not the bar. We're goin' to see Carlo. That son-of-a-bitch knew where I was going today, and he calls in sick?

Tommy Angelo: He set you up.

Don Salieri: Us, Tom. You could've ended up just as dead.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, I know boss.

Don Salieri: Carlo's shacked up with some dame in Holbrook. Let's go see what he has to say about all of this...

[Tommy steals a car and drives with the Don to Carlo's apartment.]

Don Salieri: Step on it Tom. Every minute Carlo's still breathing is a minute that's got me pissed.

Tommy Angelo: Sure, boss.

Don Salieri: (pissed as hell) Can't believe these bastards had the brass balls to wreck my car. Had to be Carlo, didn't it? His pop was tight with Morello. Right when we started out. Apple don't fall far from the tree, huh? I wept at his funeral. A his son's I'll be laughing loud. His mom's already a widow. Tom, and now he's going to make lonely till the day she dies. For what? Some dough to buy his dope, and my loot through his face. Know what? I'm glad. I'm glad this happened. I get to plug another rat - and we finally go to the mattresses with Morello. Today's the day the dam breaks.

Tommy Angelo: Sure feels like it.

Don Salieri: You take a guy in You give him a place in your family - you give him respect. And this, this is how he repays you?

Tommy Angelo: If he's done this, what else has he squealed on? The farm, the betting house, the ambush at the parking garage. Any of them could have been him.

Don Salieri: Jesus Christ someone's been ratting us out to Morello for years. And the time we work it out is when his guys come this close to bumping me off?!

[They arrive at Carlo’s apartment.]

Tommy Angelo: Boss, why don't you let me go first, huh? Carlo might be waitin' for us.

Don Salieri: No Tom. My face is gonna be the first and last thing this bastard sees.

[He kicks the door open. Carlo is fucking some girl in the meantime.]

Carlo: What the fuck!

Don Salieri: You goddamn dirty grifter!

[He punches Carlo.]

Tommy Angelo: You'd better dangle, sweetheart.

[Salieri punches Carlo several times and then breaks a bottle over his head. Afterwards he becomes unwell.]

Tommy Angelo: You okay, boss.

Don Salieri: Yeah. Just a little winded. Let me catch my breath.

[Carlo pushes Salieri and jumps out the window onto the fire escape.]

Tommy Angelo: Jesus, he's fast for a big guy.

Don Salieri: Don't let him get away!

[Tommy runs after Carlo.]

Carlo: Help! Help me someone!

Tommy Angelo: Come back here Carlo!

Carlo: They're going to kill me!

Tommy Angelo: Hey, we ain’t finished with you!

Carlo: Tommy! Please! I can explain! Think about this Tom! Please! Let me talk to the boss! I can explain everything! Tommy, you've got to know! Morello: he was going to kill Mom! I had to do it. I had to! They made me do it Tommy! Please! I can explain!

Tommy Angelo: There's only so many rules in this life. You broke 'em all.

[When Carlo tries to climb over the scaffolding, Tommy shoots him. Salieri walks in.]

Don Salieri: Is he still alive?

Tommy Angelo: I'm not sure.

[Carlo lays on the ground, twitching. Salieri smashes his head into a bloody mess with his boot. After that, he spits on the corpse.]

Don Salieri: Now we're sure.

[The scene changes to Morello's headquarters. He personally beats up some poor guy tied to the ceiling with his mouth tied.]

Don Morello: Hey Sergio, how are you? Keeping out of trouble?

Sergio: Sure. Who's this? Wait a minute… Is that Gordy? It is! Hey Gordy, how you doin’ buddy, I hardly recognized you. What he do?

Don Morello: You said you were having trouble down at the docks, right?

Sergio: Yeah, but it's nothing I can't handle.

Don Morello: Yeah well, I did some asking around. This asshole was planning a strike. Strike's are no good for business. Unless you're the one calling for it, right?

Sergio: Right.

Don Morello: So, I decided the union needs a change in leadership. That alight with you?

Sergio: Course.

Don Morello: Good. Now, what about that other thing?

Sergio: That's why I'm here. Salieri's still alive.

[Morello throws a chair in rage.]

Don Morello: God damn it! What happened?

Sergio: I don't know yet. The crew we sent is dead, restaurant's all shot to hell.

Don Morello: Stop your crying. We're trying to have a conversation here. What about cockroach Carlo?

Sergio: We found him with his head smashed in, like a fucking watermelon. I've never seen anything like it...

Don Morello: Salieri must've figured out Carlo was the rat. 

[Gordy groans in pain.]

Don Morello: Goddamn, I can't even hear myself think.

[Gordy continues to groan.]

Sergio: There's going to be a war.

Don Morello: I told you to shut the fuck up.

[He shot Gordy five times.]

Don Morello: We've been at war since we killed Peppone. It's just out in the open now.

Sergio: What do you want me to do?

Don Morello: Make your rounds. Tell all the boys to keep their eyes peeled and their powder dry.

Sergio: Okay. I'll put the word out.

Don Morello: Hey. Just keep your head down, little brother.

Sergio: You too, Don Morello.

Chapter 14: Happy Birthday (1935)
[Tommy comes to Salieri's restaurant. The place is full of his men. They are ready for war.]

Gangster 1: We're at the start of something - something big.

Gangster 2: You think?

Gangster 1: Morello tried to kill the Don. Not Tommy… not Paulie... not anyone regular… the Don. It's gonna be war.

Gangster 2: I'm ready for them.

Gangster 1: I hope so.

Luigi: You're needed upstairs.

Tommy Angelo: I'll go straight up.

[The entrance on the back side of the mission is guarded by Luigi and several gangsters with tommyguns.]

Luigi: It's war. Tom. From today, we are at war.

[Tommy goes upstairs to the Don’s office.]

Gangster 1: (to Tommy) It true the Don slipped Carlo the bump? Not you?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. Wasn't pretty.

Gangster 2: Still blood in his veins, huh?

Gangster 1: Less in Carlo's.

[Approaching the office, Tommy hears Salieri and Vincenzo talking.]

Don Salieri: I want guards and look outs round the clock; here, the warehouse and all our businesses.

Vincenzo: How about the people under our protection?

Don Salieri: Forget about them. We stick to our own till this is over. I'll remember who picked the wrong side.

[Tommy enters the office.]

Vincenzo: Our guy's in place.

Don Salieri: Good.

Tommy Angelo: We're finally going after him?

Don Salieri: Soon. But first, we have to soften him up. Morello's got the cops, the politicians, and even some judges in his pocket. We can't afford to buy them all off, so we need to scare them into abandoning Morello's sinking ship.

Vincenzo: We bump off the right idiot, the rest are going to realize sticking with Morello ain't too good for their health.

Don Salieri: First in line for the pine box is this asshole, Ghillotti. The Councilor is still seeing red over his dead kid, so he's never going to turn on Morello.

Tommy Angelo: Christ, that guy's been giving us fits since '32. Let me take care of him, boss.

Don Salieri: Why do you think you're here? Vinny's got it all figured out.

Vincenzo: The councilor is celebrating his birthday with a big shindig on a steamboat. He's pulling out all the stops, Booze, broads, fireworks. He's even giving a speech to the press.

Tommy Angelo: What kind of security?

Vincenzo: Just his normal detail, a few guys with roscoes. None of the other fellas are gonna do dick to protect that piece of shit.

Tommy Angelo: Okay. I'll talk my way into the party and put two in his head.

Vincenzo: Slow down junior. Ghillotti is corrupt, but he ain't stupid. His crew will be searchin' everyone who comes on board, so you can't be carryin'.

Tommy Angelo: So, what, throw him overboard, see if he can swim?

Vincenzo: Don't go gettin' creative on me. You're still gonna shoot him, for fuck's sake... When you get on deck, you make for the head. We got a janitor on the take, and he's planted a revolver in the bathroom.

Don Salieri: And then you just cool your heels. Mingle. Try not to look like a hatchet man until Ghillotti makes his appearance. Vou wait for that bastard to start his speech, and only then do you put one between his eyes.

Vincenzo: We want it done in public, to get people talking.

Tommy Angelo: Sure. But you got a plan for getting back to shore?

Vincenzo: Sam and Paulie are down the docks working on that. You meet up with them there, and they'll fill you in on the rest of the details.

Tommy Angelo: Okay. Ghillotti's done, boss. You won't have to worry about him after tonight.

Don Salieri: I don't doubt it, Tommy.

Vincenzo: Buona fortuna (good luck), Tom.

[Tommy drives to the docks. There's a huge, luxurious steamer moored there. A lot of people had gathered at the pier. Tommy is looking for Sam.]

Loudspeaker: Attention folks, attention. We'll get you all aboard - but we will need to see tickets. You'll also be searched for safety. Thank you for your patience.

Man: The finest family in the city.

Woman: No doubt in my mind. Who's done more?

Man: And all this after the loss of his son!

Woman: He's gonna clear up this city you know. And he can throw one hell of a party.

Dorothy: Terrence you got an invite too!? Did you hear there's gonna be fireworks?!

Terrence: Ah, Dottie - yes I...

Dorothy: Who is this Terrence? I'm not sure we've been introduced?

Terrence: Uh, Dorothy - this is my wife, Barbara.

[Tommy finds Sam. He is standing at the door leading to the administrative part of the docks.]

Sam: Over here, you mook! You don't look like a guy with an invite.

Tommy Angelo: I got friends just not these kinda friends.

Sam: Well I'll tell you what I got. A sailor back there who works on the steamer. His head hit something heavy - but his dandy white suit's fine.

Tommy Angelo: Thanks. I'll go find him.

[Tommy finds the sailor in the bathroom. He changes into his clothes.]

GHILLOTTI SECURITY DEMANDS
To Whom It May Concern,
I write in reference to my forthcoming event on the Lost Heaven Queen.
I was today warned by an associate about a potential threat to my safety. As such, I will be bringing my own security staff to the party.
I also expect the following:
1) Only those holding tickets will be allowed on-board
2) Your crew will NOT be admitted into the bar area. I will only be mixing with my closest friends here. 
3) All the Lost Heaven Queen crew MUST be on the lookout for suspicious behavior.
Roberto Ghillotti

Sam: Knew you'd get a real job some day. So remember - play it cool. When you've gone some ways over the water, find the gun. The janitor's stashed it in a bathroom.

Tommy Angelo: Sure.

Sam: Then get up on the roof. wait for Ghillotti's speech and pop him when he's done.

Tommy Angelo: And how do I get away?

Sam: Paulie's borrowed a speedboat. After the speech there's fireworks. We'll come soon as we've seen 'em.

Tommy Angelo: You better be there on time.

Sam: Don't worry. It'll go smooth like eggs in coffee.

Paulie: Looking good Tom! If the outfit don't get messed up: keep it. Suits you.

[Tommy goes to the gangway. There he is greeted by an employee of the steamer.]

Employee: So you're the new guy? Christ, you took your time.

[Tommy passes on the steamer. Paulie watches him go.]

Paulie: You think he's gonna pull this off?

Sam: He's sure a shit gonna kill Ghillotti. But gettin' off that boat... Well, he's gonna need a guardian angel.

Paulie: He don't need no fuckin' angel. He's got us lookin' out for him.

[The steamer slowly sails away. Tommy pretends to be an ordinary sailor. He washes the windows. A sailor comes up to him.]

Sailor: Hey you almost done?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. Was gonna go clean the bathrooms. Heard some guests
complaining.

Sailor: You're volunteering to clean the toilets? Ach... whatever. You got a rag there, check every deck.

The scenic views of the Saint Paul Coast will then be yours to take in as we approach the fireworks barges set up in preparation for our grand event!

Sailor 2: Don't I know you from someplace?

Tommy Angelo: Nah. Don't think so.

Sailor 2: I swear I know you. Were you with the union maybe?

Tommy Angelo: Sorry buddy. I'm from out of town.

Sailor 3: Listen, shipmate, go someplace else.

Tommy Angelo: Know where I can find the janitor?

Sailor 4: Back of the boat, drunk as a skunk in the engine room. Same as always.

Tommy Angelo: Figures. Thanks.

Janitor: You took your... time! Tommy - right? I hid the gun in the john on the stern. Mid-deck.

Tommy Angelo: Where's ‘stern’?

Janitor: Next floor up. Right above us. Key's on the table there.

[Tommy takes the keys.]

Tommy Angelo: You ever say my name again, and you'll be found floating outside - get that?

Janitor: Uh, yeah. I get that.

[Tommy goes to retrieve the gun.]

Sailor 2: I do know you! You're with Salieri.

Tommy Angelo: And what are you gonna do about it?

Sailor 2: Well, I'm gonna give you a beating for starters.

[Tommy knocks him out and throws him overboard. After that, he goes into the toilet and, standing on the john, tries to pull the gun out of the cistern.]

Tommy Angelo: Come on... Where the fuck are you…

[He finds the gun behind the john. It is a small six-shot revolver. I'm pretty sure it's a compact Colt Detective Special that was first produced in 1927. After hiding it under his clothes, Tommy comes out of the toilet and takes up a firing position on the balcony. Ghilotti comes out to the gathered people.]

Ghilotti: Hey, John! Hope you're enjoying yourself?

John: As long as the bar stays open, Councilor.

Ghilotti: Ha ha, good man. Have another for me. (shakes someone’s hand) Good to see you. Thanks for coming.

[He begin his speech.]

Ghilotti: Thank you everyone, thank you! And welcome to my little party. right? So, as you all know, it has been a tough time. Three years ago my dear son, Billy left us. An innocent pawn in a deadly gang war. A victim of the disease that is organized crime. Since that day. I have lived only to eradicate this disease! Today is a day for celebration for my 50th birthday and for a brighter future for Lost Heaven! The criminals will be driven out of town! They'll drown like rats in the water! Thank you! Thank you everyone! And now for the fireworks, eh?

[On either side of Ghilotti, bright red fireworks light up. Tommy shoots... Panic ensues. It's time to leave the steamer.]

Guard: Got ya now!

Guard: Ah, crap!

Guard:  You guys hear that?!

Guard: We'll find him!

Guard: Found ‘im!

Guard: Gonna take ya down!

Guard: I'm moving up alongside him!

Guard: Say goodnight, punk.

Guard: Together!

Guard: There!

Guard: Hey you!

Guard: Over here!

Guard: Dead!

[Tommy is fighting for his life. Paulie and Sam come to the steamer.]

Paulie: Tom! It's us! Go! Go! Go!

[Tommy jumps on the boat and Paulie quickly sails away. They are followed by the buzzing of tommyguns and the rumble of fireworks.]

Chapter 15: You Lucky Bastard (1935)
[Several cars rush along a suburban highway at high speed at night. Sergio is driving the car in front. A car with Vincenzo and Sam behind the wheel is chasing him.]

Vincenzo: Stay on him!

Sam: What do you think I'm trying to do?

[Vincenzo shoots Sergio and only an accidentally tilted head due to the uneven track saves him from a bullet in the head. Cars are approaching the railway crossing.]

Vincenzo: He's tryin' to beat the train!

Sam: We can make it.

Vincenzo: Faster!

[Sam manages to dash in front of the train.]

Vincenzo: Ahh! Ha ha! Yeah!

[However, he does not cope with the control and his car crashes into a tree.]

Sam: Shit! A blow-out!

Vincenzo: Ahhh! God damnit!

[He tries to shoot at Sergio’s car, then throws the gun on the ground in a rage.]

Sam: That lucky bastard…

[They return to the restaurant with nothing but bruises.]

Paulie: I guess it could've been worse, huh? We could be peelin' you off the front of the train.

Sam: He just got a good break, is all.

Don Salieri: Sergio Morello's always been lucky. He was born with more brains than his brother, that's for sure.

Sam: We'll get him, boss.

Don Salieri: No. You two are off this job. You're broken mirrors on this one... We'll let the guy who killed Ghillotti take a crack. Tommy here has all the politicians scared. Maybe he can put Sergio in the ground.

Tommy Angelo: What do I need to know about this guy?

Vincenzo: Besides he's got a lucky rabbit's foot up his ass?

Sam: Sergio is Morello's top earner. He controls the unions, which means he controls the docks and can tax everything that's imported into the city. We kill him, and a big part of Morello's income will be wiped out.

Tommy Angelo: Any ideas on how to get to him? I don't want to end up in a tree like these two.

Vincenzo: You're gonna scatter his ashes. It's a custom job. Attach it to the starter under his car, and he'll be a human torch as soon as he turns the key.

Tommy Angelo: It's safe to carry?

Vincenzo: Just don't drop it. Or shake it. Or smoke near it. Yeah, it's safe. Boom! Woo! (laughs)

Don Salieri: Get it done, Tommy. For all of our guys Morello's killed, and all the money he's taken out of our pockets.

Tommy Angelo: I'll take care of it, boss.

[He wanders around a bit.]

Don Salieri: You still here Tom?

Vincenzo: That cafone (bastard) ain't gonna shoot himself. He's gonna need some help. Ah, still can't believe he got by that train. I’m losing my touch.

Sam: Sure you're old, Vinny - but you still got it.

Vincenzo: Old? What the hell did I say about old? I could still be a hundred and if he walked through my cross-hairs - his teeth would crack the sidewalk!

Paulie: You taught me everything I know Vinny, Sam don't mean nothing about it.

Vincenzo: Taught Paulie Lombardo everything he knows. Jesus. There's picture books with more in 'em…

[Tommy goes outside.]

Gangster 1: There's no way they'd come here.

Gangster 2: I used to run with his crew. If Morello wakes up one morning and wants to come heavy, he'll come heavy.

Gangster 1: Nah, nah he won't.

Gangster 2: He goes with his gut, and if there's one thing he's got its out.

Gangster 1: He'd see all of Little Italy burn?

Gangster 2: To the ground.

[Tommy goes to Sergio's house.]

Tommy Angelo: Yeh, that's gotta be Sergio's car. How am I gonna get through to it?

[Tommy goes into the next yard, climbs over the fence and quietly sets the bomb without attracting the attention of the guards. After that, he goes to the nearest phone booth and calls Sarah.]

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. I'll be home before supper. You wanna go dancing this weekend? Maybe drop the kid off at your pop's place?

[He notices that it is not Sergio who comes out of the house, but a woman, probably his wife.]

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. I'm still here. Oh Christ...

[He runs to Sergio's car waving his arms.]

Tommy Angelo: Hey! Stop!

[The woman ignores him and starts the engine. The car explodes and Tommy falls to the asphalt from the blast wave.]

Sarah: (from the phone) Tommy? Tommy!

Tommy Angelo: Oh, no, no…

Waitress: Oh, god! Oh my Lord! Oh God!

Sarah: Tommy? What's going on?

[Tommy returns to the booth and abruptly throws Sarah off. The housekeeper, who ran out into the street, waves her hands in hysterics. Tommy inserts another coin into the machine and dials Vincenzo.]

Waitress: Oh the poor young thing! I have to get her! Oh dear! Oh Why who would have done this?!

Tommy Angelo: (in panic) Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up. Vinny... It all went bad...

Vincenzo: Hey, pull it together, Tom. Whatever happened, happened. There's nothing you can do about it now. Sergio's luck is running out.

Tommy Angelo: What... What are you talking about?

Vincenzo: Sam and Paulie have found him. He's in Giorgi's restaurant across town. You need to get over there, fast.

Tommy Angelo: ...Okay.

[Tommy quickly gets in the car and drives away. In the distance, fire trucks are already howling. Tommy meets Sam and Paulie. Sam holds out his tommygun to him.]

Sam: Tom? You okay?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah... It's the car bomb... Things went south.

Paulie: We can jaw about it later. Right now, we gotta get that bastard. Let's go.

[They break out into the restaurant. Panic ensues.]

Sergio: What the hell…

[He's hiding behind a waitress.]

Paulie: We got a message from Mr. Salieri.

Tommy Angelo: Nooo!

[He pushes Paulie's machine gun, preventing him from killing the waitress.]

Sergio: Kill these clowns! (flees)

Paulie: Ah, God damn it! First we take you out, then it's your boss! C'mon Tom - pop these punks!

Sam: You enjoying your meal?! Tried the special fellas?!

Paulie: They got back-up!

Sam: I'm reloading!

Gangster: Get a taste a'this.

Sam: Rubbed 'em out.

Paulie: C'mon, we gotta push up-get after him!

Sam: Sergio's getting away!

Paulie: Tom! We gotta get Sergio!

Gangster: Get him!

Gangster: Over here!

Sam: They're all down, Tom.

[They catch up with Sergio at his armored car.]

Sergio: Get me outta here!

[Sergio and his driver rushes into the street.]

Paulie: Motherfucker!

Sam: He's gone.

[However, Tommy is not going to let Sergio go so easily. He steals a motorcycle and rushes off in pursuit.]

Paulie: (cheering) Ha ha! Go get 'em, Tommy!

Sam: C'mon! Let's get back to the car. We gotta catch up before that idiot gets himself killed.

[They get in their car and go after Tommy.]

Paulie: Tom! It's us!

Tommy Angelo: So get him!

Paulie: Gun it Sam!

Paulie: What are you doing! No!

Tommy Angelo: Ahhh!

[Tommy catches up with Sergio and forces him to stop.]

Sergio: What are you idiots doing?!? Kill that motherfucker! (hides) Get every guy we got down here, now!

Gangster: He's coming this way!

Gangster: Kill him!

Sergio: Get rifles up high! Pick him off! Get him in your crosshairs and pop his fucking skull!

[Gradually the battle moves to the railroad depot.]

Gangster: Burn ‘im!

Gangster: Molotov goin’ out!

Gangster: Right there!

Gangster: Take this!

Gangster: Got a shot!

Gangster: Burn him out!

Gangster: Molotov goin' out!

Gangster: End of the line...

Gangster: Burn him!

Gangster: Ey! Hey! HEY! Over here!

Gangster: Lining up a shot!

Gangster: You're outta here!

Gangster: Found him!

Sergio: What do I pay you for?! He's tearing the docks apart!

Gangster: Ya mine!

Sergio: Get rifles up high! Pick him off!

Gangster: Mister Morello! Get into the depot! We'll stop him!

Gangster: Burn him out!

Gangster: Firebomb!

[Tommy switches the levers at the train control center and smashes the gate of the train garage where Sergio is holed up.]

Gangster: Fuck! Fuck what happened?! Some kinda fucking train?!

Gangster: Over here!

Gangster: Huh?!

Sergio: What do you want? Money? I can get you money! You kill me and my brother will destroy everything you know! Come on! Let's finish this!

[He goes into the fuel storage room.]

Sergio: You just winged me, asshole! You think you're the guy who's gonna kill me?

[Tommy is about to shoot the wounded Sergio lying on the floor, but his Browning M1903 jams.]

Sergio: (laughs) What did I tell you? No one can touch me.

Tommy Angelo: You ain't that lucky, bastard.

[He pulls out a lighter.]

Sergio: Wait... No! Nooo! Ahh! Ahh! Ahhh!

[Tommy sets fire to the fuel spilled on the floor and runs away. Sergio is burned alive. As Tommy runs out of the building, there is a massive explosion.]

Chapter 16: Crème de la Crème (1935)
[In the streets of Lost Heaven, a full-scale war is taking place. Salieri's men against Morello's men.]

Tommy Angelo: (offscreen) After we killed Sergio, it was chaos for weeks. Our guys against their guys and Morello gone to ground. But a boss can't stay hidden forever. For a Don to be feared he's gotta be seen. Finally, word came through that he was gonna break cover.

Don Salieri: Morello wants to thumb his nose at us, take in a show like there's not a war on? We'll meet him in the streets.

Paulie: We do him like this. We wait outside the theater till the end of the show. All those rich assholes will start comin' out, and that's when we hit Morello and his gorillas. In a crowd, before they see us comin’.

Tommy Angelo: The theater's going to be packed... And not just with saps. There's a good chance the mayor, maybe even the chief might be there too.

Don Salieri: That's the goddamn point, Tom. We kill Morello in public, in front of the city's creme de la creme. Then they'll all know who's in charge. And it doesn't matter if you have a badge or a gavel or a fat wad of cash in your pocket. If you cross Salieri and his boys, you're dead.

Tommy Angelo: Okay, boss. We'll get it done.

Vincenzo: Take the machine guns. But make sure you don't draw attention to yourselves hanging around outside the theater. Keep the choppers hidden until you spot Morello.

Don Salieri: And then you light him up. I want it to look like that white suit is covered in roses. You got it?

Sam: Sure boss.

[They leave the office and go to the car.]

Paulie: This is it. We're finally doing this.

Sam: Keep your head. We gotta get to the theater before the show's over Tom, you're driving.

Paulie: We got the word boys. Morello dies tonight.

Gangster 1: Tonight? Shit.

Gangster 2: Good luck guys.

Paulie: I dunno how long theater plays go on for but it's gettin' late.

Tommy Angelo: Leave it with me Vin.

Vincenzo: I will. And... lot of good people lost in this war. Don't turn into one of 'em, eh?

[They get in the car and drive to the theater.]

Sam: Put your foot down, Tom.

Paulie: Can't believe after all these years we're finally goin' after Morello. Not his crew, not his family. Finally putting him in the ground.

Sam: We're puttin' a lot of history to rest.

Paulie: What happens when he's gone?

Sam: We'll be kings.

Paulie: Nah, I mean what happens with the Don. You think he'll be all tore up?

Sam: I think he'll start wearin' a nice new white suit… You boys doing alright?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, just sweatin' bullets.

Paulie: You look how I feel.

Sam: Nearly there, let's keep it together. When we see him - go for Morello. No one else.

Tommy Angelo: Once he's down - his guys will panic.

Paulie: We're actually doing this. He's been up against the boss for, what ten years?

Sam: More. You'd think that white suit would make him an easier target.

Paulie: I see him!

Sam: Let him have it!

[Morello comes out of the theater and notices Tommy's car. He hides behind his men. Paulie shoots but misses. A truck that happens to pull out gives Morello's car a chance to drive away.]

Sam: After him! Chase him down Tom, or the Don'll hang us out to dry!

Tommy Angelo: When I get close-shoot for the cars protecting him. Let's get 'em outta the picture.

Paulie: You got it.

Sam: Got cops on us!

Paulie: Bunch of 'em were staked out round the theater!

Tommy Angelo: Last time they get paid off by Morello. Tomorrow: they're ours.

Sam: They're sure giving some back, huh?

Paulie: Shit, this crate's taking too much.

Gangster: We're gonna throw some lead!

Paulie: Morello musta been plenty nervous. His guys are out in force.

Sam: Take 'em out if you can, but Morello's the prize tonight. C'mon fellas, we're takin’ this city over!

Paulie: If we lose ‘em, he'll go to ground for months. More maybe.

Sam: Don't let him give us the slip - he could be headed anywhere! If we don't catch up and plug him, he could head out of state for a while. We need to whack him tonight.

Gangster: He's ours.

Paulie: We work our way through his guys, then we come for him!

Sam: He's tryin' to shake us off in the back streets.

Tommy Angelo: I know this city better than anyone. Don't worry. This is gonna be a squeeze...

Sam: Morello's gotten himself a good driver, but he don't match you Tom.

Gangster: We got him!

Paulie: Jeez, these guys don't give up.

Sam: Neither do we. We're takin’ this all the way.

Paulie: Where's he goin’? He can't be skippin' town with us goin' bumper to bumper with 'em.

Tommy Angelo: Wherever he's going, he's going there in a hurry.

Sam: It's the air strip. He's gonna go in through the back.

Paulie: He's got a plane?!

Sam: Of course he's got a goddamn plane! There'll be more guys waiting...

Paulie: Good. We need to clean house. He's gotta die. His guys have gotta die.

Tommy Angelo: Okay, but let's keep us three off your list.

Sam: They only just fixed up the airport since the last time… 

[Morello's car pulls into the airport grounds. There are two guards with machine guns at the entrance.]

Sam: He's got muscle waitin'!

Tommy Angelo: I see 'em!

Paulie: Oh shit! God damn it!

[Tommy hits the guards at high speed and crashes into a building.]

Tommy Angelo: Everyone okay?

Paulie: Just a bit of glass in my hair. Nothing a cheap comb can't fix.

[He kills the surviving guard.]

Tommy Angelo: Then we go after him on foot. Come on!

Sam: The rest of their crew's comin' in! Behind you!

Paulie: Like them apples? He's down!

Gangster: Set his ass on fire!

Gangster: They cut him down!

Gangster: I see him!

Paulie: Reloading!

Gangster: You're finished!

Paulie: I clipped 'im! Ugh!

Gangster: Fire comin' down!

Gangster: Get up around 'em!

Paulie: Tommy! Look out!

Gangster: You bastards!

Gangster: Back me up, fellas!

Gangster: Throwing some fire!

Gangster: I'm on him!

Gangster: Got some heat here!

Gangster: Get up their side!

Paulie: It's gonna blow! Gotta reload!

Gangster: Got ya!

Paulie: Ugh!

Gangster: Together!

Gangster: Gah! They hurt me bad.

Sam: Behind you! The rest of their crew's comin' in!

Gangster: Got 'im! Over here!

Sam: Tommy! Look out!

Paulie: Some extra muscle comin' in!

Sam: Reloading!

Paulie: Some new goon's joinin' em!

Sam: Behind you!

Gangster: Got them on my back!

Sam: New goon inbound!

Gangster: Back me up!

Sam: One less asshole.

Paulie: Reloading!

Gangster: You bastards!

Gangster: Right here!

Gangster: Push up! Get a better shot!

Paulie: Son of a bitch just shot me!

Sam: Clipped ‘im! Gotta reload!

Gangster: They're trying ta pick me off!

Sam: He's down!

Sam: You guys hear somethin' through the back here? C'mon Tom! Morello's gotta be close!

Paulie: Into that car!

Sam: Tommy. Up front! You're the best shot outta all of us!

[They get in the car and follow the accelerating plane.]

Paulie: Come on! He's gettin' away!

Don Morello: Get us into the air!

Pilot: We don't have the speed!

[Tommy shoots at the plane. Morello puts a gun to the pilot's head.]

Don Morello: Take us up!

Sam: It's gonna take off! Shoot out the engines!

Paulie: Are we even makin' a dent? It's no good!

Sam: Okay! Now the other!

Paulie: Blow 'em both!

Sam: This isn't gonna work!

Tommy Angelo: It has to work!

Sam: He's in a fucking plane!

Tommy Angelo: Can it and let me shoot! 

[The plane's engines catch fire, but the plane still manages to take off.]

Tommy Angelo: He's not outta here yet. 'Cause I'm the guy that drives! And now we got a plane to catch!

Sam: Okay here's what's happenin'. We follow it, we see where it lands, we rush in all guns blazin' and we finish them off.

Sam: No way that bird's stayin' in the sky.

Paulie: That thing's not gonna land. It's gonna crash. It look...... aeronautic to you?

Sam: Thank Christ we got you in the car professor.

Tommy Angelo: Morello's not gonna walk away from a plane crash.

Sam: That's a maybe, but he ain't dead till we've seen him dead. Outta all of us you two should know that by now.

Paulie: Where's he tryin' ta take it?

Tommy Angelo: Maybe out near the race track. More chance of landing it safe outside the city.

Paulie: He'll land maybe, but it's not gonna be safe.

Tommy Angelo: Wherever he comes down, we'll be there soon after.

Sam: Is it gonna go?

Paulie: Yep.

Tommy Angelo: Yeh. It's goin'.

[Morello's plane finally goes down. Tommy brings the others to the crash site. Morello climbs out of the burning plane, covered in blood. He is writhing in agony - he must have injured his head in the fall.]

Sam: Jesus Christ...

Paulie: The bastard's dead and he doesn't even know it yet…

[Tommy empties a clip from his tommygun into Don Morello.]

Tommy Angelo: He knows it now.

Paulie: Yeah pal. That'll do it.

Sam: Come on. Let's make tracks.

[Meanwhile, in the restaurant, Salieri looks at a photograph of Morello, him and some other mafioso. Luigi arrives and brings a bottle of alcohol and two glasses.]

Don Salieri: See you on the other side, Marcu.

[He sips from his glass.]

Intermezzo (Interlude) (1938)
Detective Norman: You fucking phantom... I've been chasin' you for three god damn years. You'll do life for this. Tom. Or maybe even the chair.

Tommy Angelo: You don't want the guy who was punchin' tickets. You want the guy who was handin' them out.

Detective Norman: So that's what all this has been about why you're offerin' up Salieri...

Tommy Angelo: The Don's books, the ones Frank stole... I have 'em. They're enough to put Salieri away forever, and they're yours. Assuming we have a deal. My family for the Don.

Detective Norman: You recognize anyone? Look again. The old man, that's Don Peponne. The two younger guys are Morello and Salieri.

[He holds out to Tommy the very picture Salieri was looking at.]

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, okay. I see it. That must be, what, 1920?

Detective Norman: April. Morello's wedding. Salieri was the best man.

Tommy Angelo: Jesus, they're just kids.

Detective Norman: And already soldiers in Peponne's mob. So what happened? How did they go from being bestimates to Morello on the slab?

Tommy Angelo: I don't know… I didn't even know they were friends.

Detective Norman: (laughs) What you don't know could fill up the fuckin’ Chrysler building.... In '22, Peponne drowns up at the lake. In order to keep things running smoothly, Salieri and Morello agree to divvy up the city.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, I heard the story. So what?

Detective Norman: Their friendship should have made the deal work, but... didn't make a lick of difference.

Tommy Angelo: After Morello. Salieri was beamin', thinkin' we ran the whole damn town. Me, I was just happy the war was over. But then I got to thinking about something... What good was all of Morello's money if it couldn't protect him from a regular Joe like me? A cabbie for Christ's sake… It only got him one thing: a great big bullseye on his fucking forehead. And that thought, it just kept turning around and around in my head, until one day I'm looking in the mirror, and I start seeing the bullseye too. Right here. (touches his forehead)

Detective Norman: You dry your tears with a wad of hundreds, do you?

Tommy Angelo: I wasn't about to give up the good life, I know that. I just told myself I was smarter than Morello. That I wouldn't turn around one day and find Paulie or Sam pointin’ a gun at my head. The thing is, you don't see it when you're out on the street scrapping, fighting for your life. Then, the guy next to you isn't just your partner, he's your brother. You'd stick a knife in someone for your brother, right? But at night, you lie awake wondering what he and the Don were whisperin’ about behind the bar. Wonderin' if your best friend is hungry enough to betray you.

Chapter 17: Election Campaign (1938)
[Tommy brings Don Salieri an envelope from a recent collection to his office.]

Don Salieri: Any trouble?

Tommy Angelo: No, boss. No trouble at all.

Don Salieri: Got something else for me?

[Tommy pulls out two more envelopes.]

Don Salieri: Paulie's feels a little light.

Tommy Angelo: There's a little extra in mine to cover the difference.

Don Salieri: You ever go swimming, Tom?

Tommy Angelo: Been to the shore a few times, sure.

Don Salieri: I knew a couple of guys once, took some dames out to the lake. Had a few beers, a few laughs, then one of them decides to go in the water. He gets to the center of the lake and realizes he's running out of steam, can't make it back in. He starts shouting for help. Now the other guy, he's a strong swimmer. He goes out in the lake to drag his buddy back to shore. Problem is, the first guy, the one ton stupid to know when the water's too deep for him, he panics. Grabs his friend by the neck and they both go under and don't come up again. Paulie's your friend, and I know you're loyal to him, and I respect that. But don't you ever pay his tab again.

Tommy Angelo: Okay boss.

Don Salieri: Good. Now, we gotta talk about this Turnbull.

Tommy Angelo: The guy running for Governor?

Don Salieri: The same. He's been flapping his gums a lot about cracking down on our businesses.

Tommy Angelo: That's rich. He's spent more on whores than Paulie and Sam combined. You want me to pay him a visit? Maybe put him on the take?

Don Salieri: No. You can't trust a hypocrite, Tom. We need to end his campaign aspirations, and in a way that keeps anyone from stepping up to the same platform.

Tommy Angelo: Vinny have a plan, then?

Don Salieri: Of course. Turnbull's holding a rally near Central Island. The spot he picked is hard to reach, and out in the open. You should have a beautiful view of the rally from the tower of the old prison. From there, you can give Turnbull the third eye.

Tommy Angelo: Okay, I'll go see Vinny about the gun.

Don Salieri: But don't forget you've only got one shot. You miss, and his crew will usher him out of there quick.

Tommy Angelo: I'm the best shooter you got. Otherwise, you'd be talking to someone else.

Don Salieri: Then get it done.

Woman: Hey handsome.

Tommy Angelo: Ladies.

Woman: You're wasted on that wife of yours. You know that?

Woman 2: Ah, he'll never look our way. He's a good boy.

Gangster 1: If everything you say is true, we'll have a deal. Once the Don has approved.

Gangster 2 : It is. It's good stuff.

Gangster 1: Our customers expect only the best. We run this city, and to make sure it stays that way - the best is what they get.

NEWSPAPER-JULY 15TH 1938
Former Lost Heaven Congressman Hank Turnbull today begins his gubernatorial campaign with a rally at Robinson Park. Turnbull retired from politics in 1932, but felt compelled to return to public service after the infamous 'Birthday Massacre' that saw the death of his friend and fellow councilman Roberto Ghillotti. Turnbull's pledge to battle gangsterism will certainly garner support in his home state, which last week posted record crime figures for the tenth consecutive year.

Luigi: Another man blind to how this city works, and always has.

Tommy Angelo: He'll know soon enough.

Bartender: Got a cola with your name on it, when you're done for the day. You should have seen the place last night. Heavin'!

[Tommy visits Vincenzo. He cleans up a sniper rifle that looks close to  M1903 Springfield.]

Vincenzo: Hey, Tommy.

Tommy Angelo: The Boss says you've got something for me?

Vincenzo: I got a shipment in from a guy at Fort Stanmore. Salieri wants this to run like clockwork. So no heat till the guy's head bursts. I had Little Tony stash one of these where you need it.

Tommy Angelo: So, up high in the old prison?

Vincenzo: Yeah, the family's got a lot of history in that place. Hoods who live there now ain't so classy. So watch yourself. Little Tony locked the rifle up tight in a room with a view. Up on the top floor. I'm sick of that politician's shit in the papers, Tommy. We own this town now. Right between the eyes, huh? Find a way inside and make for the guard tower. The top deck is locked, that's what the key is for.

[Tommy arms himself and goes to the Prison. He finds a way to get behind the fence.]

Prisoner: Hey fella, come over. You with Tony?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah.

Man: Your friend said you wanted the guard tower paid me to mark the way with this sign. Folks go through the sewer. Only way in. Then just keep heading up. 

Man 2: (screaming) Hey! You down there! We ain't going nowhere. Turn around!

[Tommy goes down into the sewers.]

Man 3: You a cop?

Tommy Angelo: No.

Hobo 3: Well you ain't one of us. You're not welcome here. I'm warning you, mister...

Hobo 4: Why can't you people just leave us be? This is our home. Why can't you people understand that?

Hobo 5: That you, cop? You're locked up tight! Not getting in! Someone's coming through!

[Tommy finds his way into the Prison. Next he needs to follow hobo signs to get to the Guard Tower.]

Hobo 6: (vomiting) Rotgut... Moonshine... Bullshit! What the hell was in that stuff?

Hobo 7: You look lost… You need a little help?

Tommy Angelo: You know the guard tower?

Hobo 7: It's up through the main cell block. Gates locked most of the time, to keep the Feds out.

Tommy Angelo: Thanks.

Hobo 7: Be careful in here stranger. We're protective of our own.

Hobo 8: Have you seen my son? I can't find him. I woke up and he was gone. David? David, where are you?

Hobo 9: Ey, who's this?

Hobo 10: You bring trouble.

Hobo 11: Nice shoes. Hand 'em aver. Or don’t. We'll beat you anyway.

Hobo 12: You deaf? Beat it! Guys like him, they listen to guys like me - see?

Hobo 13: Son of a… Picked a fight you'll lose! Aah!

Hobo 14: What ya got greaser!?

Hobo 15: I thought there'd be more of you to evict us.

Tommy Angelo: Am I close to the guard tower?

Hobo 15: Real close. The elevator is out, but you can take the stairs.

[Tommy climbs the spiral staircase to the top of the tower. There he finds a sniper rifle and takes aim. In the distance, Turnbull takes the podium to give a speech... Tommy pulls the trigger.]

Dispatch: (via radio) Report of gunfire at the Turnbull rally! Turnbull is down! The shot came from the old prison!

[Tommy goes down the stairs quickly, but it does not hold and he falls down and loses consciousness.]

Tommy Angelo: Shit. How long have I been out?

[He finds a way out of prison. In the distance, police sirens wail.]

[Tommy drives home.]

Sarah: Did you hear about this Turnbull?

Tommy Angelo: Heard he was crooked as the day is long.

Sarah: Says in the paper, he's gonna be remembered for lightin to pass the 19th Amendment. Put his whole career on the line for it.

Tommy Angelo: Which one's that again?

Sarah: Women's suffrage, you idiot. He gave me the right to vote, Tom. Gave it to his wife and six daughters too. Guess nobody's just one thing, are they?

Tommy Angelo: Guess not. I gotta go to work.

Sarah: Tom, don't do nothin' you don't wanna be remembered for, you hear me?

Tommy Angelo: Probably too late for that.

Chapter 18: Just for Relaxation (1938)
[Salieri and his crew are smoking cigars in his office.]

Don Salieri: Excellent.

Paulie: Yeah. It's great boss.

Don Salieri: And this is just a taste. I got a line on a whole shipment of Cameroons that have been impounded by Customs. You guys are going to grab them.

Tommy Angelo: You want us to boost cigars?

Don Salieri: Something wrong with that? Customers in our nightclubs will pay through the nose for quality cigars.

Tommy Angelo: Still, it seems... I don't know. Small time.

Don Salieri: I always knew you were a smart one, Tom. Can't put nothing past you. Small time is exactly right. That's how it's supposed to look, anyhow. The cigars are just cover for a shipment of hot ice. The smuggled diamonds have been hidden in some of the boxes, but the Feds haven't found them yet.

Tommy Angelo: We're stealing diamonds from the Feds?

Don Salieri: Don't worry about it. I've already discussed all the details with Sam here. He'll fill you in. Now, I got a meeting with the mayor at his favorite gentleman's club. Work out the details together, but I want those cigars back here before anyone catches onto the real loot. You got it?

Tommy Angelo: Sure boss.

Don Salieri: Great. And don't drink all the good stuff while I'm gone.

[Salieri leaves the office.]

Tommy Angelo: You knew about this?

Sam: Boss and I worked it out last night. We got a plan. Now I'm not saying it's a good plan, but it won't get us killed. Probably.

Paulie: So, what, then? We got a guy on the inside or somethin'?

Sam: No. We gotta do this on our own. And it'll be rough. Cigars are packed in crates at the harbor.

Tommy Angelo: Shit. That place will be crawling with security.

Sam: Yeah, brute force won't work. We gotta play this one cool. So, we're gonna steal a customs truck, slip right in.

Paulie: Christ. We gonna kill the poor bastard driving?

Tommy Angelo: No. We'll just scare him a bit. All we need is his paperwork.

Sam: Right. We don't need the hassle of dumping a body. C'mon. See if we can get eyes on a customs truck down by the docks.

Paulie: You alright, Tom?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah... Just trying to figure out the angle, is all.

Sam: What's there to figure? Boss has a job needs doing, and we're doing it.

Tommy Angelo: Just seems like a lot to put on the line, even for some diamonds. The Feds pinch us, we could do serious time.

Sam: Then let's make sure we don't get caught, right?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah.

[They go outside. It’s nighttime.]

Sam: I got gear for the job stashed down near the harbor. If either of you need something special, go see Vinny.

Paulie: All I need is a stiff drink.

Sam: For Christ's sakes Paulie. Just lay off for one night. Please.

[Tommy visits Vincenzo.]

Vincenzo: Risky business tonight Tom. Take whatever you need. Remember when you got mader Shaking down stores, whacking small-time punks? Feels a long time ago, huh?

Tommy Angelo: The job don't change Vinny. One dead guy's the same as the next.

Vincenzo: Ah, enjoy it! All my life I wanted to be one of the big guys. And that's us now. We're living the dream, Tom. It don't get better. Never forget that. Back when I sided with Salieri, I lost a lot of friends. They said he wouldn't last a year. But I knew he'd bring it home one day. They don't say much now. You put most of them in a box.

[They're going on a mission. Paulie is playing with a gun.]

Tommy Angelo: Would you relax? You're making me nervous, playing around with your piece like that.

Paulie: Sorry. Just got a lot on my mind, is all.

Sam: (laughs) That so? I'd have figured there weren't enough room up there.

Paulie: Go ahead and laugh, assholes. You guys and the Don, none of you think I got plans. But you're wrong. I got big plans.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah? Spill it, then. What're you workin' on?

Paulie: Been thinkin' about hitting up a savings and loan downtown.

Tommy Angelo: You wanna rob a bank?

Paulie: Sure. I been casin' the place for months. I got it all worked out, I just need a few guys I can count on to watch my back.

Tommy Angelo: Robbin' a bank, that's a little outta our league.

Paulie: We're robbin' the fucking Feds, ain't we? What's the difference?

Sam: Salieri is the goddamn difference, you nitwit. The Don sent us to steal these cigars. But ain't no way he sanctions a bank job.

Paulie: Well then we don't tell him.

Tommy Angelo: You want to step out on the Don?

Paulie: Nah. Not really. We can cut him in after we make the score. He'll be bent, sure, but he won't stay mad once he gets his share.

Tommy Angelo: I don't know, Paulie...

Sam: Yeah I fucking know. You do what you want, I won't say nothin'. I owe you that much. But Salieri, he finds out you're goin' behind his back, you'll be planted right next to Morello. You ask me, there ain't no haul worth that.

Tommy Angelo: He's right, Paulie. Bring it to the Don, or let it go.

Paulie: I just get to day dreamin', you know.

Sam: Well, wake up. We're here.

[Tommy pulls over.]

Sam: Tom, you take the car. Find a customs truck and meet us near the impound. Me and Paulie, we'll go get the rest of the gear.

Tommy Angelo: Right. You got your head together?

Paulie: Yeah. I'm sober as a priest.

Tommy Angelo: That's what I'm afraid of...

Paulie: Ah, quit bustin' my balls. I'm good.

[Tommy runs to steal a Customs Truck. After that helena: returns to Paulie and Sam.]

Sam: Park up over there, Tom.

Tommy Angelo: Where's my uniform?

Paulie: Uh. This is all we got, pal. 'Sides, there's only room for two in the cab.

Sam: You can ride in the back. Be sure to keep your head down, or this whole thing is blown.

Tommy Angelo: Forget about it. I know when to keep my head down.

Paulie: Hmm. Bet you say that to all the girls.

Sam: C'mon!

[Tommy is hiding in the back of the truck.]

Paulie: Woah, woah, woah, woah...

Sam: Let's get moving!

Paulie: Alright, alright! Jesus Christ… You comfortable back there, Tom?

Tommy Angelo: What the hell do you think? What's the plan when we get to the impound?

Paulie: I don't know, we look for crates that came from Cameroon or something. The cigar place.

Tommy Angelo: You know how big the impound is?

Sam: Relax. It'll be empty this time of night. We'll have the run of the place.

[The truck stops at the gates.]

Guard: You got your papers?

Sam: Ah crap, yeah. Uh, Pete... you got the papers?

Tommy Angelo: The dash!

Guard: What was that?

Sam: What was what?

Guard: What?

Paulie: Here you go, pal.

Guard: Alright, go through. Busy night tonight, you might not find a spot.

Paulie: Hear that? There's going to be guys everywhere!

Sam: It'll be fine. We just got to think on our feet.

Paulie: Thinking on my feet is my worst thing Sam! You know that.

Worker: What kind of time do you guys call this? We need to have gone through these shipments by sun up!

Paulie: Yeah. Sorry, we couldn't find our papers... but we found 'em again.

Sam: Just show us what to do pal. We're new.

Worker: We're all new buddy. It's just that some of us know what time we have to clock in. Come with me!

Sam: Okay Tom, looks like it's on you. Get into the warehouse and find the cigar crate that's hiding the diamonds.

Tommy Angelo: Okay.

Sam: They keep records on everything here - so search their files. You're looking for Cameroon Cigars that came in on a boat called The Bohemia. Ship docked on Tuesday 23rd. Got that?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah.

Sam: Don't get caught. Don't get seen. Come find us when you're done.

[Tommy tries to find his way in…]

Tommy Angelo: Feds have got guys working overtime tonight...

Worker 2: Needle in a haystack ain't even the fucking word.

Worker 3: Just look for something, anything out of place.

Worker 2: No way are we going to get through all these crates. Not even in a week!

Worker 3: So you get paid for a week! Quit complaining!

Worker 4: Even if I knew. I couldn't tell you. The guys back in D.C. got wind that something big's come through here. Something worth finding. The assistant director's not going to sleep till he knows what it is.

CUSTOMS SEARCH NOTE
Howie,
I took a cigar crate out of the warehouse. I have a hunch some of the Cameroons we impounded when the Bohemia docked might be hiding what we're looking for.
When you come in-get into the warehouse and check the rest of the boxes.
See you in the morning. Good luck.

Tommy Angelo: Huh! This'll help.

Worker 5: C'mon fellas, let's speed this up. Once we're done with the small crates, we start cracking open the big ones next door.

Worker 6: Money's good, but boy these feds are assholes. Must've been through a hundred boxes already… Fuck me. I'm fucking tired… This is God damn endless…

[Tommy finds some documents.]

[He searches for the crates and knocks out the workers.]

Tommy Angelo: Nothing in here… Found them!

[Sam and Polly drive the truck to the loading zone.]

Paulie: Here he is.

Sam: You sure we're getting what we came for?

Tommy Angelo: We're aces, boys.

Sam: Good. Let's get 'em loaded and get outta here. That's the last of 'em.

Tommy Angelo: Let's dangle. I'm not riding in the back again.

Paulie: You're a better wheelman anyway. Just don't drive us into the bay.

[The alarm goes on.]

Sam: Shit... You hear that? Okay Tom, gun it!

Paulie: Let's go, let's go!

[He jumps in the back of the truck.]

Paulie: Jesus Tom, it ain't comfortable back here, huh?

Tommy Angelo: Through the gate!

Dispatch: (via radio) There's been a break-in at the Federal Customs Impound! Suspects are escaping in a customs truck. I want roadblocks everywhere.

Paulie: Every cop in town's got to be on their way!

Sam: So let's get out of sight - fast as you can, Tom.

Paulie: Another checkpoint.

Sam: Give it a wide berth Tommy.

Dispatch: (via radio) Anyone seen the truck? Call in with news fellas. Where are they? Feds will have our guts for garters over this. Again.

Sam: Feels like we left them behind.

Paulie: Yeah. Hopefully.

Sam: Where the hell were you back in the compound? We were about to give up.

Tommy Angelo: Place was a maze. It's a miracle I found the crates,

Paulie: Next time we pull something like this, we need a better plan. More information.

Sam: A better plan? He got the ice didn't he?

Paulie: Yeh, but next time...

Sam: Next time what? We run it all through you, as scores like these are your best thing?

Tommy Angelo: Guys, I'm trying to drive here. Let's get back to the warehouse without LHPD on our tail - huh?

Sam: Sure.

Tommy Angelo: We got the diamonds, the boss'll be happy. That's all that matters right now.

Paulie: Those rocks had better be as big as the God damn Ritz for all the crates we had to move tonight.

[Tommy stops the truck.]

Tommy Angelo: Hey, Paulie! You okay?

Paulie: Yeah, yeah. Couple of these crates are shot to shit though…

Sam: How bad is it?

Paulie: This is the worst of it.

Sam: Uh, don't look too good... Don's gonna be pissed if we ruined any of the cigars.

[Tommy opens one of the cigar boxes…]

Tommy Angelo: What the hell...

Sam: Christ... It's dope.

Paulie: You sure?

Sam: Yeah. I'm sure.

Paulie: Where are the diamonds?

Tommy Angelo: There ain't any. This is the real score.

Paulie: Nah. Nah, nah... the Don said we were gettin' diamonds...

Tommy Angelo: You can open every box. You're not gonna find them.

Paulie: We put our fuckin' necks out on the line for this shit?

Sam: Looks like it.

Tommy Angelo: You better cool off, Paulie. The Don's comin'.

Paulie: Shit...

Sam: We don't say nothin' about this to the Don. If he wanted us to know, he would've told us.

Tommy Angelo: He should have come clean.

Sam: Sure. But, for now, we keep our traps shut. Right?

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, okay.

Sam: Paulie?

Paulie: Yeah, yeah. I aint sayin' nothin'.

[Salieri approaches.]

Don Salieri: Any problems, boys?

Tommy Angelo: One of the crates got a little banged up, is all.

Don Salieri: That right? Ah, doesn't look too bad.

Sam: Might've lost a few cigars, but otherwise the merchandise should be okay, boss.

Paulie: 'Sides, ain't diamonds supposed to be the hardest thing around?

Brute: Outside a' my cock, maybe.

Don Salieri: Well, bravo boys. Bravo. You all got a well-deserved bonus coming your way.

Tommy Angelo: You want us to unload the crates into the warehouse?

Don Salieri: No. You can take a powder. These morons are gonna take it from here.

Paulie: You sure?

Don Salieri: What'd I say?

Paulie: Okay, boss. We'll dangle.

[Polly is extremely upset by what's happening.]

Don Salieri: Sam, give me a lift back to the bar.

Sam: Sure, boss. You guys comin'?

Tommy Angelo: Nah. We'll take the train.

Sam: Okay. See you later.

[He leaves.]

Paulie: God damn it. I just about had it. Tommy. We got busted with all that smack, we would have died in prison!

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, but what are you gonna do?

Paulie: I already told you.

Tommy Angelo: The bank?

Paulie: Yeah. I don't care what Sam says. I'm getting that score.

Tommy Angelo: How much d'you figure?

Paulie: You want in?

Tommy Angelo: We're just talking...

Paulie: I knew I could count on you, pal.

[They walk to the train station.]

Tommy Angelo: So which bank?

Paulie: Grand Imperial. Where North Park meets Downtown.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah. Been there. A while back.

Paulie: Well, the security don't look tight. Easy getaway. Tellers who don't look like they'd put up a fight. Can't do it alone…

Tommy Angelo: Maybe. I'm not moving black tar for the Don, especially if he's not cutting us in. And... I don't know...I just never want to be in that street again...

Paulie: What street?

Tommy Angelo: ...on my knees. Watching some poor skirt burn just because she got in our way.

Paulie: It was the wrong place and the wrong time. Just tough luck.

Tommy Angelo: Seems there ain't no other kind with us.

Paulie: I'm telling you, Tom, this is perfect. I wouldn't have asked you to come in on this if I didn't think it was our ticket.

Tommy Angelo: We'll see. I'm not signing up for the job until I see what's what. If I get pinched, Sarah's done with me.

[They board an empty train.]

Paulie: You got a family to look after. I get that. But think about what this could mean for them.

Tommy Angelo: Watch it, buddy. You're treading into enemy territory without a map.

Paulie: Yeah, I don't know what it's like for you, goin' home to your wife and kid. But that's why I'm doin' this. Who's gonna marry me, nearly forty years old and nothin' to show for it but my rap sheet? But, we do this, I get enough scratch to finally get out. Who knows?

Tommy Angelo: You ain't built for the domestic life, Paulie. Six months in, you'll put a bullet in your brain outta boredom.

Paulie: Christ. I'm ready to punch my ticket right now. We sit around for six months just playing cards and busting balls, then I start to get lazy. Then everything blows up, and I gotta knock the rust off or I'm dead. One day, I'm fighting to stay awake while the Don's telling us a story about the old days, one I’ve already heard a hundred times. And the next day: the next day I'm getting shot at, trying to keep from shitting my pants. Fuckin' wearing me out, Tommy…

[An elderly man walks on the train. Tommy and Paulie are stepping aside.]

Tommy Angelo: So, you're looking for the big one now?

Paulie: I know it's a snipe hunt. Every little mobster goes to bed dreaming about that last big score. But if we do this thing, I don't know, it might be just enough to get me a little pizzeria or something. You know?

Tommy Angelo: Sure. But, if we're doing this, we're waiting until things calm down.

Paulie: Ah, you're already hooked, pal.

Tommy Angelo: Maybe.

[He leaves. Paulie stays in the train and rides on.]

Chapter 19: Moonlighting (1938)
[We see the insides of Grand Imperial Bank. Tommy and Paulie discuss the plan.]

Tommy Angelo: Plan stays the same.

Paulie: Right. I take care of the crowd. You handle the manager. If threats don't work do what you gotta do. 

Tommy Angelo: Say a teller sounds the alarm - how long do we got?

Paulie: Five minutes, maybe more, before the cops show.

Tommy Angelo: What if it all goes to hell?

Paulie: I'm not fucking around Tom. You hear gunshots down at the vault don't come up. It's the money, or nothing at all.

[They get in the car.]

Paulie: We doin' this?

Tommy Angelo: We're doin' this.

[They reload their weapons and go inside the bank. Paulie hits the guard with the butt of his gun and Tommy shoots through the ceiling.]

Tommy Angelo: Everyone down on the floor.

Paulie: Get the fuck down!

Tommy Angelo: Not you, ladies. Stay where we can see your pretty faces.

Paulie: Anybody moves, I'll pop 'em! (to Tommy) Get the manager! (to the hostages) I need you all to stay on the ground! I see movement: people start getting shot! We all want everyone to get to go home and hug their kids tonight! Right?! No heroes! Not today! No kidding around. You all got that?

[Tommy enter the manager office.]

Tommy Angelo: With me! Down to the vault!

Manager: I'll do whatever you say. No-one needs to get hurt. This make you feel big? Beating on the little guy?

Tommy Angelo: It's making me feel rich - and the little guy gets to walk away if he doesn't do anything stupid. How many guards at the vault?

Manager: ...Оnе.

Tommy Angelo: He gonna shoot?

Manager: I... don't know.

Tommy Angelo: If I see a gun, he gets a bullet. So you tell him to stand down. It's all on you.

Paulie: Everything okay?

Tommy Angelo: Manager here's being good and cooperative - we're all doing what we're told. Aren't we buddy? Keep moving!

Manager: You won't get away with this. Your sort never do.

Tommy Angelo: You just worry about yourself. You want to see your daughter graduate from high school, you keep your hands where I can see them, and tell your guard to do the same. Remember when we get to your guard, you tell him to drop his gun. You got that?!

Manager: (to the guard) Listen to me very carefully. I need you to put down your…

[The guard reaches for his gun and Tommy kills him. A firefight ensues. As it turns out there are many guards.]

Bank Guard: Sick him boys!

Bank Guard: Shoot him!

Bank Guard: Bringing him down!

[Tommy kills the guards.]

Manager: (in shock) Vault key's on the table! No one else has to die! I don't have to die!

[Tommy opens the vault... There is so much money in it that it would take a truck to haul it all away.]

Tommy Angelo: ...Jesus, Mary an' Joseph…

[He tries to cram as much as he can into the bag.]

Paulie: Quit yer moanin'! Ah, damnit! The cops are here!

Tommy Angelo: Let's go! Get the money, it's time to go.

Policeman: Hands in the air! Surrender!

Policeman: Drop the money! The place is surrounded!

Policeman: Nowhere to run, boys!

Paulie: Take cover Tom!

Policeman: Get him!

Paulie: Let's go Tommy.

Policeman: Two suspects! Kill on sight!

Policeman: We got more cars en-route!

Policeman: Get everyone from the station! Everyone!

Policeman: Pin them down! Don't let them escape!

Paulie: Shit! Not this way! Follow me!

Policeman: We found him! Suspect on foot.

Policeman: We've got a roadblock set up. Should slow him down.

[Tommy and Paulie jump in their car.]

Tommy Angelo: Where?!

Paulie: Anywhere! Just lose the cops!

Policeman: On him!

Paulie: Stay down! Tommy! Look out!

Dispatch: (via radio) Officers reporting he's now in Holbrook. Officers in Holbrook. We've lost sight of him. Stay on patrol.

Tommy Angelo: Where now?

Paulie: The Palermo Club. 

Tommy Angelo: Sam’s club?

Paulie: Eh, it's empty right now. What he don't know can't hurt him. We're almost there Tom. We've almost done it!

Tommy Angelo: It still almost' Paulie. We'll only have done it once my heart stops trying to beat outside my chest.

[The hide the car in the Sam’s club garage. Tommy exhales in relief.]

Paulie: (happy) We did it! I can't believe we fuckin' did it! We're loaded! We're loaded.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah.

Paulie: For old time's sake?

Tommy Angelo: Sure.

[He sips from Paulie’s flask. Paulie is so happy he almost shits his pants.]

Tommy Angelo: We gotta go. I'll see you tomorrow?

Paulie: Unless I'm halfway to Hawaii… Ah, c'mon. I'm kidding. Hey, I couldn't have done this without you, know that. Go home, celebrate with Sarah. Come by my place in the mornin’, we'll split the dough.

Tommy Angelo: Yeah, okay. Good luck.

Chapter 20: The Death of Art (1938)
[Tommy comes home. Sarah prepares dinner.]

Sarah: Well, look at this. Christ has finally risen. I was gettin' ready to call the coroner.

Tommy Angelo: Sorry. Had a bit of trouble fallin' asleep, is all.

Sarah: Me too, thanks to you tossin' and turnin' all night.

[Tommy kisses his wife.]

Sarah: Okay, what'd you do?

Tommy Angelo: Just feelin' lucky, is all.

Sarah: Got that right, champ.

Tommy Angelo: But I been thinkin'...

Sarah: Oh yeah? I'll call the papers.

Tommy Angelo: I been thinkin' about takin' you and the kid out to the shore.

Sarah: You serious? Ain't you workin'?

Tommy Angelo: Paulie and me, we've come into some money.

Sarah: Huh. One of his cracked angles finally pay off?

Tommy Angelo: Somethin' like that. Pack a few bags. I'll swing by after I go 'round Paulie's.

Sarah: What ain't you tellin' me, Tommy?

Tommy Angelo: Nothing.

Sarah: Sure. You and Paulie are suddenly ilush, and now you wanna leave town for a few days? That don't square.

Tommy Angelo: What's the point of makin' a buck if we can't spend it?

Sarah: That ain't it… You're movin' even when you're standin' still. Yeah, you're nervous about somethin'... Probably, you don't even know why yet.

Tommy Angelo: That must be it.

Sarah: Well, you better figure it out before you get to Paulie's. Just in case it's him that got you all wound up.

Tommy Angelo: Ah. Paulie's alright. Don't worry about it.

Sarah: Then I guess I'll see you soon…

[Tommy drives to Paulie’s apartment. As he approaches his door, he sees that it is ajar. Tommy pulls out a gun. Once inside, he sees Paulie lying on the floor. He's dead.]

Tommy Angelo: Paulie? Ah, Jesus… Paulie? Ah God...

[Tommy checks Paulie's apartment for uninvited guests and then approaches his friend's body to grief. Tommy looks around the apartment for money but finds nothing. Suddenly the phone rings. Tommy hides behind a curtain and looks around outside. No one is there. He picks up the phone.]

Sam: Paulie?

Tommy Angelo: Sam? It's me... It's Tom....

Sam: Where's Paulie?

Tommy Angelo: He's... He's dead. I'm lookin' at him, slumped over in the hallway. Two in the fuckin' skull...

Sam: Oh god... I was... I was callin' to warn him...

Tommy Angelo: About what?

Sam: Jesus Christ, I owe you fellas my life, three times over...

Tommy Angelo: Warn him about what, Sam?

Sam: Salieri. He found out about the bank job. You're in deep shit, Tom. You gotta disappear.

Tommy Angelo: Okay. Okay... I just need some cash to get me and the girls outta town. Can you swing that?

Sam: Sure. Anything, pal. You want me to come to Paulie's? 

Tommy Angelo: No. No, I can't stay here... Meet me at the city gallery.

Sam: Yeah, okay. Keep your head down, Tom. 

Tommy Angelo: See you soon. And, thanks Sam.

Sam: I always pay my debts, Tom. You know that.

Tommy Angelo: Paulie. I gotta go. I'm sorry.

[Tommy gets in his car and drives to the city gallery. When he goes inside he is surrounded by Salieri’s men.]

Gangster: Don't move, Tommy.

Tommy Angelo: Shit...

Sam: Hey Tom.

[Sam sits on the upper gallery with a gun in his hands.]

Tommy Angelo: Sam? What the hell's going on?

Sam: You and Paulie. You put me in a bad spot.

Tommy Angelo: I know, Sam. And I'm sorry about that. But I need to get out of town. Can you help me or not?

Sam: There you go again... Making me choose between my friends and the family. This is what you were lookin' for at Paulie's. Here's your cut.

[He throws away a huge amount of cash. The money flies down like rain.]

Sam: It's more than you deserve.

Tommy Angelo: Sam... You killed him? You killed Paulie?

Sam: No. Paulie got himself killed.

Tommy Angelo: And you seem real tore up about it.

Sam: I'm just in a good mood. Things are right between me and the Don. I'm moving up. And I just found this big bag of money. The Don knows about Frank, Tom. The whore, too.

Tommy Angelo: That “whore”? The girl you were sweet on?

Sam: You're the one that let her live. I'm sorry about this, Tom. But our business has rules. It's a shame, too. Don Salieri really liked you. Guess we'll both have a good cry at your funeral.

Tommy Angelo: You think you're doing this because you're loyal. But you're not. You're just scared.

Sam: Maybe. But you'd have lived a lot longer if you'd have just looked over your shoulder from time to time. Goodbye. Don't let him suffer, boys. He's my buddy.

[Sam leaves. A gangster approaches Tommy from behind. Tommy snatches his gun and shields himself from the second gangster's shots, then runs for cover. Now he needs to fight for his life.]

Gangster: Over here!

Sam: Get down there now! The books are open for the guy that takes him down!

Gangster: Ya in my sights!

Tommy Angelo: Where'd you go, Sam....

Sam: Business is business, Tom! I know that you, out of all of 'em, know that. No more of your friends have to die today Tom. No one but you! Put him to sleep!

[Tommy follows Sam.]

Gangster: Right here!

Sam: Make your bones boys!

Gangster: We kill you, we get made!

Gangster: Got 'im! Over here!

Gangster: Sorry Tom. You'd do the same!

Gangster: Judas fuck!

Gangster: You don't eat alone! It's one of the only rules we got!

Gangster: You lying cheating fuck!

Gangster: Gonna die, cabbie!

Gangster: Say goodnight, punk.

Gangster: Molotov!

Sam: He's coming through! Give him the works!

Gangster: Seen him!

Gangster: I found ya!

Gangster: Throw some flames!

Sam: Lie down and take what's coming for you! Save me some time!

Gangster: You're gonna die today, you know that?

Sam: If you still had respect for the Don, would swallow this down! Catch!

Tommy Angelo: Fuck you Sam!

Sam: I know you'd do the same, Tom. Hell, I know you've done the same. This is getting serious boys! Take him out!

Gangster: Over here!

Tommy Angelo: Running outta guys yet?

Sam: It's still not over Tom!

Tommy Angelo: Salieri was ripping us off!

Sam: Ripping you off maybe, but me? I play these things smart!

Gangster: He's outta here.

Gangster: You're an insult to the family!

[Tommy manages to hit Sam.]

Sam: Lucky shot, Tom... But the thing about drug money is it pays for a lot of muscle... Put him down, boys!

Gangster: Hey! HEY! Over here!

Gangster: Got ya!

Sam: You're tired of this life. Tom. I know that. I've seen it grow in you for years. But now there's only one way out. And I'm the guy that gets to give it to you. However far you run. Salieri will find you!

[Tommy finally manages to kill all the gangsters. Sam is bleeding to death and can no longer escape. Tommy approaches him.]

Tommy Angelo: Nobody's carrying you to the doctor this time, Sam.

Sam: You kill me now, and the Don? He's never gonna stop lookin' for you... But you let me live... I'll tell Salieri you're dead. You can disappear, just like Frank. Only you'll be smart enough to staw gone right?

Tommy Angelo: What happened to him?

Sam: He was hidin' out in Europe. But the dumb bastard started bettin’ at the dog track. He got spotted by a friend of the family. So, Salieri… sent out a crew…

Tommy Angelo: And his family?

[Sam shrugs.]

Tommy Angelo: Christ…

[He reloads his Browning and points it at Sam.]

Sam: You can't do it, can you? Always that little voice in the back of your head... Maybe sounds like your baby girl or Sarah. Always tellin' you not to pull that trigger... And you can't make up your mind...

Tommy Angelo: It's gettin' easier every time you open your fuckin' mouth.

Sam: Hah... We sure had some laughs, right? Remember that time me you, and Paulie --

[Tommy shots. And again, two more times. He throws his Browning on Sam’s breathless body and leaves. Blood dripping on the money downstairs. After that there is the meeting with Detective Norman. They continue their long conversation in the diner.]

Detective Norman: I sympathize with your situation, Tom. An' I want to help your family. But, I can't do anything unless you're willing to testify in court. You understand that? You'll have to sit in that box staring down Salieri, Ralphie, Vinny... Maybe even Sarah's father. I don't think you've got the stones for it if I'm bein' honest.

Tommy Angelo: I'll do what needs to be done. But you need to get my family new
identities, and ship them far away from here. 

Detective Norman: Whoa. Hold on. There's a long road between us sittin' here bumpin' gums and Sarah sleepin' under new stars.

Tommy Angelo: Then I'm sorry I wasted your time. And mine. I gotta get out of town.

Detective Norman: Look, Tom. I got a family too. Wife, four boys.

Tommy Angelo: All Irish twins?

Detective Norman: Yeah. So you know I understand what you're goin' through. All the worryin' over them. The fear that one of them's gonna go before you do... But this case, it'll be one of the biggest this city has ever seen. It could drag on for years, and I don’t know if I can protect you for that long. Not with the way things are downtown…

Tommy Angelo: Everyone's gotta eat, right? Even dirty cops.

Detective Norman: Just being honest, here. There's a few badges I can trust downtown, but not many. And if it comes down to you or me taking a bullet: I'm not gonna make my wife a widow. And keeping you alive ain't exactly the moral course. But I'll try.

Tommy Angelo: That's a pretty good sales job, trying to make me think you got nothing on the line. But this is your whole career, right here. However it works out for me, whether I live or die, you get to crack the Morello case and take down a Don. Salieri will be your legacy.

Detective Norman: Don't go thinking you know me, Tom. Salieri belongs behind bars. I help you so long as you help me put him there. That's all this is.

Tommy Angelo: Then that has to be enough.

Epilogue (1951)
[A fairly gray-haired Tommy walks his daughter down the isle.]

Tommy Angelo: A long time ago, in another life, someone once told me that family is a man's Achilles heel. His greatest weakness. And maybe he was right… Because everything I've done, both good and bad… I've done for my family. 

[Vincenzo and Ralphie are taken by the police…]

Tommy Angelo: I've turned my back on people I thought were my friends...

[Son Salieri is put in prison...]

Tommy Angelo: I've kept a lot of hard promises… 

[Tommy himself is also serving time…]

Tommy Angelo: I've spent eight years totally alone… Trying to find myself. So I could come home… A better husband… A better father… A better man. Now that I'm a lot older and just a bit wiser I see that family is our greatest weakness. But it is also our greatest strength. It gets us out of bed in the morning; it lets us chase our teams, even when the life moving too fast to catch; and it keeps us from falling over when we're too tired to take another step.

[Tommy is watering roses outside his house. A red car stops next to him and a young man gets out.]

Vito Scaletta: Mr. Angelo?

Tommy Angelo: Yes.

Vito Scaletta: Mr. Salieri sends his regards.

[Joe Barbaro, the second young man pulls out a double-barreled shotgun and fires a shot into Tommy's stomach. He falls to the grass, writhing in death agony. Sarah runs out.]

Sarah: Tommy!

Tommy Angelo: It's okay. You're safe now. 

[All his family gather around Tommy.]

Tommy Angelo: You're all safe… Remember that money, jobs, even best pals will come and go. But family? Family is forever.

THE END
