DOCTOR OCTOPUS IS PLOTTING THE CROWNING CAPER OF HIS CRIMINAL CAREER… TO RULE THE WORLD. HE HAS REUNITED THE SINISTER SIX AND WITH THESE SUPER-VILLAINS TOGETHER AGAIN, NOTHING STANDS IN THEIR WAY -- EXCEPT SPIDER-MAN!

ELECTRO TAKES CHARGE OF THE SITUATION…

[Spidey walks through New York City at night, battling criminals and descends into the sewers, which leads him to a power plant where he meets Electro. The villain flies across the room on a platform but Spidey easily defeats him.]

SANDMAN APPEARS WITH A FIST OF FURY…

[Spidey walks into an abandoned factory. The Sandman follows him on his heels, appearing here and there. Spidey descends into the dark, sandy caves, where he engages in a final battle with the shapeless villain and, after a tense brawl, is victorious.]

SPIDER-MAN HUNTS FOR MYSTERIO... THE MASTER OF ILLUSION.

[Spidey follows Mysterio to the high-tech factory. After defeating the illusory bandits, Spidey finds where Mysterio is hiding. Defeating him wasn't too difficult, because without his tricks Mysterio is just a weakling.]

VULTURE SWOOPS FOR SPIDER-MAN…

[Spidey is running around town from a huge flying bird. However, it's not really a bird... It's the Vulture, Spider-Man's sworn enemy. Spidey fights the Vulture on the roof of a skyscraper and wins.]

ONCE HE WAS HUMAN... ...NOW HE'S HOBGOBLIN

[Hobgoblin lures Spider-Man into the woods. A brief fight leads them both to the caves, where Spidey defeats the mad Hobgoblin on a flying board.]

MASTERMINDING THE MAYHEM... ...DR. OCTOPUS IS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE.

[On his way out of the forest, Spidey finds an ancient castle (though perhaps it's just a setting for a medieval fair) where he has to face off against the leader of the Sinister Six - Dr. Octopus. The Doctor is as strong and agile as ever. His fast metal tentacles easily block Spidey's attacks and he has to calculate the moment to strike. The battle proves to be the tensest of the previous ones, but our friendly neighbor Spider-Man wins!]

VICTORY! SPIDER-MAN TRIUMPHS OVER THE SINISTER SIX…

[The villains go to jail where they belong!]

THE END
