Dedicated to a big fan of the game, Timofey Guselnikov.

[Adam reflects on the past events.]

Adam Jensen: The year was 2027. Advances in biotechnology were helping people improve their physical and mental abilities to an amazing degree--provided, of course, they had enough money. A new breed of people was emerging, half-human, half-machine. And in Detroit at least, not everyone was happy to see it. I’d just landed a job as Head of Security at Sarif industries, a cutting edge biotech firm. David Sarif himself handpicked me for the job, said he needed me to keep his people safe. My ex, Megan Reed, was one of them. A brilliant neuroscientist, Megan had found a way to make augmentations safe and affordable for everyone. All she had to do was present her research to Congress--but the night before her big meeting, my security measures failed. A team of black op mercenaries stormed into Sarif Headquarters, massacring everyone in sight. Three of the mercs were heavily augmented walking tanks. Their mission? Take out Megan and her team. I tried to stop them but their leader tossed me through a plate glass wall. Last thing I heard as his bullet slammed into my brain was Megan’s dying scream. I should have died with her. Only I didn’t. High-end, military-grade “enhancements” saved my life--the best augmentations Sarif’s money could buy. Took me half a year to get a feel for ’em. Should’ve taken longer, but six months to my recovery Sarif Industries was attacked again. This time, by a radical group of pro-human “purists.” Violent. Militant. And fanatically opposed to human augmentation, they claimed to be members of the Humanity Front, a non-profit organization that wanted the U-N to limit biotechnology research. The thugs broke into Sarif’s factory and found machinists working overtime on a top secret military augment called the Typhoon. Sarif sent me to retrieve it and when I did, found one of the so-called pur sis next to it. Wired with cerebral implants, trying to download is class med specs. Obviously something more was going on. The Aug killed himself before I could question him. Sarif ordered me to dig deeper, so with the help of Frank Pritchard, Sarif’s Head of Cyber security. I did. Turns out, a second hacker had been controlling the Aug’s actions from somewhere offsite. Pritchard and I tracked his signal to a secret FEMA internment camp in Detroit. The black op mercenaries were there--the same mercs who’s left me for dead six months before. Figured they’d try again when they saw me. Wasn’t so easy for ’em this time. I took out the tank named Barrett and even got him to give me a new lead-a penthouse apartment in China. Of course, we both knew it would be a trap in the end... Hengsha Island, China. Home to a city so crowded, they had to build a second city on top of it. Trying to find clues in Hengsha wouldn’t be easy. Lucky for me, I wasn’t alone. Faridah Malik, Sarif Industries’ ace pilot, had lived in Hengsha before. A good person to have on your side. She knew enough about the place to get me around. Malik dropped merche lower city close to the penthouse Barrett had told me about. Belltower Associates, a private Security firm under contract to the Chinese government, had agerts tossing the suite when I arrived. Just not for the reason I’d been expecting. Turns out the man who lived there was a criminal hacker named van Bruggen--some hacker who’d been remotely controlling the Aug in Sarif’s factory. Van Bruggen panicked decision to force them to commit suicide had been a mistake. Now his mercenary partners were gunning for him, and I needed to find him before they did. Locating van Bruggen meant playing nice with the Triads, Hengsha’s organized crime lords. They had the hacker holed up inside a low-rent capsule hotel. By the time I found him, van Bruggen had no qualms giving up the woman who’d hired him: Zhao Yun Ru, president of the Tai Yong Medical Corporation. According van Bruggen, Zhao wanted to monopolize the augmentation industry, and had hired black op mercenaries to destabilize her competition. Sarif Industries was at the top of her list. To prove this, I needed to get inside T-Y-M grab a surveillance hologram off a server. I suspected van Bruggen was hiding something when he told me this, but nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. Megan wasn’t dead. She and her four best researchers had been kidnapped--spirited away somewhere while their kidnappers made it look like they were dead! Desperate to learn more. I confronted Zhao in her penthouse. She claimed to be a pawn in a bigger plan and hinted at a group so powerful, it controlled global interests at a whim. Then she slipped into a panic room and hit the alarm. Forcing me to make a very quick exit... I figured Zhao was lying, but part of her confession made sense, David Sarif had been worried about his people. So worried, he’d required all of them to have sub dermal locator devices surgically implanted. The G-P-Ls would have been broadcasting the day of the attack. But Zhao said a single call to Picus, the world’s leader in global, 24-hour satellite news--had turned those signals off. I needed to fly to Picus headquarters in Montreal if I wanted to learn more... Eliza Cassan. Picus Communications “First Lady of News”... Malik thought I was reaching when I told her Eliza was involved in this. The world’s most famous news anchor working with a mercenary hit squad? But when I confronted Cassan in her office, she freely admitted to jamming Detroit’s satellites the night Megan’s team had been taken. Said she’d just been following her commands. I suspected she wanted to say more, but black op mercenaries showed up, looking to shut us both down. And just like that, the Eliza I’d been talking to disappeared. The mercs were led by an augmented killer I’d crossed paths with twice before--Fedorova. A woman who’d made silence her best friend. She waited for me to track Eliza’s transmission to a secret server room underneath the Picus complex, then jumped me from behind. A deadly fight ensued. I made sure she never moved silently again. With Fedorova down and no one left to keep her quiet, Eliza reappeared. Turns out, Picus “First Lady or News" wasn’t a lady at all. She was a sophisticated A-I program, engineered to monitor data streams and control what people believed. Eliza told me the mercs had brought in a Humanity Front doctor famed Isaias Sandoval to remove the scientists’ implanted tracking devices while Detroit’s satellites were down. She also told me to speak to David Sarif if I wanted to learn more. By the time Malik and I got back to Detroit, tensions between normal and augmented citizens had reached a nashpoint. Riots were breaking out in severe cities, and the UN was being urged to intervene, Sarif was trying hard to convince Hugh Darrow, the inventor-turned philanthrop who’d once been a leading proponent of enhancement technologies, to help stop a possible regulatory vote. Sarif had a lot riding on Darrow, Megan’s discovery would have given millions of people the chance to evolve beyond their normal human abilities, and at the same time, catapulted Sarif Industries to the top of the Fortune 500. According to Sarif, Megan’s kidnappers knew this, and didn’t want people evolving unless they controlled how it was done. He called his enemies “Illuminati” and urged me to keep searching. Determined to do so, I tracked down Sandoval via America’s most outspoken augmentation opponent. Bill Taggart--Sandoval’s boss and founder of The Humanity Front. Sandoval admitted to operating on Megan’s team when I confronted him, but said he hadn’t removed their G-P-Ls. He’d merely switched them to a different frequency. Pritchard was able to trace one of the signals to China. Malik and I immediately took off in pursuit. Unfortunately, the Illuminati were one step ahead… Ambushed. Shot out of the sky by Belltower Associates seconds after entering Hengsha’s airspace. Malik’s piloting skills saved me. After a tense and bitter struggle, I escaped into Lower Hengsha. The tracking signal I was following led straight to the Triads. Or more specifically to the augmented arm of Tong Si Hung, leader of a gang of augmentation Harvesters. Tong said they’d taken the aim off a corpse which Belltower had left at their door. Meaning, at least one of Sarif’s scientists was dead. Maybe not the rest of them, though. Tong pointed me to a port used for human trafficking and helped me slip aboard a Belltower ship. It was sailing to Rifleman Bank Station, a military base in the South China Sea. Belltower was holding kidnapped civilians as prisoners there, and using them to perfect The Hyron Project--a human-computer interface that left most of its test subjects dead. My search for Megan would’ve ended then, if not for a mysteriously named Quinn. In exchange for my help exposing Belltower, he slipped me aboard a second ship headed to Singapore, and an Illuminati-run biotech facility called Omega Ranch. Three of Sarif’s scientists were there forced by their captors to create a technology capable of remotely shutting down augmented abilities. Thanks to an emergency recall notice issued by the World Health Organization millions of people all over the world already had the biochip installed. With the help of the scientists, I tracked Megan to a private section of the Ranch. There, I ran into Jaron Namir, the walking lank who’d put a bullet in my brain the first time we’d met. He’d teamed up with Zhao, and was hoping to catch me off guard. Their little ambush can’t work. I found Megan in a suite belonging to Hugh Darrow, the billionaire philanthropist whom Sarif had called or for help. Darrow had convinced her to go along with the biochip plan by promising to sabotage the tech. As she was explaining this. Darrow appeared in a global broadcast telling the world that augmentations would be the death of mankind. Then he activated the biochips to prove his point. All over the world,
 augmented people flew into a killing frenzy. Darrow had betrayed everyone--and it was up to me to set things right. To do it, I had to reach Panchoea, a massive installation in the Arctic Ocean. As raced through corridors built by an all-augmented workforce. I saw death and destruction firsthand. By the time I shut down Darrow’s broadcast, I knew the damage he’d done. Yet humanity’s future remained unclear. How would the world react to this sabotage? Would people ever regain their faith in augmentation again? What would be the Illuminati’s next move? Only time could give us the answers…

SQUAREENIX & EIDOS MONTREAL
presents

[A helicopter flies over the endless sea. The camera pans up and we get a view of the ruined city.]

Adam Jensen: I once thought I could save the world. Now look at it.

OPERATION BLADEDANCER
[Bandits are rampaging all over the city. Houses are on fire. The common people suffer from hunger, wounds, and the grief of loss. The unflinching Eliza Cassan tells people about the events in the news. Adam meanwhile is in the helicopter with a squad of soldiers. He checks his augmented arm.]

Adam Jensen: (thoughts) Sometimes you just have to let go... and embrace what you’ve become.

Duncan MacReady: Not gonna go all wonky on us now, hanzer. Are ya?

Adam Jensen: Well, if I do, MacReady... (pokes his armor with a blade) I guarantee you’ll never see it coming.

Director James Miller: Agent Jensen! Am I gonna have a problem with you?

Adam Jensen: No, sir. No reason to assume you would.

Director James Miller: Good. Because you are the only augmented operative on this team, and I intend to make good use of you. Listen up, all of you! We’ve got a sandstorm barreling down our ass and we can’t afford to make mistakes! Were going after this man--an arms dealer named “Sheppard.” He’s ex-Belltower. One of the Special Forces commanders who disappeared during the incident.

Duncan MacReady: And he’s come out of hiding? That cannot be good.

Director James Miller: It’s not. He’s selling weapons and military grade augments to terrorists. This is Arun Singh the undercover agent who lured Sheppard out omis hole. Best U.C. Interpol’s got. For three years he’s worked hard to get in tight with the Jinn--an Iraqi smuggling cartel that’s infected the Eastern Hemisphere like a plague. Last week, our arms dealer sent a message to the Jinn, offering to sell them a shiit-load of black-market merchandise dirt cheap. They told Singh to handle the buy.

Adam Jensen: They’re not gonna like it when Interpol disrupts their party. Is Singh’s cover really that good?

Director James Miller: It is right now. We need to keep it that way. This is where the deal’s going down -- a hall finished high rise hotel that’s been abandoned ever since the incident. It is not a pretty picture inside.

Duncan MacReady: Let me guess. Most of the laborers were augmented with heavy duty industrial risks. So when the incident hit and they all went schizo… (looks at Adam)

Director James Miller: ...things got gruesome real fast. And no one except for some homeless junkies have been inside the place ever since.

Duncan MacReady: So what’s your plan, Director?

Director James Miller: Singh’s meeting Sheppard on the ground floor, inside the hotel’s main atrium. He’s sent the bulk of his Jinn crew to the penthouse levels to secure a vantage point. I want MacReady’s team to take up positions overlooking the atrium and make the arrest. Jensen, you’re going in solo from the roof.

Adam Jensen: My objectives?

Director James Miller: Keep the Jinn from joining the party. As far as we can tell, only one route connects the atrium to the penthouse level--a halfway decent elevator shaft here. I want you to block access to it.

Adam Jensen: Fine. Just cut me loose.

Director James Miller: Do you plan on relying solely on your augments for this one? I’d recommend taking a little hardware, just to be sure.

[He gives Adam a choice between lethal and non-lethal weapon.]

Adam Jensen: (choosing a non-lethal in his thoughts) We’ve got a U.C. in there. Might be easier to maintain his cover if he’s not the only one still breathing when this is done.

Adam Jensen: (choosing a lethal weapon in his thoughts) I’m not leaving my six exposed. Give me something lethal.

[Finally he chooses non-lethal weapon.]

Adam Jensen: We’ve got a U.C. in there. Might be easier to maintain his cover if he’s not the only one still breathing when this is done.

Director James Miller: Smart thinking.

Duncan MacReady: Yeah, but if anything does happen to him, you’ll be telling his wife. After you get out of the hospital, of course.

Director James Miller: What about range? There’s lots of wide spaces and high ceilings in there, but a number of tight and constrained rooms, too.

Duncan MacReady: So it’s a crap shoot, really.

[Adam chooses between a distance weapon (tranquilizer rifle) and a short range weapon (stun gun).]

Adam Jensen: (choosing a stun gun) Never was one to play the odds. Give me something I can use up close.

Director James Miller: You got it. One last thing, Jensen. Singh said the Jinn are using some sort of portable wifi-device to boost communications. He’s got a better chance of maintaining cover if you disable it.

Adam Jensen: I’ll keep an eye out for it. But aren’t we on the clock here? You said there’s a sandstorm moving in.

Director James Miller: There is. And we got the Intel on this mission at the very last minute. So we’re scrambling a little. If it comes to it, your Number One priority is keeping the Jinn out of that atrium.

Adam Jensen: Copy that.

Loudspeaker: Time to put away your happy thoughts, gentlemen. We’re approaching the target building.

Director James Miller: You’re up first, Jensen. Let’s do this.

دبيّ (DUBAI) - 2029

Radio: Task Force Actual. This is Knife Leader. Engage hush-drives and descend to angels one-five.

[Planes are approaching the hotel. Adam gets up from his seat and epically, without a parachute, jumps out of the cargo hatch. He lands with an anti-grav. Adam is surrounded by ruins and corpses.]

Adam Jensen: Team leader, this is Jensen. I’m on the roof.

Director James Miller: Solid copy. Move into the building. The access route you need to block is at the far end of the penthouses. And keep in mind, the direct route might not be the easiest one.

Adam Jensen: Roger that.

Director James Miller: MacReady will advise once his team is on the ground. Miller out.

[Adam is moving toward his position.]

Duncan MacReady: Jensen, we’re moving through--Aw, fuck!

Adam Jensen: What’s wrong?

Duncan MacReady: The Jinn have got a few gennys up and running. Gonna have to hack keypads.

Adam Jensen: You should enjoy it, MacReady. They have colors and shapes. Just remember red means bad.

[Adam stuns several opponents and decides to check on Duncan.]

Adam Jensen: MacReady, how you making out?

Duncan MacReady: Slower than expected. It’s like someone’s tilled a fucking cemetery down here.

Adam Jensen: Say again?

Duncan MacReady: When the shit hit the fan in twenty-seven, the rush must have been for the stairs. There’s corpses everywhere. A lot of your cousins are here too, Jensen. You want me to grab you any spare parts?

Adam Jensen: No parts, but I take mine with cream and two sugars while you’re asking.

[He continues on to the rooftops.]

Director James Miller: Jensen, what’s your twenty?

Adam Jensen: Working my way through the penthouses.

Director James Miller: Remember to keep an eye out for the Jinn’s communications booster if you can’t disable it.

Adam Jensen: Roger that.

Director James Miller: Listen up, everyone. Chang’s hacked into the Jinn’s radio signal, checking the patch now. We should be hearing Singh any second....

Arun Singh: (via radio in Arabic) [The seller will be here soon, Khalil. Go and tell the others to move into the atrium now. I will meet you there.]

Adam Jensen: Patch is clean.

Duncan MacReady: Solid copy.

Director James Miller: Good. I’ll re-patch us once the deal kicks off.

Duncan MacReady: Jensen, we’re inside the atrium, taking up positions on the terraces. What’s your twenty?

Adam Jensen: Still moving.

Duncan MacReady: Well hurry the fuck up. Enemy helos inbound and this sun stones getting close. You get that comm boosters desabled?

Adam Jensen: Negative. Didn’t find it.

Duncan MacReady: Well, you better hope Singh’s cover stays intact. Otherwise, you’ll be answering to me.

[Adam enters the once luxurious room and immediately rips out a panel on the wall with his bare hands.]

Adam Jensen: This is Jensen. Penthouse access route secure. Jinn shouldn’t be a problem. Over.

Soldier: (via radio) Copy that.

Duncan MacReady: (via radio) About fucking time. Enemy helo sighted.

[A helicopter flies in the half destroyed hotel.]

Duncan MacReady: (via radio) Alright, strike force. Position and hold.

Soldier: (via radio) Strike One, in position.

Soldier 2: (via radio) Strike Two, all set.

Soldier 3: (via radio) Strike Three. Yeah.

Soldier 4: (via radio) Strike Four in position and holding, boss. Eyes up, safeties off, guys.

Soldier 3: (via radio) Yeah no shit, brown-nose.

Soldier 4: (via radio) Watch your fucking mouth, Halliday.

Soldier 5: (via radio) Both of you shut up. Five, in position.

Duncan MacReady: (via radio) Everybody stay sharp. Singh’s got eyes on Sheppard. Patching you in now. Target’s in the A.O. Remember Singh’s down there, so watch your fire.

[Several men come out of the helicopter and bring out a large box. Singh approaches them.]

Man: You got balls, Singh. Executing a buy with a sandstorm on our ass?

Arun Singh: I cannot take credit for Mother Nature, Mr...?

Man: You can call me Sheppard.

Arun Singh: How biblical. Are these the weapons?

Sheppard: The augs. They’re getting harder to come by. Guns are still on the chopper. Show me the cash quick and we’ll--

[Suddenly, someone in a gold mask appears behind him and snaps Sheppard’s neck.]

Arun Singh: What the!!!

[Other masked men kill the rest of his team. Arun runs for cover.]

Arun Singh: (into the microphone) The party’s been crashed! Sheppard is dead!

Man: (via radio) What?! By who?! What’s going on down there?

Adam Jensen: Miller, this isn’t the Jinn! Repeat! It’s not the Jinn!

[The golden mask men kill Arun’s crew with SMG.]

Arun Singh: (into the microphone) They’re after the weapons! Open fire, OPEN FIRE!

[MacReady’s soldiers open fire, too.]

Adam Jensen: MacReady. They’re making a grab for the chopper! You got a shot?

Duncan MacReady: (via radio) Negative! Negative! We’re under heavy fire down here! We can’t let that chopper take off, Jensen.

Adam Jensen: (sighs) I got it.

Black Market Buy
Arun Singh: (via radio, screaming) This is bad! They’re closing in!

Duncan MacReady: (via radio) We’re gonna lose Singh! Jensen, I can’t reach him!

[Adam epically jumps off the top floors onto the helicopter pad. A sandstorm rises.]

Director James Miller: (via radio) Jensen, this sandstorm might have just bought US some time, but you need to disable that chopper!

Adam Jensen: Copy that!

[He begins to eliminate the golden mask men hiding in the sandstorm.]

Duncan MacReady: (via radio) Man down! Man down!

Director James Miller: (via radio) Who’s hit?! Jensen, strike team, sound off!

Duncan MacReady: (via radio) It’s Singh! Repeat. Singh is dead! Ah good fucking job, Jensen, you fucking bell end.

[Adam sneaks over to the helicopter and takes the battery out of it.]

Adam Jensen: Miller. Chopper’s been grounded. Repeat—

Director James Miller: Jensen! (he kills the last golden mask man) You’re welcome.

Adam Jensen: Shit!

[The building is beginning to fall apart. Now there is nothing to hold back the sandstorm. Adam feels the fury of nature on him and screams. What happens next is like the delirium of a dying brain. Adam’s “wings” are being scalded. She falls into the water and begins to sink. Against this background, we hear the voices of newscasters mixed with his own memories.]

...artificial eves to prosthetic limbs...

...from molecular-sized computers…

...human-controlled evolution available to all.

We will merge with machines, with computers...

When this is done, the Illuminati won’t be able to control men and women like you as they had planned.

No, stop!

Scenes of horror on the streets of Detroit--

...kind of madness has gripped mechanically-augmented people.

Shanghai, Los Angeles, Ankara, Dubai--

People are dying out there! Millions of people!

The search for Survivors in Parchaea has been downgraded to a recovery mission.

The Czech Republic leads a growing list of countries calling for the relocation of its augmented citizens...

It’s a new world, Adam. It’s afraid of people like us.

...bussed into safe, and secure, segregated districts.

Sarif Industries closed its doors today…

You didn’t think it would end with the Aug incident, did you?

We were victims! This is retribution for a tragedy we could not control!

They control the news. They buried the truth with disinformation.

Multiple detonations, looks like car bombs.

Another terrorist attack, this time in a police station.

...the United Nations Security Council tasked Interpol…

...the new anti-terrorist intelligence and response team will have global jurisdiction...

...Task Force 29...

Agent Jensen.

I won’t let it happen again.

DEUS EX MANKIND DIVIDED

[We get to a meeting of some powerful people.]

Lucius DeBeers: What have the events in Dubai cost us?

Morgan Everett: They knew the risks....

Lucius DeBeers: How many assets did we lose?

Morgan Everett: All of them. The sandstorm didn’t help...

Bob Page: The mission was a success.

Volkard Rand: Clearly, your scale for success is a generous one. However, the erratic nature of the attack could work to our advantage. Interpol will be confused for weeks, and with our continued guidance, the people will come around eventually. We are all in this for the long game, after all.

Morgan Everett: That’s never changed.

Lucius DeBeers: You think so? Do I need to remind you all how far we have veered off course? The Aug Incident has caused a schism in society. Things are worse than we projected, and growing more unstable every day. This will not be tolerated! To ensure the success of our vision, the disruptive elements must be excised.

Volkard Rand: No one here disagrees with you. But let me fly to New York and I will personally evaluate the situation. We may already have the votes we need to ensure that the Human Restoration Act passes.

Lucius DeBeers: Very well. Stanton, you accompany him. We may need to exert financial as well as political pressure to silence anyone opposed. Proceed.

[Volkard Rand and Stanton Dowd’s holograms disappear.]

Lucius DeBeers: Elizabeth, I’ll contact you later.

[Elizabeth DuClare hologram disappears.]

Morgan Everett: It won’t succeed, Lucius. Even with Dowd’s money. You know what Rand will find in New York? Weak, ineffectual men. And with Nathaniel Brown still an unknown factor--

Lucius DeBeers: Of course, that is why we’re proceeding with our alternate strategy. You have claimed much in the past, Page. This is your chance to deliver.

Bob Page: Everything is in place. We can initiate whenever you wish.

Morgan Everett: How secure are your communications, Bob? "Janus" seems to have eyes everywhere these days. He and his Juggernaut Collective--

Lucius DeBeers: Janus won’t be an issue. I’ve made arrangements. Dubai laid the foundations. Now it is time to get everyone’s attention... Page, activate the sleeper cell.

[Those left in the room also dissolve into thin air - they, too, were holograms. The camera zooms out and through the triangular window to give us a light hint of the Illuminati. Adam, meanwhile, wakes up on the train.]

Announcer: (in Czech) [Last stop, Růžička Station, coming up in five!]

PRAHA - ONE WEEK LATER

Adam Jensen: (via radio) Miller. It’s Jensen. Just getting off the train now.

Director James Miller: (via radio) Copy that. We’ll debrief when you get in. You coming straight to the office?

Adam Jensen: Unless there’s a problem at a checkpoint.

Director James Miller: (via radio) Your papers should be in order... just keep your lead down. Miller out.

[Adam exits the train and puts his signature sunglasses on.]

Adam Jensen: HUD off.

[Adam notices a man with a suitcase bumping into his contact, Alex Vega.]

Alejandra Vega: Oh! So sorry! Sorry. Damn it...

Man: Huh! Oh excuse me, I’m very sorry, I-- (notices augmentations) Oh, Kurva! You damn clank! Why don’t you watch where you’re going?

Adam Jensen: Here. Let me help you with that, ma’am.

Alejandra Vega: “Ma’am?” Seriously?

Adam Jensen: I could’ve gone with "Sweetie." You get my message about Dubai?

Yeah. I’m glad you’re alright, Adam. That ambush sounded pretty bad, man.

Adam Jensen: Not something I was expecting, that’s for sure. Any idea who hit us?

Alejandra Vega: Well, I’m sure your Task Force will come up with something. And that it won’t be what the Juggernaut Collective digs up. Kinda odd though, don’t you think-- Interpol sending your team, the Prague team, to Dubai in the first place?

Adam Jensen: Miller said they were scrambling. Last minute intel. We were the only strike team available.

Alejandra Vega: Yeah, well, that’s a lie. (notices a security) Better get moving.

[They casually walk down the street.]

Alejandra Vega: The Collective has been keeping tabs on all Task Force divisions ever since we slipped you into one of them. They’ve got a team in Oman, could’ve been there a hell of lot faster than you guys.

Adam Jensen: So why send us?

Alejandra Vega: Don’t know. If the Task Force is an Illuminati front, like we all suspect, doesn’t make much sense to send it into an ambush.

Adam Jensen: Unless they wanted our team to see something... officially?

Soldier: (approaching, in Czech) [What’s the problem?] (in fact, he said, "Let me see your papers," which Alex does.)

Soldier: (in Czech) [Your papers are ready for inspection.]

Alejandra Vega: Don’t make a scene, Adam.

Adam Jensen: Wouldn’t dream of it, Alex.

[The soldier checks Adam’s papers.]

Soldier: (in Czech) [Keep moving.]

Alejandra Vega: I swear it’s gotten even worse here in the past few days. Everyone looking over their shoulder terrified Augs like us are going to attack them again.

Adam Jensen: Somebody probably will. Treat people like animals long enough, they’ll start acting like animals.

Alejandra Vega: You say that like there’s nothing we can do to stop it.

Adam Jensen: I already tried, two years ago. Didn’t work out so well.

Alejandra Vega: So what? Are you saying we should just give up? Let hatred and prejudice take over? To hell with that.

Adam Jensen: I’m saying I can only go after enemies I see, Alex. The men who caused all this, the true power-brokers-- they’re the ones I need to stop. I thought you knew that.

Alejandra Vega: I do. You, me, the Juggernaut Collective-- we’re all trying to stop them. It doesn’t mean turning a blind eye to--

Adam Jensen: Then help me find them.

[They go into the train station.]

Soldier 2: Hold it! Hand over your papers. (police drone scans Adam) Just watch yourself, Clank.

Alejandra Vega: I hate this city! Come on. If you’re right about Dubai-- about the Illuminati needing your team as witnesses then we need to find out why. Who gave you the order to mobilize?

Adam Jensen: Miller did. But it probably came from someone higher up the chain.

Alejandra Vega: Doesn’t mean he’s not in on it. Ever heard of the NSN?

Adam Jensen: The Neural SubNet, sure. In TF29, directors use it to plan ops and communicate privately in cyberspace. What’s this?

Alejandra Vega: Whisper-chip. Custom-made wire-tap device. Janus designed it to fit inside the NSN’s motherboard.

Adam Jensen: Ahh, the elusive Janus, leader of the hacktivists... Am lever gonna meet this guy?

Alejandra Vega: Someday, maybe. Right now, you need to concentrate on Miller, and find a way to access the NSN’s motherb--

[A couple of pops scare the public in the station. A massive explosion happens near the front door.]

Adam Jensen: Alex? You okay?

Alejandra Vega: Yeah. Yeah...

Adam Jensen: Let’s get outta here.

Child: Mom, Mom? Mom, mom where are you?

Adam Jensen: D’you hear that?

Child: Mom! Somebody help me!

Adam Jensen: I’m gonna check it out.

Alejandra Vega: Ok, be careful. We’ll talk.

Child: Mom! Please! Please, please can you help? ...Momma. Please. Can you help her? Mem, Mom.

[Adam finds the boy trying in vain to get his mother out of the rubble.]

Adam Jensen: Here, stand back. Let me help.

[With his augmented arms Adam lifts the concrete slab under which the child’s mother is located. But… she’s dead.]

Child: Mom, wake up. Mom... Mom you gotta wake up. Mom, please! ...Wake up. Wake up, mom.

[Adam puts his glasses on to cover the tears.]

PRAHA - 30 HOURS AFTER THE TRAIN STATION BOMBING

[Adam is lying in bed in a hotel room. He wakes up.]

Adam Jensen: HUD on.

[A check of all systems shows a large number of malfunctions in Adam’s mechanical parts.]

Adam Jensen: Shit. Alex... it’s Adam.

Alejandra Vega: Hey. You sound like shit. How you feeling?

Adam Jensen: A little sore, but... I’ll be alright. Are you okay?

Alejandra Vega: Uh… yeah, yeah I’m okay. I’ve been through worse. Jesus, how fucked up that to think, huh?

Adam Jensen: Listen, Alex, my systems are acting up a little, so I’ve got to get checked out, but… if you want to meet or--

Alejandra Vega: What? No. No, no, I’m fine, man. You just take care of you. This girl’s built tough. Gimme a call when you’re useful again, okay?

Adam Jensen: Alright I will. Talk to you soon.

Morning Comes Too Soon
[Adam gets out of bed.]

Computer: Good morning, Adam. You have one new message. 

Adam Jensen: From? 

Computer: David Sarif. 

Adam Jensen: (sighs) Play it. 

David Sarif: (on record) Adam! It's David. I know it's been a while, but after what happened in Prague yesterday... Look, son, whatever reasons you've had for not getting in touch these last two years, well-- life's too short. I'm leaving for London soon, but... give me a call. 

Adam Jensen: You saved his vid-call number? 

Computer: Yes, Adam. Just activate your TV system. 

[Adam gets dressed and prepares to leave the apartment. He calls Miller.]

Adam Jensen: Miller, it's Jensen.

Director James Miller: It's good to finally hear from you, agent You doing okay?

Adam Jensen: Sorry about the downtime. I'll get to the office as soon as I can but my augs took a hit during the attack. I need to get them looked at.

Director James Miller: Of course. There's a lot of work ahead of us, Jensen. I see you when you get in.

[Adam hangs up and calls his doctor.]

Adam Jensen: Doctor Koller, I need to pay you a visit. 

Václav Koller: Jensen! Now's actually a really good time for me. Like right now.

Adam Jensen: Something wrong? 

Václav Koller: There are some guys in my bookshop. Pissed off Dvali gangster looking guys. So... unless you want bloodshed the day AFTER a terror attack...

Adam Jensen: The front door isn't the most peaceful option. I got it. 

[Adam walks into the next apartment and sees a cultist praying over the body of some poor guy lying unconscious.]

Cultist: Seeker... You are here to see the Builder? He has been asleep but I cannot wake him... I do not know if he will recover. 

[Adam goes down to the streets of Prague. The local police are detaining suspicious individuals. The exit from the courtyard is blocked. Adam approaches the guard at the gate.]

Guard: Street is off limits, uyobok (fucker)! Private function. All businesses are… temporarily closed. 

[Adam approaches the other guard behind the laser gate.]

Guard 2: Doklady... Doklady! (Papers... papers!) Show me latest papers. Otherwise you cannot go through here. 

Adam Jensen: I know the drill.

Guard 2: The drill has changed. Too many forgeries. All Augs must now carry a supplementary permit authentication card. Do you have this card? 

Adam Jensen: My documentation's never been a problem before. It's not about to become one now.

Guard 2: You are sure about this? I am police man. You see uniform? You see gun? 

Adam Jensen: Now that you mention it, your setup looks a little odd. Budget cuts? 

Guard 2: No need to insult us. Times are difficult for regional document checking police. But fact remains, if you continue this way without newest permit, I am legally obliged to shoot you.

Adam Jensen: Is that right? 

Guard 2: My friend, I know what you're thinking... It's terrible the way they make laws against your kind. But listen, maybe I can do something to help… We could come to an understanding.

Adam Jensen: What kind of understanding?

Guard 2: Lucky for you, I know a guy. An expert in... permitification. A document agent. He offers permits, authentication cards, peace of mind. With his help, you go wherever you want, whenever you want, no more hassles. What do you say?

Adam Jensen: Supposing I wanted to pass through here right now. Before getting this special document of yours. Any way for me to do that?

Guard 2: Sure. I suggest our pay-and-go plan. It consists of you paying me and then me letting you go.

Adam Jensen: You mean bribery?

Guard 2: Wink wink, my friend. I prefer the term "standard fine." Tell you what, I'll even give you the good citizen discount. Just this once.

Adam Jensen: This document agent you mentioned - is he the one in charge? He gets you to stop Augs and offer them this... opportunity to do business with him?

Guard 2: Go see for yourself. My friend has documents to pass checkpoints, to keep police off your back. To get into parts of Prague you never knew existed. Tell him Drahomír sent you. You'll see. I give you address, yes?

Adam Jensen: Alright, give me the address. I think I'd like to see who's behind all this.

Drahomír Koníčky: Prekážka (Objection). There is a courtyard behind the apartment building. Very easy to find. My friend will be there. He will get you latest permit card. Just pay him and don't ask questions.

[Adam looks around for a document forger.]

Woman Police Officer: What do you want, clank? Go on back to your hole before I ship you off to Golem.

Guard 3: This area's restricted to you, Aug.

[He soon finds him.]

Adam Jensen: I was stopped by someone named Drahomír at a checkpoint. He sent me here. Apparently you help Augs with documentation. Upgrade their permits.

Forger: You have the money?

Adam Jensen: Maybe. Want to tell me what I’m paying for exactly?

Forger: You pay to get your name on the list. Milena upstairs, she works on your shiny new permit. You come back in one week to pick it up. Standard pick-up fee will apply.

Adam Jensen: How much do you charge people for this?

Forger: Not people. Augs. Thirty-five thousand credits.

Adam Jensen: You're not even trying, are you? You just blatantly scam Augs out of as much as you can.

Forger: You want updated permit or not? Documents are actually pretty good, you'll see. Trust me. The girl is very talented.

Adam Jensen: These documents, what are they? Stolen? Forged? Invisible?

Forger: Look, just give me what you have, and I'll put your name on the list. That's how it works. Milena does surprisingly good work. Puts more effort in than we ask her to.

Adam Jensen: I think I've heard all I need to about your... offer. And about your friend upstairs. I'm going to try my chances without the papers for now.

Forger: Suit yourself. Only a matter of time before they come knocking at night.

[Adam uses his skills and sneaks into the guard post, where he hacks into Dragomir's computer. He disables the cameras and opens the doors. Adam finds the same girl who forges the documents.]

Milena Epstein: I hope you're not Edward Brod. Because you don't look at all like the picture.

Adam Jensen: Want to tell me what's going on here?

Milena Epstein: Arts & Crafts?

Adam Jensen: I think you work for those scam artists out there. Or do they work for you.

Milena Epstein: It was never meant to be a scam. More like... um, social services for the disaffected. You know, no Aug left behind.

Adam Jensen: Looks like a forgery ring to me.

Milena Epstein: I hate the word forgery. I prefer graphic arts activism. I help people to... to be other people. And seriously, try getting anywhere with forgery on your resume.

Adam Jensen: You're involved in something that takes advantage of people. And you're worried about your resume?

Milena Epstein: That may have come out wrong. I mean, yes, career is important, but it's not everything, I know that. I tend to get nervous when I'm stress--I mean I stress when... Which always just makes things worse. OK, look, I have no reason to be nervous here, do I? You're totally on my side, right? One of the good guys! Not like Drahomír...

Adam Jensen: Your friends are out there intimidating Augs. Preying on their fears of getting deported. And it seems like you're part of that. You'll be lucky not to go to jail.

Milena Epstein: I'm already in jail. You think they let me leave this place? Drahomír tells people he is a cop, but he's not a cop. He's a bum who stole a uniform. And a gun. Which he points at people like me to make us do whatever he wants. What was supposed to do? I sit here and make the best documents can.

Adam Jensen: You were helping those thugs to extort people. That doesn't get much sympathy with me.

Milena Epstein: The extortion part sucks. I swear to you, I'm totally anti-extortion.

Adam Jensen: Obviously.

Milena Epstein: Let me explain better. The government, they print up these “official permits” each month. But they only sell them to their rich corporate and military alles. Meanwhile, the other Augs-they get cattled out of the city because their documents aren't 'up-to-date' enough. That's what was happening to my friends.

Adam Jensen: Government corruption versus organized crime. And regular people get caught in the middle. You gotta love the classics.

Milena Epstein: When it was just me, I didn't charge anyone. But then Drahomír shows up and turns it into this big operation with fake checkpoints and ridiculous fees. I didn't want anything to do with that, I wanted to stop.

Adam Jensen: Why didn't you?

Milena Epstein: I was scared. Drahomír said he would kill me. Looked at me kind of like you're looking at me now. You're not going to kill me, are you?

Adam Jensen: What do you think?

Milena Epstein: I'm not sure yet. Look, the real problem is Drahomír and that "checkpoint" of his. Without him in the picture, the rest of them couldn't run a lemonade stand. Maybe you could... you know?

Adam Jensen: You think I just walk around shooting people?

Milena Epstein: Don’t you?

Adam Jensen: I like knowing there are other options.

Milena Epstein: OK. So stab him. Scare him. Or get the police to do their job for once. I remember Drahomír mentioning this cop who threatened him, she was hanging around his checkpoint. Who knows, maybe there really is one good cop in Prague?

Adam Jensen: That sounds like the safest bet. Otherwise you're asking me to pick a fight with a bunch of guys in uniforms. Scam artists or not...

Milena Epstein: The whole city would come down on you.... Still, up to you how you want to handle it.

Adam Jensen: Right... And just so were clear you are going to stop forging documents now?

Milena Epstein: I don't like getting into trouble. And even worse is other people suffering because of me. No more faking documents ever again... Unless... someone really really needed one. Then I'd probably do it. I mean, if we knew for a fact that we could help someone, we should do whatever we can, right?

Adam Jensen: I think it's time to get you away from that forging equipment.

Milena Epstein: Right... OK. But, you're really not going to ask me about that whole “helping people” thing? What do you say? Team up? Help some dejected Augs together?

Adam Jensen: I think you've helped enough, don't you?

Milena Epstein: I'm sorry you feel that way. I guess this is goodbye.

Adam Jensen: I've already taken care of the guys outside. They won't be a problem.

Milena Epstein: Thank you. As mysterious military types go, you're pretty neat I guess. By the way, there's a safe over there where they keep their money, I'll give you the code. Two, four, eight, nine. Feel free to help yourself.

Adam Jensen: What about you?

Milena Epstein: Way ahead of you.

[Adam returns to Drahomír.]

Drahomír Koníčky: So, my friend? You have the card now, yes?

Adam Jensen: I know all about your extortion scheme, Drahomír. I'm here to put a stop to it.

Drahomír Koníčky: (frightened) I don't know what you're talking about… But I tell you what. You get out of here. Right now. And I'll forget all about your outdated documents.

Adam Jensen: I know you're not a real cop. And I know the forgeries you sell don't even work anymore. How much longer you think you can keep this up once people realize you're just a conman?

Drahomír Koníčky: The Aug permits may not work anymore, but my police credentials... very convincing. Show the right piece of paper here, fill the right pocket there. The cops won't touch me. Not over this.

Adam Jensen: Good thing I'm not a cop.

Drahomír Koníčky: Look, ah, Milena's the one you want. OK? She makes the forgeries. I'm just a... middleman.

Adam Jensen: I've heard enough from Milena to know that isn't true.

Drahomír Koníčky: You spoke to her? Look, this was never personal. If you value your life, don't make it personal now. I will kill to protect what is mine.

[Adam walks away.]

Woman Police Officer: Damn hanzer. You should be in Golem City with all the rest of your terrorist friends.

[Adam approaches another woman police officer.]

Woman Police Officer 2: Not from here, are you?

Adam Jensen: What gives it away?

Woman Police Officer 2: You just walked up to a police officer. And I have this funny feeling you expect something good to come out of it.

Adam Jensen: I recently got stopped at a fake checkpoint. Heard there was a cop around here who might know what I'm talking about.

Woman Police Officer 2: Drahomír... He's a slippery fuck. Pays off all the right people. Provides all these bullshit documents that "prove" he's legit. Regional inspector my ass. I'm putting a file together.

Adam Jensen: A file? The guy's dressing up like a cop and harassing Augs in the street.

Woman Police Officer 2: Sounds like ninety-percent of the people work with. Listen the right amount of coin in the right kind of pocket, fancy looking paperwork - those things go a long way in this city. Especially if the perception is that he's not really doing anything wrong. Just giving Augs a hard time.

Adam Jensen: There's more to it than that.

Woman Police Officer 2: That's exactly what I think. Why don't you fill me in. What's Drahomír been up to behind my back?

Adam Jensen: There was a girl named Milena. The way she tells it, she was forced at gunpoint to work for Drahomír. They kept her in a little room and made her forge documents for them.

Woman Police Officer 2: Why didn't she go to the police?

Adam Jensen: She was scared. A lot of people are scared.

Woman Police Officer 2: Yeah, of course they are. Prague's going to hell. The bad cops don't care and the good ones are too busy filling out forms. Fuck it. Drahomír's been pulling this shit for long enough and I'm sick of being told to ignore it.

[The detachment of policemen goes to Dragomir. The shooting begins. Adam calls Milena.]

Adam Jensen: Milena, I've got an update on your friend Drahomír.

Milena Epstein: I’ve seen Drahomír pretend to be many things. "My friend" was never one of them.

Adam Jensen: It's been taken care of. He's not going to be a problem anymore.

Milena Epstein: Thank God I don't know how you did it, but I’m glad you did. Listen, if you ever need documents for something…

Adam Jensen: I’ll be fine. Thanks.

[Adam leaves the neighborhood and goes to Koller's bookstore. When he eliminates all the bandits, he gets a call from Václav himself. ]

Václav Koller: Jensen, thank god. I'm down in the dungeon, man. You remember the title of my super-secret book, right?

Adam Jensen: I remember it's red.

[He pushes the secret book on the shelf and enters Votslav's secret hideout.]

Václav Koller: Jensen. My favorite techno-wunderkind! Sorry about the goons, man. They-ch, they didn't give you too much trouble, did they?

Adam Jensen: Nothing I couldn't handle. What do they want? You behind on your protection money?

Václav Koller: Iiiii-- I don't think it's about money. I got this little misunderstanding with their boss, Otar. You know how it is with these gangster types.

Adam Jensen: Enough to know there's no such thing as a little misunderstanding.

Václav Koller: Dvali internal politics. I-- I'm gonna get it sorted. Gonna see the big boss myself. As soon as things settle down. The day after a bombing, man, it’s well, I mean it's scary right!? I'm surprised people go out at all!

Adam Jensen: Sometimes people don't have a choice... My systems took a hit. was hoping you could help me get everything running again.

Václav Koller: Took a hit, you mean? Aww, shit... Why didn't you say so!? We need to get you in the chair. The chair. You know I've always wanted to get a closer look at those Sarif augs of yours. Real close look. So… So let's strap you in, get the gas going and-- and-- well, then just need to sort dive in. Feel my way around.

Adam Jensen: Hang on a sec. You're gonna put me under for how long? What if the Dvali send reinforcements?

Václav Koller: Aww, you're just stalling. Those illiterates aren't gonna get in here. Don't be scared of the chair, OK? The chair is gentle, I promise. This thing with the Dvali, it's nothing. Otar's pissing where he shouldn't.

Adam Jensen: I count on you to fix me, Koller. To some extent, your problems are my problems.

Václav Koller: That's sweet, Jensen. Otar Botkoveli is the Dvali number two guy. The men outside, they were his men. But the BIG BOSS MAN is Radich Nikoladze. He is a number one guy. And I know Radich, so... so don't worry about it. Now are we gonna do this procedure or what?

Adam Jensen: Alright, let's just get this over with.

Václav Koller: Relax, Jensen. It's-- it's gonna be fine. You-- You won't even know I'm in there. You'll feel weightless... Far away... Like you're someone else... But Koller's gonna bring you back and make you you again... Before you know it.

[He begins to drill. Adam closes his eyes... and after a while he hears a call for help.]

Václav Koller: Shit! Jensen! Wake up, man, wake up!... Oh, not again. Shit, shit, shit...

Adam Jensen: ...Ugh... wha-What?

Václav Koller: Oh, thank god. Take it easy... I swear I didn't mean to-- Your retinal display should be back soon. You can still move, right?

Adam Jensen: What did you?

Václav Koller: I was-- I was trying to connect the unconnected! But you got some strange fucking augs back there... I mean I-I probably shouldn't have - Here, let me get you some water. Or something stronger maybe?

Adam Jensen: Water.

Václav Koller: You got it, Jensen. Just, uh-- Just ease out of it, OK? Don't freak out. Rebooting was the only way to save you.

Adam Jensen: Save me from what, Koller?

Václav Koller: Core meltdown. You almost melted my chair! So I reset you and I found these-- these-- Uhhh, I think it's better if I show you what I found. Bring up your system display. You need to see this for yourself. These are your implants. You're familiar with all these, right?

Adam Jensen: Yeah, David Sarif installed them. Took two years for my body to get used to everything.

Václav Koller: Right. Well... I had to undo some of that "getting used to".

Adam Jensen: What's going on, Koller? Why do I feel different?

Václav Koller: Something was trying to vampire the juice out of you. I couldn't figure out what until after the reboot. Turns out your factory zero is not the standard factory zero.

Adam Jensen: What am I looking at?

Václav Koller: Experimental fucking test augs, man. Hidden inside your body.

Adam Jensen: You're telling me I got more implants than I thought I did?

Václav Koller: More than your body can handle. Pretty cool, right?

Adam Jensen: I'm not sure yet.

Václav Koller: I wanna show you what happens when you activate one of these suckers. Try one of the new augs. Don't be scared of what you are, man. See that! Major spike in your power consumption!

Adam Jensen: Where the hell did these things come from?

Václav Koller: I can't answer that. All I know is the explosion must have woken them up. But man, you wanna use these crazy fucking things, that's your right! We just gotta make sure it doesn't fry you. Now I think I maybe got an idea on how to do that. Try shutting down one of your other implants. You know, just for fun! Go ahead, Jensen. Shut down one of the implants you're not using. See that! Cooled you right down! You have the power to balance You have the power to balance your system if you want. Just, you know, don't activate everything all at once.

Adam Jensen: What would happen if I did?

Václav Koller: You'd suffer some major glitches due to overheating. You'd suffer some major glitches due to overheating. So, you know, maybe don't do that.

Adam Jensen: Alright, reset me now, Koller. I'll reactivate what I need myself. x

Václav Koller: OK, so I'm not always gonna be there for you like this. I can't just follow you around to reset things and hold your neural weave together. Whatever choices you make from here on out, they're your choices.

Adam Jensen: Thought you were supposed to be my aug expert?

Václav Koller: I specialize in Chinese black market OK? The shit found hidden inside you, spliced into your system like that looks to me like it's from MARS, man!

Adam Jensen: I'm pretty sure they're not from Mars.

Václav Koller: I just-- I feel bad. You deserve answers I can't give you. I can help manage you stem better than anyone in Prague. Help you make the most of the new augs we just found...

Adam Jensen: But you can't tell me where the hell they came from... As far as I know, David Sarif installed all my augs. If there's something inside me I don't
know about, he's the one I need to talk to.

Václav Koller: I am familiar with Sarif's work. These new augs, they-- they look different to me. I mean, that neodymium shell... who uses dimorphic magnetorheological fluid like that! Seriously, if you talk to Sarif, you need to ask him that. Shit really stands out. Pretty fucking cool actually.

Adam Jensen: You ever seen anything like this before? An aug system that's deliberately hidden like that?

Václav Koller: I don't know, Jensen. I mean I heard of people getting the black market treatment before. Pass out in Prague, wake up in Shanghai. But usually, they wake up with less augs. Not more.

Adam Jensen: What exactly makes these augs so different from my other ones?

Václav Koller: They look like experiments is what. Loose wiring everywhere, man. It's like half of you is... untested, unfinished, unbelievable! It's-- This beautiful is what it is.

Adam Jensen: Why would Sarif have hidden these things inside me? I don't get it.

Václav Koller: I'm not convinced this is a Sarif job. The tech itself is super gozel, but the PEDOT insulation, sloppy, the bone mounting, mounted on the quick. Just doesn't have Sarifs touch. Looks more like a retrofit to me. Something much more recent. Wh-- what are you thinking?

Adam Jensen: I'm thinking how much I hate being unconscious. You said these additions look recent. How recent?

Václav Koller: Within the last two years. Give or take. Something happen to you in that time?

Adam Jensen: I was pulled out of the ocean and put in some facility in Alaska to recover. There's a few months there that... The more I try to remember, the blurrier it gets.

Václav Koller: Shiit, Jensen. That's terrifying.

Adam Jensen: This tune-up went longer than I expected. Let's wrap this up.

Václav Koller: Right. Here, take some Praxis kits for the trouble. Praxis solves everything! Keeps customers happy! Just... remember what I showed you about managing your juice. It's gonna be a balancing act for you. Well, unless...

Adam Jensen: Unless what, Koller?

Václav Koller: There could be a way to optimize. It's just-- it would involve getting something from Otar... a neuroplasticity calibrator.

Adam Jensen: If there's a way for me to use everything I have, without compromise, I want to know about it.

Václav Koller: I was hoping you'd say that. I order all my fancy tech from this illegal catalog, right? But-- my last shipment got intercepted by Otar Botkoveli.

Adam Jensen: The same Otar whose men were looking for books out there before?

Václav Koller: I'm not gonna force you. I want you to want to do it. I want you to want to be an augmented god among men! If that sounds like something that interests you, then you should know that Otar runs an underground casino in the Čistý (Clean) district. The entrance is in a small courtyard off Hlavní (Main) Street.

Adam Jensen: Thanks for the info, Koller. And thanks for the Praxis. 

[Adam leaves the bookstore. He gets a call from Miller.]

Director James Miller: Jensen, it's Miler. Listen, I need your eyewitness report as soon as possible. What's your ETA?

Adam Jensen: Depends on how many cops ask to see my papers. 

Director James Miller: Fuck. Not much I can do about state police, after yesterday's attack… Get in when you can. Miller, out.

[Adam goes down to the subway and rides to Čistý (Clean) district.]

Police Officer 1: Unless you're looking for trouble, keep moving.

Police Officer 2: You look like trouble. We will be keeping an eye on you.

[He enters a building that looks like a warehouse and goes down in a freight elevator.]

Adam Jensen: Alex, this whisper-chip you gave me, it's an easy plant? 

Alejandra Vega: You're heading into TF29? Aiready?

Adam Jensen: Our enemies aren't waiting around while we lick our wounds.

Alejandra Vega: Fair enough. There'll be a data port on the NSN's motherboard. Access it and then just plug and play. Or plug and record, in this case.

Adam Jensen: Got it. I'll let you know when it's done. 

[Adam finds himself in a large facility filled with all kinds of equipment. There are people bustling about everywhere. It is Task Force 29 headquarters.]

Aria Argento: Adam! You're here, you made it in. It's good to see you're okay. 

Adam Jensen: Hey, Aria. Yeah, it was a close call. I got lucky. A lot of people didn't.

Aria Argento: I was here working when the first reports came in. It was chaos-phones ringing off the hook, people yelling, scrambling to find out what was going on. Then when Miller told me you were there-- 

Adam Jensen: I'm alright 

Aria Argento: Good. You looking for him? Cause he's tied up right now. A meeting with Lyon, I think.

Adam Jensen: Really? He's using the NSN right now? 

Aria Argento: Yeah. I just saw him -- Oh hey! That reminds me, here’s yours.

Adam Jensen: What's this? 

Aria Argento: The card for the shooting range. Chang changed all the codes this morning, said something about only giving access to people he's vetted personally. The bombing really freaked him out. Third one in six months, can you believe it?! I just -- I'm really glad you're okay. 

Adam Jensen: Thanks, Aria. I'll let you get back to what you were doing. 

Aria Argento: Yeah, I better get back downstairs, it's gonna be a busy day. Come by later if you wanna talk. 

Adam Jensen: Copy that. 

[He walks around for a while, exploring the headquarters.]

Agent: Give us a minute. My boss hasn't checked in for days. It occurs to me that he might be buried somewhere in the rubble. 

Agent 2: Hey, Agent Jensen, nice work in Dubai. But still you know what wanna know is, who those auged-up guys in the gold masks were.

Agent 3: I'll be compiling all the case files. As soon as I know anything, it'll be up on the board.

[Finally, Adam finds McCready's office.]

Duncan MacReady: Is there something I can help you with, Agent? 

Adam Jensen: I hear you're on point looking into the gold masked mercs that hit us in Dubai. Any leads yet? 

Duncan MacReady: (smirks) Christ, I know I'm good, Jersen, but I've only been on it for five minutes.

Adam Jensen: A lot can happen in five minutes, Madready. You check with the M.E. yet? Get anything off the bodies we recovered? 

Duncan MacReady: Leftovers are on ice at the Oman sub-station. I've been told they were scrubbed clean as summer whites. No prints, no dental... no nothing.

Adam Jensen: So in other words, it's no steps forward, and two steps back.

Duncan MacReady: And it's a fact made especially fucking infuriating because we lost a good agent in the process. It was our job to keep Singh safe, and we failed. Think we both deserve to take that on the chin.

Adam Jensen: No arguments here. 

Duncan MacReady: Oh good! Glad we agree on one thing, at least. Now, don't we both have investigations to get back to?

Adam Jensen: Yeah. I'll see you around, MacReady.

[Adam visits Peter Chung of the Cybercrime Division.]

Peter Chang: My god, Jensen, I heard about the explosion. We should relocate. I was thinking we could corner Director Miller together. Tell him… Tell him it's just not safe enough here. 

Adam Jensen: We're fine, Chang.

Peter Chang: The police station, the train station, we're next, I can feel it. I can more than feel it. I can see it happening.

Adam Jensen: No one knows where we are. There's no reason to get paranoid. 

Peter Chang: That's where you're wrong. They're trying to pull the lid off us, Jensen. Or seineones. Praha Dovoz just got hacked. 

Adam Jensen: Our building's front company? I thought it was fake.

Peter Chang: I wish it was fake. Miller's got me cleaning up Intellicam footage from the attack to help figure out who these people are. Meanwhile, maybe they're trying to figure out who we are? Why else poke into an import company? 

Adam Jensen: You think someone's figured out that the company's a front. Maybe they know what's really down here. 

Peter Chang: We have a lot of enemies. The people who bombed the train station, you don't think 
they'd love to know where we are? You need to help me figure out who's looking into us and make them stop. 

Adam Jensen: I'm going to need more information about this snoop of yours... 

Peter Chang: I don't know for sure that our cover's been blown. But, if it has, we need to know before our enemies have a chance to do something about it.

Adam Jensen: You got an MO on this hacker? 

Peter Chang: At first I thought it might be the Collective. 

Adam Jensen: But you're not convinced. 

Peter Chang: Not Janus's style to leave crumbs this big. But, whoever it is, they risk exposing us. If the Collective ever found out where we operate... my god, Jensen.

Adam Jensen: Maybe Janus knows already. 

Peter Chang: Hey, hey-- don't say shit like that. I get nervous enough as it is. I need you to find out as much as you can about our snoop. Make sure we're not in danger. 

Adam Jensen: Alright. You have any leads?

Peter Chang: I traced our hacker snoop to an unrented apartment. Top floor, 33 Hlavní. Just down the street. This guy walks by us every single day. Probably walks in. 

Adam Jensen: You're kidding? 

Peter Chang: See, you feel it now? The constant buried alive feeling? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought we were supposed to be suspicious of things that go on outside these walls.

Adam Jensen: It's never that simple. 

Peter Chang: Just get into that apartment. Access the computer they used and find out what you can. And be careful, Jensen. We don't know who we're dealing with.

Adam Jensen: I'll look into it. Soon as I know something, so will you.

Agent 4: There was another attempt to breach our firewall last night. 

[Adam hacks into networks and reads personal correspondence of employees, trying not to attract attention to himself. Alex calls him.]

Alejandra Vega: Adam, how's it going? Any trouble with the plan?

Adam Jensen: Patience, Alex. I'm trying to find the best way to access the motherboard. Without blowing my cover.

Alejandra Vega: Sorry, man. Message received.

[Adam continues his investigation.]

Brian Rourke: What the hell were those gate crashers after, anyway? They gun down the black market sellers, and Agent Singh.

Agent 5: It sucks, you know. Poor Arun. I owe him a hundred credits from the last time we played poker. I'll get his wife something nice.

[After many hacks and secret break-ins into various offices, Adam manages to place the chip.]

Adam Jensen: Alex, the whisper-chip is in. 

Alejandra Vega: (via phone) Weird, it's already picking up a frequen-- Jesus, Adam, is Miller is there right now?

Adam Jensen: Shit. Gotta go.

Director James Miller: (via phone, serious tone) Jensen, I need to see you. Now.

[Adam walks briskly to Miller's office.]

Adam Jensen: Agent Jensen reporting for duty, sir. Tried to do it earlier, but you were on a conference call. 

Director James Miller: Yeah. I was. Should I be worried about you, Jensen? 

Adam Jensen: Sorry? 

Director James Miller: That blow you took to your systems. It's not messing with your head or anything? Making you do things? 

Adam Jensen: I'm not going to go crazy and start attacking people, if that's what you're worried about.

Director James Miller: You've been checked out, then? The problem with your augs is gone? 

Adam Jensen: I took care of it. 

Director James Miller: Good. Good. God knows, with all that's happened, I need you at one hundred percent right now. 

Adam Jensen: You sounded pissed when you called me in. Everything okay? 

Director James Miller: Don't ever leave the field, Jensen, you'll regret it. Soon as you strap a desk to your ass you'll be swimming in goddamn politics. 

Adam Jensen: The bosses giving you trouble? 

Director James Miller: What? Ah, that. No, the trouble is State Police. They're pushing us out of the Růžička investigation. I want you over there to make sure that doesn't happen.

Adam Jensen: You're putting me on the train station attack? Not Dubai? 

Director James Miller: Forget Dubai. MacReady's handling it. 

Good. Thought I'd have to fight him to let me handle this one. Whoever planted those bombs yesterday has a lot to answer for.

Director James Miller: Agreed. And we have to find out who they are before the State Police fuck up our crime scene. 

Adam Jensen: You said they're trying to push us out? 

Director James Miller: I sent Fletcher in this morning, to oversee evidence collection. Seems he's being detained... because he hasn't checked in since. 

Adam Jensen: They can't lock us out. The Czech Republic signed our U.N. mandate agreement. They gave us jurisdiction over terrorist investigations.

Director James Miller: Yeah, well, the former director of their Security Information Services runs State Police now. He's come up with a loophole, claiming this attack falls under the "homegrown" terror 
exemption.

Adam Jensen: Homegrown? He's saying it's ARC? The Augmented Rights Coalition? 

Director James Miller: I don't care what he's saying. He may even be right. I just want us in there so we can find out.

Adam Jensen: Chang said you've got him cleaning up Intellicam footage that was captured during the 
bombing. Maybe it can tell us something. 

Director James Miller: Maybe. But between you and me. Chang's become a little more... unglued since Růžička. Not sure we can wait for him to get his shit together.

Adam Jensen: So where do I start? 

Director James Miller: Technically, you're supposed to speak to our psychologist before getting back into action. 

Adam Jensen: I don't need a shrink 

Director James Miller: Convenient. Because she's not in the office right now. And I don't want to waste any more time. 

Adam Jensen: So how do I get to Růžička? Public transportation's not stopping there.

Director James Miller: It will for you, once I make a phone call. Head to the metro and call me when you're there. Good luck, agent.

Claiming Jurisdiction
[Adam leaves the Task Force building and goes to the subway, where a policeman stops him on the way.]

Police Officer: Hold it, clank. Let me see your permit. And be quick about it.

Adam Jensen: I'm sure you'll find everything in order, officer.

Police Officer: What's the matter, eh? An I holding you up from some important... Um... This is a B-H 8-4-7. 

Adam Jensen: Is that what it is? Sounds impressive. 

Police Officer: Are you going to be a problem? Eyes to yourself. Hmmm. You are cleared through this check point. Go about your business.

Adam Jensen: Alright, Miller, I'm at the metro.

Director James Miller: (via phone) Perfect timing. Chang says your "private charlot" will arrive any time you call up Růžička Station on the map.

Adam Jensen: Chang? You had him hack into Prague's Public Transit Company so I could get to 
Růžička?

Director James Miller: (via phone) Plan A wasn't working.

[Adam gets on the train and goes to Růžička. Upon arrival, he finds a worried Fletcher.]

Daniel Fletcher: Jensen! What's wrong, what are you doing here? 

Adam Jensen: Miller sent me to find you. Thought you might've run into trouble. 

Daniel Fletcher: He said that? Did he use those exact words? 'Cause it's not my fault! 

Adam Jensen: What happened, Smiley? 

Daniel Fletcher: One minute I'm in there running the show and the next they accuse me of trying to tamper with evidence. Me! Can you believe that? I would never do that, Adam.
Never! 

Adam Jensen: It's our crime scene.

Daniel Fletcher: Exactly, but try telling them that. The minute they went for their guns, I decided it was time to shut up and get out of there. They accuse me of tampering with evidence? They're probably destroying all the evidence there is right now! -- You know, at first thought it was about Sonia.

Adam Jensen: Sonia? Sonia who? 

Daniel Fletcher: Oh, just some girl I've been teaching English to. Turns out her husband is a little territorial. You know the type. 

Adam Jensen: Smiley. 

Daniel Fletcher: Right, back to the case. The thing is, I think I found something in there. Something big 
Something that could just blow this case wide open I just-- I just need to get a look at the scan of the blast area... So, actually, it's a good thing that you're here. I don't suppose you could "Jensen" your way in there and grab it for me? 

Adam Jensen: What do you think is on this scan?

Daniel Fletcher: It's evidence, Jensen, a 3D mass spectrometer scan of the explosion site.

Adam Jensen: And?

Daniel Fletcher: And, if I'd had one more minute in there, I'd have it with me right now, and I could find out. But the fact that they don't want me to see it, makes me want to see it even more, I'm sure it's important.

Adam Jensen: We need that evidence. 

Daniel Fletcher: Yes! Exactly! That's the spirit. We need it. But you won't be able to just walk in there and ask them for it, since you're Interpol and, you know, augmented. After yesterday's attack, they're not exactly fans of the, uh.... 

Adam Jensen: So where do I find it? 

Daniel Fletcher: The forensic team set up camp inside the tourist agency. Or--what used to be the tourist agency. Get to their set up, grab the DSD with the scan on it, and get out. Easy peasy. 

Adam Jensen: This could take a while, Smiley. 

Daniel Fletcher: Got it, I'll get out of your way, head back to HQ. Good luck, and, um, let's not tell Miller about this one, okay?

Adam Jensen: Right.

[Adam retrieves the evidence.]

Adam Jensen: Smiley. I've got the scan. 

Daniel Fletcher: (via phone) Yeah? Fantastic! Bring it back to my office, and we'll see if I'm right.

Adam Jensen: Copy that.

[He goes to Čistá Čtvrť - Palisady Palisade via train. An unfriendly officer stops him right on the exit.]

Police Officer: [A fucking aug in the Naturals train? Are you trying to start a panic? Give me your damned papers. Now, before I take you in.] 

Adam Jensen: I don't have time waste with this. Make it fast. 

Police Officer: [You think I don't understand you, aug? Here. Take these and get out of here. And the 
next time you take the train, use the aug car. We have enough trouble without shit-disturbers like you.]

Director James Miller: (via phone) What the hell did you do, Jensen?! State Police is saying another augmented terrorist just hit them of the train station!

They were interfering with evidence collection.

Director James Miller: (via phone) Fucking A... Now I'm ordering you to see our psychologist. Auzenne's in the office, waiting for you.

Adam Jensen: Copy that. Have to meet Smiley there anyway.

Director James Miller: (via phone) Well do it last, because Chang found us a new lead in the case. Intellicam footage fingering ARC. It's going to put you inside Golem City.

[Adam returns to Task Force 29 building. While he goes down on the elevator he gets a call from Alex.]

Alejandra Vega: (via phone) Adam, I finally decrypted the audio off the whisper-chip tap. Fucking gold, man. You gotta hear it.

Adam Jensen: I have my hands full right now. Tell me where you are and I'll come when I can. 

Alejandra Vega: (via phone) There's an old L.I.M.B. clinic in the Davny district. It's closed down, nobody goes there anymore. I'll be inside.

[Alex finds Fletcher in the Forensics lab.]

Daniel Fletcher: Hey, how's it going? Do you have the scan?

Adam Jensen: Yeah, it's right here. 

Daniel Fletcher: You're a life saver, Adam. Seriously. Miller was in a foul mood when he left here, I don't need to give him another excuse to chew me out. 

Adam Jensen: He left? Where'd he go? 

Daniel Fletcher: Didn't ask, didn't think he wanted me to know. Did those State Police jerks give you any grief? 

Adam Jensen: It's like you said, they shot first, so I took care of it. 

Daniel Fletcher: Oh, OK--Good, they had it coming. 

Adam Jensen: So, what's on the scan? 

Daniel Fletcher: Oh that, I have no idea. 

Adam Jensen: What? You told me you found something, something big.

Daniel Fletcher: I didn't say I knew what it was, Adam. I said it was something that 'could' blow this case, wide open. Now I don't know about you, but I'm not buying this whole "ARC did it" angle, I believe what the evidence tells me. This DSD has all the answers we need, from the chemical makeup of the explosive 
used down to the material in the victims clothing. I'm sure of it.

Adam Jensen: Ok, so how long until we're all sure of it? 

Daniel Fletcher: Oh, it'll take hours to sift through the data, and I'm seeing Sonia later to apologize for any issues I may have caused with the State Police -- plus I do have other cases to work on too, Adam. I'll let you know if I -- when I find something.

Adam Jensen: You do that. 

Daniel Fletcher: Take it easy.

Taking Care of Business
[Adam decides to visit the division psychiatrist as Miller insists.]

Delara Auzenne: Adam, I'm Delara Auzenne. I appreciate you coming in to speak with me, and, well... I know you're probably getting this from everyone today, but I need to ask-- are you okay? I've seen footage from the train station, but... being there must've--

Adam Jensen: Is that what this is about? 

Delara Auzenne: No... That was sympathy. This is a standard agent health interview to determine combat readiness. Here. I got you this from the dispensary, 

Adam Jensen: You got me Neuropozyne? Look, doc, I was caught off guard by a terrorist attack, 
It might've knocked some things out-of-whack, but it doesn't mean my body's going to start rejecting my augments.

Delara Auzenne: True. But traumatic experiences can kick a hornet's nest into the immune system. In 
patients with Neuroprosthetics-- 

Adam Jensen: Would you believe me if I told you my body doesn't reject mechanical implants? 

Delara Auzenne: No. But, my policy is for straight talk only in the room, so… if you want me to believe that you're some kind of medical miracle, I guess I have to go with it. Please, have a seat. I've been looking over your file. There's some very interesting history here. Mind if we take a trip down memory lane? 

Adam Jensen: Is this going to take long? 

Delara Auzenne: It says here that you were with Detroit SWAT, but left in 26 to head up Sarif Industries security division. David Sarif was at the center of America's augmentation debate. 

Adam Jensen: David Sarif always attracted a lot of controversy.

Delara Auzenne: Ah yes, I've seen some of his interviews. A firm believer in human enhancement technologies, I wonder if the incident changed his view. 

Adam Jensen: It certainly didn't seem that way on the day.

Delara Auzenne: You were with him then, in Panchaea, when the incident happened?

Adam Jensen: I don't remember. They tell me they pulled me out of the ocean but... a year of my life is still a blur. 

Delara Auzenne: Your memories may come back eventually. And if they do, my door is always open. Should you need to discuss anything.

Adam Jensen: I won't. But thanks. 

You're very lucky to be alive. Although I'm not so sure the world you've returned to makes you feel that way. You've become the enemy, which, actually leads me to my next question... So far no one's claimed responsibility for the attack at Růžička, but with the Human Restoration vote coming... well it's no secret Prague has become the symbol of legalized Augmented oppression. 

Adam Jensen: And the Augmented Rights Coalition is camperlatile back door, trying to expose and resist it.

Delara Auzenne: Most of the world thinks of them as terrorists. Augmented terrorists. If it turns out they are guilty, well… being Augmented yourself--

Adam Jensen: How am I gonna feel? Doesn't matter what I think about it, doc. I've got a job to do. I'm here to prevent further bloodshed - which is exactly what I intend to do.

Delara Auzenne: I hope that you can. Listen Adam. I know these kinds of conversations are a pretty 
major pain in the ass. I really do appreciate you taking the time to talk to me today. Thanks.

Adam Jensen: You mean I had a choice? 

Delara Auzenne: No. But the sentiment remains. I'll let the director know that I'm officially clearing you for the field.

Adam Jensen: Well... it's probably best if I get back to work, doc. I'll see you around.

Delara Auzenne: Thanks again for going over your file with me, Adam. I think most of the other agents see a plague cross on my door. 

[Adam leaves TF29 building.]

Alejandra Vega: (via phone) You didn't get held up at a checkpoint or something, did you? I'm inside the clinic, waiting for you.

Adam Jensen: Sorry, Alex. I'll be there as soon as I can. 

Alejandra Vega: (via phone) Hope you're not losing sight of what's important here. Sorry. This place just brings back memories. Don't take too long.

[Adam finds the abandoned clinic.]

Alejandra Vega: Hey. Glad you could make it. Any trouble getting away? 

Adam Jensen: Miller's been giving me some leeway, but not much. I did survive a terror attack.

Alejandra Vega: You and me both. God, sometimes I really hate this city. It used to welcome people like us, go out of its way to entice Augs to live here. This clinic was built because Prague saw us as its future. Now look at it. 

Adam Jensen: Times change, Alex.

Alejandra Vega: I know, trust me. Even got the scars to prove it.

Adam Jensen: We've been working together for a few months now. I still don't know much about you.

Adam Jensen: What, you trolling for my secrets now?

Adam Jensen: Just the good ones. How did you join the Juggernaut Collective? 

Alejandra Vega: They got me out of a tough spot. Before the incident. I was working for Belltower, flying V.I.P.S around Panama, and I stumbled into something big. Something very important people didn't want anyone to know about. So they ordered 
Belltower to kill me. 

Adam Jensen: Janus warned you? Got you out? 

Alejandra Vega: A friend of Janus's. Someone in the Collective, who used to work for Belltower, too. You don't mess with these people. Adam. Not by yourself. I learned that the hard way. 

Adam Jensen: You said we got something? 

Alejandra Vega: Yeah. Listen to this. 

[She plays the record.]

Miller: A little heads up would have been nice! 

Man 2: Sending your team to Dubai was my call but now we need to go by the book. Focus on ARC.

Miller: You want me to pin all of this on them? The bombings in Prague, the break-in at VersaLife. Dubai? 

Man 2: Officially, all five attacks involved augmented terrorists. Is that clear? 

Miller: Yes, sir. But send the reports if you want me to prove it. Because ARC doesn't operate in North America!

Alejandra Vega: They're setting up ARC, Adam. They sent you into that ambush in Dubai, and now they want to pin everything on the Augmented Rights Coalition! I told you Miller was dirty!

Adam Jensen: Sounds to me like Miller's following orders. It also sounds like he's not happy about it.

Alejandra Vega: Alright, whatever. Maybe he's just a stooge. You can't say the same about the man he's talking to. 

Adam Jensen: His boss, Joseph Manderley.

Alejandra Vega: Director of TF29 operations worldwide! The only person at Interpol higher than him is 
the General Secretariat. 

Adam Jensen: We need to play this smart, Alex, think about what we heard... What was that bit about 
VersaLife? 

Alejandra Vega: You mean the break in that never happened? Yeah, I started digging into that right 
after I decrypted the conversation. 

Adam Jensen: What'd you find? 

Alejandra Vega: Like I said, man. It's the break in that never happened. Versalife is one of the biggest 
pharma companies on the planet--the only one still manufacturing Neuropozyne. If it got broken into, it would've been big news.

Adam Jensen: So why are they saying it did...? VersaLife doesn't produce just Neuropozyne. They've got a huge research and development division.

Alejandra Vega: Yeah? So? What does that have to do with ARC? Why frame them for a break-in? 

Adam Jensen: If they want them to look like terrorists, I guess it depends on what they'll say was stolen... See what the Collective can dig up. If this really is a conspiracy, that break-in will be the thread to pull on. 

Alejandra Vega: What are you gonna do? 

Adam Jensen: I'm gonna to finish my investigation, find out who really bombed the station, I'll let you 
know what I turn up. 

Alejandra Vega: Same here. Good luck, Adam.

[She turns invisible and leaves. Adam calls Miller.] 

Miller. We still going to Golem City? 

Director James Miller: (via phone) You are. Meet me at Kopecky's puppet shop. Your pilot's en route . I'll brief you there.

Adam Jensen: Copy that.

[Adam meets up with Miller.]

Director James Miller: (talking on his phone) Look, I gotta go. I'll call you later.

Adam Jensen: Problems? 

Director James Miller: Nothing I can't handle. We're just waiting on Chikane. 

Adam Jensen: So, tell me about this new lead then. The Intellicam footage? 

Director James Miller: State police dropped it off this morning, badly corrupted. But Chang worked his magic and managed to recover some images. They show an Aug in a yellow hoodie, dropping bags where each bomb went off. 

Adam Jensen: You ran facial recognition? You got an I.D.? 

Director James Miller: Couldn't see his face. But the bags are the same ones used by Talos Rucker and his 
aid workers in the Utulek Complex. 

Adam Jensen: That's a stretch. 

Director James Miller: Three bombings in Prague in six months, Jensen. All of them after the leader of ARC took up residence in that ghetto. Rucker needs to answer for these attacks. Here's Chikane now. 

Elias Chikane: Am I late? Or are you two early? 

Director James Miller: You're right on time. Agent Jensen was just agreeing that we need to bring Rucker in.

Elias Chikane: Quick snatch and grab. Should be easy enough.

Adam Jensen: So we've already decided he's guilty? 

Director James Miller: We just need to talk to him. On our terms -- not when he's surrounded by fanatics. Getting into Golem isn't the problem. Reaching Ruckers. ARC territory is fiercely defended. No one sets foot in there.

Adam Jensen: Not even the State Police? 

Elias Chikane: They can't. Rucker wasn't forced into Golem City. He bought his way in.

Director James Miller: Blackmailed would be more apt. He threatened to go public with evidence of a humanitarian crisis. One that the United Nations Security Council had swept under the rug.

Elias Chikane: Got them to force the Czech government to hand over part of the Utulek Complex to him. A little bit of "hush" real-estate, so to speak.

Adam Jensen: He stays quiet and guarantees safety for himself and his followers. Smart. So how do get in? 

Director James Miller: I've made a deal with an ARC prospect named Tibor Sokol. Promised to get his family out of the complex, so long as he gets you past ARC's checkpoints. 

Elias Chikane: You trust him? 

Director James Miller: We have to. It's that or nothing. Sokol will meet you at an apartment in the housing district, number two-three-seven. Any questions? 

Adam Jensen: Let's get this over with.

Director James Miller: Let me know when you've gel Rucker. (leaves)

Elias Chikane: Goddamn, Jensen, every time I look at you, I can't believe the amount of jewelry you've got on. Tell me, how's that aftermarket shit working out for you? 

Adam Jensen: Never better. Maybe you should reconsider. What with that limp. 

Elias Chikane: Naw, I like my limp. Keeps me honest. You ready to light-out? 

Adam Jensen: You're my only back-up on this one. Before we leave, I'd like to know you've actually got my back.

Elias Chikane: Trust me. I flew ten years in the S-Double A-F and five in the private sector moving corporate heads. And in all that time, I've never lost a fare.

Adam Jensen: How many years with TF29? 

Elias Chikane: Two. Which is a year and a half longer than you, from what I understand. So, you want to keep talking resumes, waste more of our time? Or will you trust me to get the job done? 

Adam Jensen: I still have some things I need to take care of before we leave. 

Elias Chikane: Alright, go on then. Get your shit sorted. I'll be here. Waiting.

Samizdat
[Adam decides to take a closer look at Chang's problem. In order to do so, he goes to the building where the computer used for the correspondence is located and hacks into it. Adam pretends to be an employee of the organization and talks to another employee of the organization via chat.]

K: Why are you online?
Sewer standup was FIVE MINUTES AGO and you're not even in Dávný? 
I want to lead with your Praha Doboz story!
*Praha Dovoz

Little K (Jensen): What's the rush?

K: Just a little something called SAMIZDAT ISSUE 67!
Thought you had a scoop about the import company!

Little K (Jensen): Sounds like something we should talk about in person. Where are you?

K: Same place I was yesterday and the day before that.
Underground.
Take the manhole by the music store or the old church.

END OF CONVERSATION

[Adam calls Chang.]

Adam Jensen: Chang, I think I have something on our secret admirer. Group called Samizdat mean anything to you?

Peter Chang: (via phone) You mean those conspiracy nuts? Very bad for business. How much do they know?

Adam Jensen: Not sure. They're hiding somewhere in the sewers. In the Dávný district.

Peter Chang: (via phone) Find out whatever you can. What they know. What they want. If they blow the Task Force's cover, it's only a matter of time before someone blows up the Task Force.

Adam Jensen: Don't worry, Chang. I don't want the walls coming down just yet.

[Adam goes down into the sewers to meet a samizdat employee. He finds a group of homeless people warming themselves by a makeshift fire.]

Homeless Woman: Those augs are pretty quiet, clank. Know what would be even more quiet? If you weren't around here. 

Homeless Woman 2: I do not talk to strangers. And you are definitely a stranger.

[Adam soon manages to find a secret samizdat base. In a room with a small number of computers there are three people - two men and one woman. One of the men is the same person Adam was chatting with.]

Man: Don't shoot! We're journalists! 

Woman: Shit. Who invited the agent type? 

K: Who are you? What do you want? Why are you here? You here because of that Dubai story? The article about the moon base? The clones? The clones on the moon base? Who sent you? 

Adam Jensen: I'm here for Samizdat. You in charge? 

K: I take charge but I'm not in charge, man. No one owns or dictates the truth. Freedom of information is a collective right and a collective responsibility. That said. You gotta break someone's nose, you break my nose. 

Adam Jensen: Alright, we can start with that if you want. 

K: Whoah, whoah, whoah. We don't have to start with that. Do we? 

Adam Jensen: How about we skip being courageous and move on to why I'm here? 

K: Hey, I'm not the one with a problem here, man. So you say whatever you came to say. I'm listening. It's what I do. Close my eyes and listen to the whispers in the dark... 

Adam Jensen: What do you know about Praha Dovoz? 

K: That little "import" company? I know there's more than boxes in the basement. We've seen agent types come in and out. The place is a curtain. The first in a series of many. 
Pull them all back and you'll find… Them. Tell me I'm wrong.

Adam Jensen: It's a dead end. 

K: Right. Guys like you always come down here because of dead ends. 

Adam Jensen: Fine, what if it's something other people are already looking into? If someone like you makes too much noise, that may compromise any chance they have of uncovering something bigger. Do you understand? 

K: I'm supposed to believe we're colleagues now? You men in black types. You walk into Picus newsroom, tell them to be hush-hush about something, and they do it. But that's not how it works here. One day you will all be exposed. If not by me, then someone just like me. Samizdat isn't one voice. K isn't one man. 

Adam Jensen: I need you to stop looking into Praha Dovoz, but not for the reasons you assume.

K: Relax, I get it. You don't think I do, but I do. You gotta appease your military industrial masters. We've all been there, man. 

Adam Jensen: I'm not who you think I am. The kinds of people who manipulate the news, who cover 
things up… You don't need to convince me that's who the enemy is.

K: The enemy is anyone who conceals the truth. And that's exactly what you're asking me to do. To pretend like that little import company isn't hiding something.

Adam Jensen: I'm asking you to see a difference between conspiracy and discretion. Between people who hide information in order to push their own agendas and those who need to stay off the radar in order to do their jobs. You of all people should understand. 

K: OK... OK, look, you seem like reasonable guy. Hell, I've usually been punched by now. I find this refreshing. Here's the deal. We promise to forget all about Praha Dovoz and stay out of your way 
as long as you give us something better. 

Adam Jensen: What do you suggest? 

K: The only thing I hate more than secret organizations are toothless media conglomerates who don't hold anyone accountable, who spit lie after lie after lie. So I propose a trade. There are places my people can't get into. You get into one of those places and find me some dirt on the real enemy here: Picus, media. Do that and I'll cut whatever you want me to cut. Who knows, maybe you'll even learn something? 

Adam Jensen: You're going to forget everything you know about Praha Dovoz for now. It's the only 
way you get to protect your ideals. 

K: Right. Because concealing information is obviously the best way to keep people informed. You really think I'm that stupid? There's this word you might want to look up, it's called transparency. It means people have a right to know, no matter what the cost.

Adam Jensen: You're onto something that's even bigger than you imagine. Bigger than you can handle. Pull the trigger on it too early and you'll lose it forever. 

K: Yeah, or I sit on it too long and then lose it anyway. I don't know… You always have to keep digging. The truth, the real truth, it's a rare fucking bird, man. And if you're too slow, or too careful, it fucking flies off. So when I get so much as a hint of truth, Strike when I can as hard as I can.

Adam Jensen: Whatever the cost? Is that it? Or do you want to be better than Picus? They frighten people. They sensationalize the news. They misdirect. If you want to resist them, you need to strive to be objective. You need to deal in truths. And the truth is, putting Praha Dovoz under the spotlight right now is dangerous 
to me and useless to the public. Wait until it's time. 

K: OK, OK. I get it I don't want to compromise no one's investigative journalism. Sometimes you move too fast and the real story flies off before you even had a chance to see it. That's not what we do here. So you go break open whatever it is you're breaking open, and we'll lay off Praha Dovoz. For now. 

Adam Jensen: You're making the right choice. 

K: We'll see. You know, we could still use your help though. Journalistic integrity may not mean very much topside, but it still means something down here. And that's why I think you should help us. You're our best shot at hitting the mass media where it hurts.

Adam Jensen: I've got my own troubles to contend with. And so will you if I find out you compromised me. 

[He calls Chang.]

Adam Jensen: Chang, you there?

Peter Chang: What do you got for me?

Adam Jensen: Took care of Samizdat. No one's going to be reading anything about us any time soon.

Peter Chang: I'll cancel the movers. How'd you do it?

Adam Jensen: I've reasoned with them. They're not going to give us any trouble. 

Peter Chang: Reasoned? With the conspiracy nuts?

Adam Jensen: I know what I'm doing. 

The Calibrator
[Adam decides to visit Otar Botkoveli in his underground casino at Koller's request. But before that he goes to TechNoir.]

Costache: Welcome, welcome. 

Adam Jensen: Nice gear you've got here. 

Costache: All high-end, and you look like you know high-end. Which biotech did your job? Not Isolay... they don't come in black. 

Adam Jensen: You try this on all your customers?

Costache: Just the ones made of carbon fiber. As one enthusiast to another-- you can tell me.

Adam Jensen: Gonna have to disappoint you. 

Costache: Maybe you can make it up to me. You look like the kind of man who might have access to breach software. 

Adam Jensen: That stuff's illegal. 

Costache: Come on, man, don't play around. You know why it's illegal, you know the world, governments don't want us to find out their dirty secrets. But we will and you can help us. Be part of the revolution! Anyway, just think about it, all the details are in the computer. Want to have a look - to sell or to buy? 

Adam Jensen: Sure.

Costache: Great! Go ahead. Outstanding. Factory fresh. 

Adam Jensen: Nothing for me. 

Costache: I'm not going to pull a social aug on you. 

[Next he goes to Tubehouse Electronics.]

Vendor: Hey there - you looking for a new stereo system? 

Adam Jensen: I don't really get much time to listen to music.

Vendor: How about movies? You like movies? Or maybe you've got... other interests? 

Adam Jensen: What do you mean by 'other interests'? 

Vendor: Well, I figure, a man like you, he might need a little, energy boost, from time to time.

Adam Jensen: You're not talking about protein bars, are you? 

Vendor: Biocells, my friend. In perfect working order, and completely under the radar. 

Adam Jensen: I think I'll be on my way. 

Vendor: Feel free to come back if you change your mind. 

[And finally Adam goes underground. There he find a group of thugs - Otar and Vano.]

Otar Botkoveli: Like I'm always telling you, Vano, people in old country are more genuine. They treat each other with respect. If a man has something to say, he says it to your face, politely. That is what - What, what is it? 

Vano: (sees Adam) Go away, clank - we're closed! 

Otar Botkoveli: Oh, he is not here to gamble, Vano. ...Are you? 

Adam Jensen: You're Otar? 

Otar Botkoveli: I am Mr. Botkoveli, yes. And who are you? 

Adam Jensen: I'm here on behalf of a concerned third party. 

Otar Botkoveli: Oh, you hear that, Vano? Our guest is a very private person.

Adam Jensen: I've found it pays to be cautious, when you don't know exactly who you're dealing with. 

Otar Botkoveli: That is true, but sometimes it can create... problems which could have been avoided had they been more forthcoming. If neither man is willing to compromise, they cannot reach a satisfactory understanding.

Adam Jensen: I would like to avoid any misunderstandings. 

Otar Botkoveli: Good. So in this case, since you already know my name, and no doubt other things about me, I think you owe me the same courtesy.

Adam Jensen: I'm with Interpol - but I'm not here to cause any trouble, organized crime is someone else's department. I'm here to pick up the shipment you're withholding from Václav Koller. 

Otar Botkoveli: Vano, look - the only honest policeman in Prague! Koller must want this item very much, to send someone like you. But I will tell you what I told Koller: No. He cannot have the calibrator, and you can't, either. Dealing with Augs is bad business, a point which some people in this organization have yet to understand. 

Adam Jensen: I see. You're a man of principle. A businessman who cares for the organization he's part of. But there's more to my being here than maybe you realize. Koller is a friend. And sometimes helping out a friend in need is good business.

Otar Botkoveli: Oh, ho! You see, Vano, this is what I am always talking about - loyalty! So tell me, Mr. Friendship, how far are you willing to go, to help out a friend in need? 

Adam Jensen: If someone needs my help, I give it. Anyway I can.

Otar Botkoveli: Ha-ha ha ha ha... It is like I am always telling him, you can get a lot accomplished just by having a conversation. I will let you have the calibrator.

Adam Jensen: Thanks. And what's it gonna cost me?

Otar Botkoveli: Listen to the man, Vano! Even when he gets what he wants, he does not trust it. What shall we do with such a man? What will it cost? A favor. 

Adam Jensen: What kind of favor? 

Otar Botkoveli: Ah, don't worry, I will let you know in due time. It won't be too painful - not for you. So what do you say, do we have a deal, Mister...? 

Adam Jensen: Jensen. We have a deal.

Otar Botkoveli: Excellent! Upstairs in my office, you will find Koller's calibrator. I will be in touch.

[Adam takes the calibrator from Otar's office and calls Koller.]

Adam Jensen: Alright, Koller, I've got your neuroplasticity calibrator.

Václav Koller: (via phone) That's great! I'm gonna pencil you in for that optimization procedure. Just as soon as I'm done with this house call.

Adam Jensen: What house call? 

Václav Koller: (via phone) I got this other client, you know. Doesn't like to be kept waiting.

Adam Jensen: Neither do I, Koller. Call me when you're ready.

[He returns to Chikane.]

Elias Chikane: Daylight's wasting, boy. In case you haven't noticed. You good to go yet? 

Adam Jensen: Let's do this. 

Elias Chikane: Good. Strap in.

[They're taking off. As they fly, Adam checks the functioning of his augmentations.]

Elias Chikane: Interesting pre-game ritual you've got there. You getting pissed enough to end this guy? 

Adam Jensen: I got a "no kill" order. 

Elias Chikane: Is that right? Woulda thought he'd done enough to warrant extreme prejudice.

GOLEM CITY
OUTSKIRTS OF PRAGUE

Adam Jensen: How far out are we? 

Elias Chikane: Coming up on it now. Hmmm. Not many spots I can set her down. Got a preference?

Adam Jensen: Get as close to the ground as you can. I'll take it from there. 

Elias Chikane: Whatever you say, boss.

UTULEK COMPLEX

[Adam jumps off the plane.]

Elias Chikane: (via phone) Jensen, you still got all your parts together?

Adam Jensen: I'm fine. How close did you get me to our contact's location, housing unit two-three seven?

Elias Chikane: (via phone) Jesus, Jensen. I didn't put you on his doorstep. Residential sector should be just ahead of you. Me -- I'm gonna switch to auto pilot, have a coffee. Let me know if things get interesting.

The Rucker Extraction
[Adam walks to a police checkpoint.]

Police Officer: You must submit to an identification scan. 

Drone: Initiating a security scan. 

Police Officer: Welcome to Golem City, clank! 

[Adam finds Sokol's apartment.]

Woman: You people. Now what? What other lies have you come to tell me? 

Adam Jensen: I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm here to see Sokol. He's expecting me.

Woman: Which one? My husband Dusan or his foolish brother Tibor? I guess it doesn't matter which one, the police took them both to the Narrows, to torture them for information they DO NOT HAVE! 

Adam Jensen: It's bad in Prague, and it's even worse here. What happened? 

Woman: Have you no feelings?! My husband and his brother, both augmented people like you, were beaten and taken away by the police. Tibor said he knew someone who could get us out of here. Is that supposed to be you? 

Adam Jensen: Yes.

Woman: I'm sorry. Normally they only take ARC members. Tibor is ARC, he has been taken before. But now after the bombing, they come for Tibor, Dusan he asks why and then-- they take my Dusan. He has done nothing. NOTHING! 

Adam Jensen: Do you know where they were taken? 

Woman: I told you already, the Narrows. Instead of asking stupid questions, why don't you DO-- SOMETHING? Don't just stand there. They need help. Please.

[Adam leaves the apartment and calls Elias.]

Adam Jensen: Chikane, we got a problem. Our contact's been swept up by the police. 

Elias Chikane: (via phone) I heard about cops in Golem, Jensen. Your Interpol ID won't get you any kindness with them.

Adam Jensen: That's alright, I didn't bring it with me. They're holding him in a place called the Narrows. I'll contact you after I find him.

[Adam infiltrates the Narrows clogged with security guards and finds a prisoner in a transparent cell.]

Prisoner: Hey, brother! Watch it! The cops are everywhere today.

Adam Jensen: I noticed that. Are you Tibor? 

Tibor Botkoveli: Yes, you're late--Interpol. 

Adam Jensen: I know, I spoke to your sister-in-law. She told me what happened.

Tibor Botkoveli: Adela? Is she alright?

Adam Jensen: It seems like she can take care of herself. 

Tibor Botkoveli: Yes. She can. You know-- you know I can't help you. It's too dangerous now. 

Adam Jensen: Tibor, I can get you out of here. 

Tibor Botkoveli: And then what? They go back to my housing unit and take me again? 

Adam Jensen: And what if you 're not there? 

Tibor Botkoveli: NO! No-please, that will just make it worse. They know who I am, they-- they went after my family. 

Adam Jensen: Interpol has promised to get you and your family out of here to safety 

Tibor Botkoveli: Safety? There is no safety--only tyrants who prey on the weak and innocent. 

Adam Jensen: Alright. Tibor, listen, I understand why you can't come with me. But I still need to get to Rucker or what happened to you and your family today will happen to others. I'll smooth it over with Interpol. Is there any other way you could help me? 

Tibor Botkoveli: There's a man, a smuggler--Louis Gallois. He imports items for Talos, Neuropozyne, whiskey. He could get you in, but you'd have to do him a favor. He likes favors.

Adam Jensen: That's something. Any other ideas? 

Tibor Botkoveli: My key card to get to ARC territory… is gone, one of the cops took it. Probably still has it on him. 

Adam Jensen: Thanks, I'll look into it. 

Tibor Botkoveli: Please, I know you don't owe me anything, but if you see my brother Dusan, help him. If anything happens to him, Adela will kill me. 

Adam Jensen: Of that, I have no doubt, I'll see what I can do. (calls Elias) Chikane. Get a message to Miller. Sokol's backed out of the deal.

Elias Chikane: (via phone) Why I'm not surprised?

Adam Jensen: He's just looking after his family. Besides it's not a complete wash, he gave me some options on how to get into ARC on my own.

Elias Chikane: (via phone) Well just be careful, Jensen. The arsehole obviously can't be trusted. Let me know when you're in.

[Adam begins to slowly make his way through a building packed with police and machinery. After a while he gets a call from Otar.]

Otar Botkoveli: (via phone) Mister Jensen! This is Otar Botkoveli. I hear you are in the Ululek Complex.

Adam Jensen: Keeping tabs on me, Botkoveli? 

Otar Botkoveli: (via phone) It is time for that favor you owe me. There is a shopkeeper named Gallois, in the Stedry markets. I want you to eliminate him.

Adam Jensen: I'm not in the assassination game. 

Otar Botkoveli: (via phone) How your day care of this problem is your business, but I expect you to keep your word. (hangs up)

[Adam finds Louis.]

Louis Gallois: This is a pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting any customers today, given the unpleasantness outside.

Adam Jensen: Are you Louis Gallois? 

Louis Gallois: I am. If this is a referral, may I ask which of my customers was impressed enough to recommend me? 

Adam Jensen: Tibor Sokol.

Louis Gallois: Ah, poor Tibor. But how may I be of service? 

Adam Jensen: Let's talk about the Dvali crime family. 

Louis Gallois: Who are they? 

Adam Jensen: They're the people running organized crime in Prague. Their second-in-command is a man named Otar Botkoveli. Heard of him?

Louis Gallois: No, I'm sorry, I haven't. 

Adam Jensen: Well that's too bad. I was hoping you could tell me why he wants me to kill you.

Louis Gallois: (shocked) Shit! He wants me dead? Durak son of a bitch... 

Adam Jensen: Sounds like you're starting to remember him now. 

Louis Gallois: Yeah, yeah, Otar. He just slipped my mind for a moment. 

Adam Jensen: That's not the only thing slipping. 

Louis Gallois: Fine, smart guy. I work for Otar's boss, the head of the Dvali family, Radich Nikoladze. I spy on Otar's activities, for Radich. Shit, I just realized! The other pakhan, Konstantine, he died in the train station bombing! 

Adam Jensen: You're thinking Otar wants to get the second spy - you - out of the way, and make a move against Radich? 

Louis Gallois: I'm sure he'd love that. Those two have had their own private cold war going for years. But still, gelling rid of me and Konstantine wouldn't be enough. Otar needs to gather more support, in Prague and in Georgia.

Adam Jensen: But he could do it? 

Louis Gallois: The only thing keeping him from consolidating his power is... well, me. But you're not really planning to kill me, are you?

Adam Jensen: No. I draw the line at assassination for would-be mob bosses.

Louis Gallois: Thank you, thank you! What can I do to repay you? Name it - anything.

Adam Jensen: Václav Koller. What's his connection to Radich? 

Louis Gallois: Wait, I can't tell you that Radich would kill me! 

Adam Jensen: You said anything'. Unless you'd prefer the alternative.

Louis Gallois: Damn it... Okay, Radich, Koller, and I have a trilateral arrangement. Radich has an 
augmented leg - you just became the fifth living person to know that. So I get Radich his Neuropozyne, and Koller maintains his leg. In return, Radich looks out for us.

Adam Jensen: He's not doing a great job of that. You're lucky Otar sent me instead of somebody else. 

Louis Gallois: He won't stop with you, either. I'd better get out of the country until this blows over. And I guess I'll have to retire the Louis Gallois persona. Oh, well, I had fun playing him.

Adam Jensen: Next time, try it with a French accent, might be more credible. One more thing. Tibor said you could get me into ARC territory without worrying about any guards.

Louis Gallois: He's right! I'll unlock the security door at the back of this room. Beyond that, there's a 
ladder that'll take you where you want to go. 

Alright, thanks. 

Louis Gallois: Is there any other way I can be of service? Perhaps you'd like to make a purchase, and contribute to the Louis Gallois escape fund? 

Let's see what you've got for sale. 
for sale.

Louis Gallois: These are all the goods I have available. Nothing interests you? 

I'll be on my way for now. 

Louis Gallois: As you wish. But I hope to see you again. 

Adam Jensen: Bakoveli - it's Jensen. Your problem in the Utulek Complex has been taken care of.

Otar Botkoveli: (via phone) Good! I look forward to hearing the details. But that will have to wait, because I have other urgent matters keeping me busy at the moment. I will call you back shortly.

Elias Chikane: (via phone) Jensen, I'm getting lonely up here, you got an update for me?

Adam Jensen: Yeah, I discovered that favors are like currency in Golem City. We're back on track. I'm heading for an area called the Throat now. Should take me straight into ARC territory. 

Elias Chikane: (via phone) Good. I'll update Miller and do a flyby up ahead, get you the lay-of-the-land.

Adam Jensen: Copy that.

Police Officer: Come on, clank, give me a reason.

Adam continues to explore the complex. He sees two man dragging s robot.

Man: (having trouble dragging the robot) Viktor! We got one... Patrolling the market, just like you said it would be. 

Viktor Marchenko: (lifting the robot with one hand) I got it, brothers. Now. Let's see what we've got here. These little guys can be tricky. Every once in a while one of them will go off, even if you. (grunts of exertion)

[Viktor crashes the robot.]

Adam Jensen: Shoulda tried cutting the blue wire. 

Viktor Marchenko: If only life was that simple. You are lost, brother? It looks like you might have taken a wrong turn.

Adam Jensen: You must be the welcoming committee.

Viktor Marchenko: No. I am Marchenko, and Marchenko... He is more of a guardian. Like the hound at the gates of hell. Yes.

Adam Jensen: I'm not real big on the classics.

Viktor Marchenko: (laughs) That is a pity. What a man reads can tell you more about him than his face. Can I give you a little friendly advice? 

Adam Jensen: Sure. 

Viktor Marchenko: Go back. Go home. There is nothing for someone like yen here. 

Adam Jensen: How do you figure that? You don't know me. 

Viktor Marchenko: I know this place, up ahead. We call it "The Throat." And sometimes those get cut, yes? When outsiders come wandering in where they should not.

Adam Jensen: I'll take my chances. I just want to see where ARC hides out.

Viktor Marchenko: We are not hiding from anyone. 

Adam Jensen: Tell that to the cops down below. 

Viktor Marchenko: Do not listen to police and all their callshit about ARC. Those chlupati (hairy) pricks are everywhere, breaking heads, making their mess, and we have deal with it. Better watch yourself. They won't go easy on you either, leash or no leash. 

Adam Jensen: It's not right, what the police are doing. Someone has to stand up to them.

Viktor Marchenko: Is that you? Because it takes a tuto step out of line and answer back. And once you do, there is no return. Not everyone has the courage to take up the fight 

Adam Jensen: You make it sound like you're in a war. 

Viktor Marchenko: It is a war. On us, on every augmented human! You see that, don't you. There is a moment coming, and it will be soon, when all of us will have to choose a side. 
Anyone who does not will just be in the way... And that could get them killed.

Adam Jensen: I thought ARC was about preserving human rights, not advocating armed revolt. 

Viktor Marchenko: Here and now, brother, it is the same thing.
