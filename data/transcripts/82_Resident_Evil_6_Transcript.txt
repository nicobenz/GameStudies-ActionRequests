Jake/Sherry Campaign
Chapter 1
December 24, 2012
[Jake, whistling, with an apple and a syringe in his hands, is strolling through some bunker. Several soldiers stab themselves in the same syringe and turn into J’avo. But the contents of the syringe have no effect on Jake.]

Jake: This stuff do anything for you yet? Supposed to be some kind of energy booster, but I don’t feel any different. You know, between me and you, I think we should’ve asked for more money. A lot more.

[He’s being attacked by one of the J’avo. Jake’s fighting him with his bare hands.]

Jake: Pretty sure this wasn’t part of the contract… But I am willing to renegotiate.

[He beats up a zombie pretty good. Sherry runs up to him.]

Sherry: Did you take your dose?

Jake: Yeah. But if you want your own hit, you gotta sign up with the lady downstairs. Wouldn’t recommend it, though.

Sherry: No question. You’ve got the antibodies.

Jake: Thank you very much. Wait, what?

Sherry: You could be the key to saving this world, Jake Muller.

Jake: Better save myself first.

[They’re being attacked by a bunch of zombies. Sherry shoots, and Jake jumps to the ground floor. After stopping the chasers, Sherry jumps after him.]

Jake: You lose something?

Sherry: Just my balance. I’m fine.

[She pulls out her badge.]

Sherry: Sherry Birkin, the United States—

Jake: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good for you, but now’s not really the time. You coming?

Sherry: After you. Those things up there were J’avo, they’re the B.O.W.s the insurgents are using.

Jake: That explains why there’s a shitload of BSAA troops here.

Sherry: We need to get out of the country without drawing either party’s attention.

[They come out of the building... right on the battlefield. J’avo and attack helicopters, military and explosives - there’s a real war going on.]

Jake: Goddamn BSAA! What the hell are you shooting at?

Sherry: Everyone in your platoon is one of those J’avo now! And you’re dressed just like them. Come on, we have to get out of here!

Jake: Man, look at this circus. Got any popcorn?

Sherry: Stop gawking! We don’t have time!

[They find a safe place.]

Jake: All right, first things first. I want 200,000 up front, another 200 when this is over. Oh, and B.O.W.s? Those are extra. An additional grand. Each.

Sherry: I’m not here to hire you.

Jake: What? Why are you here?

Sherry: Your blood.

Jake: What are you, the Red Cross or something?

Sherry: No, listen those… things that attacked us, they were all exposed to a new virus called the C-Virus. The same strain that you just took a dose of. It didn’t affect you because you’ve got the antibodies. Right now we’re racing against a global bioterrorist attack, and we needed a vaccine yesterday. We need you, Jake. We need your blood.

Jake: 50 million dollars.

Sherry: What?

Jake: Cash. Non-negotiable. That’ll get you one pint.

[They come out of a safe place and go out to the half-destroyed part of the city on the edge of the cliff. It’s full of zombies.]

Jake: Looks like they’re expecting us. We’re gonna have to shoot our way out.

Sherry: Agreed. We don’t have a choice now.

[Jake jumps over a collapsed floor using a metal pipe sticking out of the wall.]

Jake: What are you waiting for?

Sherry: Do I look like a circus acrobat to you? I’ll find another way. Just don’t wander off too far.

Jake: Don’t worry. I ain’t running till I get my money. Whole place is falling apart. Easy does it.

Sherry: Give me a hand!

Jake: This is starting to feel like work.

Sherry: Looks like the BSAA have got their work cut out for them.

Jake: You don’t know the half of it. Last I checked my employers had a tank parked on the other side of the river. The only way the BSAA are leaving that bridge again are in bodybags.

Sherry: No. You’re wrong. They’re more resilient than you can imagine.

[Jake comes out to the crumbling concrete bridge, when a helicopter attacks him and starts firing.]

Jake: Ah what the hell, I’m not one of those ‘roided out freaks, you morons.

[He barely manages to escape and reunite with Sherry. They go out to a zombie-filled area.]

Jake: What do ya think? Fight or flight?

Sherry: There’s too many of ’em! I’m gonna go with flight!

Jake: All right, where to?

[In the distance, some monster is killing a zombie or a normal human being. Hard to say. After that, the monster attacks the heroes. They try to shoot him.]

Sherry: Let’s go! This is a waste of time!

Jake: Yeah, no shit!

[They’re running away.]

Sherry: Run!

Jake: Eat this!

[He shoots a gas cylinder and sets the monster on fire.]

Sherry: Thanks for the warning!

[But the monster doesn’t even pay attention to fire on it.]

Jake: ОК… We go with your plan. Son of a bitch, he’s strong!

Sherry: Run!

Jake: Here goes nothing!

[They jump on the scaffolding below and keep running.]

Cherry: Jake!

Jake: It’s always something with women!

[Heroes manage to get away from the creepy pursuer.]

Jake: What the hell is that thing?

Sherry: He’s tracking us. Well… technically, you.

[They go out to the warehouse.]

Sherry: Look, we can get out there!

Jake: This place looks like it’s gonna collapse too. Somebody outta call the building inspector.

Sherry: Yeah. Boy it’s even colder in here than it was outside. Dammit, they found us!

Jake: Shit, don’t these assholes have anything better to do!

[After defeating all the J’avo in the warehouse, the heroes are going to leave... but then the ceiling breaks down and the monster breaks into the room. We learn his name - Ustanak.]

Sherry: I don’t think he’s too keen on us leaving!

Jake: He’ll just have to get over it then, huh!

Sherry: You’re not taking Jake!

Jake: Hope you haven’t forgotten about my 50 million dollars.

Sherry: I’ll talk to my boss - if we make it out of here alive.

Jake: (to Ustanak) What’s wrong, asshole? Losing your nerve? Gotcha, you son of a bitch!

[After defeating Ustanak, the heroes fall to the lower floor.]

Sherry: I swear, this mission gets harder by the minute. But at least you’re still safe. We’ve got a lot riding on us.

Jake: (chuckles) Three years ago I thought I was gonna die in the jungles of South America. Enemy had us surrounded. ’Fore I knew it, everyone on my team was dead. And I’d lost my gun in the scramble. This bastard comes at me with a knife. Probably thought I wasn’t even worth the bullet.

Sherry: Why are you telling me this?

Jake: Dying on a blade is the last way you wanna go. It’s a bitch. Mercs like me? We don’t get a say in how we die. That’s just how it goes.

Sherry: It’s… kind of what you signed up for, isn’t it?

Jake: Dying for money’s one thing - that’s my choice. But dying for no good reason? That doesn’t sit right with me. ...So. You wanna tell me what that big friggin’ behemoth was, and why he’s trying to kill me?

Sherry: That thing is just like the J’avo - a bio-organic weapon created with the C-Virus. He’s being used by a terrorist organization called Neo-Umbrella.

Jake: Never heard of ’em.

Sherry: They want to study the antibodies in your blood, and they don’t care if you’re dead or alive.

Jake: I was better off as a mercenary.

Sherry: I’m not gonna let anything happen to you. The world needs you.

Jake: No no, not me. Just my blood. Well, the world can have it. Long as someone ponies up the dough.

[Soon they go out to a town where they meet several military men.]

Sherry: Sherry Birkin – National Security!

Chris: Sherry Birkin? You were in Raccoon City.

Sherry: How do you know that?

Chris: Claire.

Sherry: Wait... Are you Chris?

Chris: My sister’s told me all about you.

Piers: Chris, that man is a wanted insurgent.

Sherry: Yes, he’s a mercenary. But right now he’s under the protection of the U.S. government. He’s no threat to the BSAA.

Jake: Unless someone pays me to be.

Piers: What did you just say?

Jake: What?

Chris: Nothing.

Radio: HQ to Alpha Team. Reinforcements are unable to land due to anti-aircraft artillery. Take ’em out!

Chris: Alpha Team, copy.

Radio: What the!? We’re picking up a large bogey on radar. It’s heading right for you!

[At this point, several helicopters are bringing in huge monsters attached by ropes. The monsters have an umbilical cord on their backs, which is also attached to the helicopter. One of the monsters is dropped near the heroes.]

Chris: We’ll talk later. Right now, you need to find cover.

[The battle with the monster begins.]

Radio: Alpha Team, come in. This is Echo. Those three anti-aircraft turrets are holding us at bay.

Chris: Roger that, Echo, We’ll take care of them for you.

Soldier: Our first target’s over here!

Sherry: Chris! We’ll give you a hand!

Chris: Out of the question! You need to get to safety!

Sherry: Don’t worry about me. I can handle myself, and you need the help!

Jake: Christ... My chances of survival were higher when I was a soldier of fortune.

Soldier: I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! I need you to distract that giant B.O.W.! I can’t work with that B.O.W. around!

Sherry: Chris! We’ll take care of one of those big ones!

Jake: Thanks for volunteering me for the job, babe.

Sherry: I’m setting the charges now! Just need a little more time! The charges are set! Everyone get back!

Radio: Only two guns left!

Soldier: OK, head to the next target! I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! Just need a little more time! The charges are set! Everyone get back!

Radio: Good job, Aloha! One gun left! There’s another giant B.O.W. closing in on your location!

Piers: It’s the one we lost at the Two of Hearts!

Chris: Alpha! Prepare to engage!

Soldier: Only one to go! Everyone into that underground passage! I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! Just need a little more time! I need you to distract that giant B.O.W.! I can’t work with that B.O.W. around! I’m setting the charges now! The charges are set! Everyone get back!

Radio: All anti-aircraft guns have been silenced, Nice work, Alpha. But you’re not out of the woods yet. Echo Team can’t land until you take care of that other B.O.W. We’ll try to hit it from the air. See if it has any weaknesses.

Chris: Targeting those exposed organs! Fire at will!

[Jake and Chris’ squad defeat two giant B.O.W.]

Radio: Good work out there, Alpha! Echo Team will be landing shortly.

Chris: I already gave the pilot the coordinates.

Sherry: Thank you so much for your help.

Chris: (to Jake) Hey... Hey! Have we met?

Jake: You jarheads all look the same to me pal, sorry.

[Piers wants to punch him in the face, but Chris stops him.]

Piers: You’ve gotta be kidding me!

Chris: My mistake. Have a safe flight.

[Jake and Sherry are leaving in a helicopter. Sherry calls her superiors on the way.]

Sherry: Yes… but there’s something I need to run by you. Mr. Muller is requesting compensation for his cooperation... 50 million dollars. Yes. Yes, I understand. I’ll let him know.

Jake: So, we got a deal?

Sherry: Yes, we have a deal.

Jake: That was easy. By the way, that guy that you were all chummy with back there...

Sherry: You mean Chris?

Jake: That’s the one.

Sherry: What about him?

Jake: Forget it.

[The helicopter’s starting to shake.]

Sherry: What was that?

Jake: My gut’s goin’ with something bad. And here it comes.

[Ustanak bursts into the helicopter, rips out the door.]

Sherry: Oh my God.

Jake: That thing doesn’t give up.

Sherry: We have to shoot him off or he’ll bring us down!

Jake: I’m getting 50 million. I don’t mind working for it a little. This thing is after you two, ain’t he!

Sherry: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to put you in danger!

Jake: Don’t sweat it, kid! This is why I get paid the big bucks!

Pilot: Jump to the next chopper! Move! Now! What are you waiting for?

[Sherry has no problem jumping on another helicopter. Jake’s luck is less - when he jumps his helicopter explodes and Jake hangs on the edge of another helicopter.]

Cherry: Jake!

[Meanwhile, Ustanak hanging from one hand raises a huge machine gun.]

Jake: This just gets better and better. He’s locked on to us! This is getting a little crazy. Even for me!

Sherry: e can’t take any more hits! We ve gotta shoot the missiles down!

Jake: I should’ve read the line print before signing up for this. Get your own helicopter, asshole!

Sherry: Look, parachutes!

Chapter 2
[Jake wakes up lying on the snow-covered ground. He notices the blood on his arm and realizes it’s not his blood, it’s Sherry’s. There’s a huge piece of iron sticking out of her back.]

Jake: What do I do?

Sherry: Pull it out...

Jake: No! You’ll bleed to death.

Sherry: Please...

Jake: Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

[He pulls out the fragment and the wound immediately heals itself.]

Jake: What the hell! You wanna tell me what the hell just happened?

Sherry: Long story.

Jake: Yeah? Maybe it’s your blood they should be testing for vaccines.

Sherry: They already did. More than I could stand.

[She starts snooping around looking for her stuff.]

Jake: What are you doing?

Sherry: The data’s gone!

Jake: What data?

Sherry: Your data! Your blood analysis, your genome, everything that we need to make a vaccine.

Jake: No! You mean everything I need to get my 50 million. Well, come on super girl, let’s get lookin’.

[They go in search of data mediums in the snowy forest.]

Sherry: I had all your intel saved on a handful of data chips. We’ve gotta find them!

Jake: In the middle of a snowstorm? You really want me to work for that money, don’t you? Hey, look. There’s a shack up there. Finally, a little luck...

Sherry: OK, first we find the data, then we’ll take shelter there.

Sherry: So this data you need to find. It’s about me, isn’t it?

Sherry: There are three data chips. I lost them in the crash. The locator will pinpoint each one’s position.

Jake: OK... We find your gear, and then I brew us up a nice, hot pot ’a coffee. Jesus... What are these nasty-looking things?

Sherry: They’re J’avo, and they’re encased in a… cocoon. When they hatch… well… it isn’t pretty.

Jake: I’m so glad I was immune to that shit, they gave us. I’d rather be in there, kicking my feet, up, then out here on this stupid scavenger hunt. I must’ve pissed somebody off upstairs.

Sherry: I sure could use a break about now... But finding that data is priority one.

Jake: So this little thing is chock full ’a data on me, huh. Two left. We’d better hurry before I freeze my ass off. Found another one. Doesn’t look, broken... OK. One more to go. And I bet you’ll be a real pain in the ass to find... Gotcha. Is that it for the data chips?

Sherry: Yeah, thanks for the help. Now let’s get out of this cold.

[Having collected all the flash drives, the heroes go to the forest hut. A real snowstorm is raging outside the window. They make a fire and for a while just sit there doing nothing. But Jake can’t just sit there doing nothing. He jumps off the table there he sit and goes to the exit.]

Sherry: I’ll go get help. It can’t be that much further to the rendezvous.

Jake: Wait!

[She opens the door and is knocked down by the blowing wind. Jake can barely close the door. They sit by the burning fireplace.]

Jake: So... You always been like that? The whole "healing" thing.

Sherry: My dad was a scientist. He was working on B.O.W.s when I was exposed. Luckily, I was treated with the vaccine before it was too late, but the virus adjusted and adapted. It’s been a part of me ever since.

Jake: What happened to your father?

Sherry: His research killed him. By the time he died his body had mutated so much… he wasn’t even recognizable.

Jake: Sorry. I didn’t mean to...

Sherry: That’s all right. Besides, I didn’t walk out of it empty handed.

Jake: Yeah, you got super powers.

Sherry: That’s not what I meant. The people who saved me, Leon and Claire, are the closest friends I’ve ever had.

Jake: Claire is that BSAA guy’s sister, right?

Sherry: They risked their lives for me back in Raccoon City. I guess I’m still just trying to live up to their example—never giving up no matter the odds.

[Jake looks at her and then he jumps to her, covering with his body. There are a few bullets flying over their heads.]

Jake: Speaking of odds... Looks like we got some party crashers. But this cabin’s invitation only.

[They fight back the attacking mercenaries/zombies.]

Sherry: We’re surrounded! It’s an avalanche! Let’s get out of here!

Jake: I told them to keep the noise down!

[They get on snowmobiles.]

Jake: Punch it, before, we get buried alive! The whole mountain’s coming down! God must really hate us today!

Sherry: We’ll make it, just keep going! Anyway... I don’t hate you!

Jake: Oh great. That helps!

Sherry: Oh, no! Go right!

Jake: Keep your speed up! I don’t want to be buried out here! This is not a good idea!

Sherry: Too late now!

Jake: Jump!

[They jump from snowmobiles to a small cave. Once inside, they find the entrance blocked with rocks.]

Sherry: Are you OK?

Jake: Don’t worry about me. I’m built like a tank.

Sherry: Fine. I won’t. Let’s go.

Jake: Wow, nice acoustics... Watch your step.

Sherry: I wonder how deep this mine goes.

[The cave looks like a bunker. As they move on, they discover... Ustanak. A poor mercenary comes into his lair. The muscular monster uses his bats to notice him and turn him into mincemeat.]

Jake: Jesus Christ! What does it take to kill that thing!

Sherry: I think he’s using those bugs to sniff us out. Be careful.

Jake: Shit! He found us!

Sherry: Quick, hide! Watch out for those bugs. If they find us...

Jake: Yeah, yeah, I know. Tall, dark, and ugly’ll come tear us apart.

Sherry: He’s found us!

Jake: Hide before he comes! When’s it our turn to chase him?

Sherry: He’ll kill us if he finds us.

Jake: Thanks for the news flash. Shit! He found us!

Sherry: Quick, hide!

Jake: I’m not really a fan of hide and seek.

Sherry: Oh, you’d rather that thing kill you?

Jake: Shit! He found us!

Sherry: Quick, hide! Keep your hands to yourself!

Jake: Hey, you’re the one rubbing up on me. Besides, what makes you think you’re my type?

Sherry: I would shoot you if I didn’t need you alive.

Jake: Seriously!? Geez, this guy doesn’t miss a beat!

Sherry: He sure can move fast for something that size.

Jake: Shit! He found us!

Sherry: Quick, hide!

Jake: Get the hell outta here, for Chrissakes! Shit! He found us!

Sherry: Quick, hide!

Jake: I hate this hiding bullshit.

Sherry: That was close.

Jake: Aw shit... Run!

[They stumble into a locked door. They need a key card that... is in the hand of a corpse lying next to Ustanak.]

Sherry: We can’t go anywhere without that key.

Jake: Then let’s go get it.

[He’s planting several bombs to distract the monster.]

Jake: Ha-ha! Whadya think of that, sucker!

Sherry: Quiet! He ’ll hear you!

[They take the card quickly and open the door. Ustanak runs after them.]

Jake: Christ, he’s like a sales rep that won’t take no for an answer!

[In the next room, they find... a drilling machine.]

Sherry: I think this will stop him!

Jake: Oh, this is gonna be fun! Not so tough now, are ya!?

Sherry: We got him now! We did it. We beat him.

Jake: Just barely. Is that the exit?

Sherry: Yeah, once we get out there, I’ll radio for pickup. My team should be close by. That’s the rendezvous.

Jake: About damn time.

[However, they are attacked by a whole crowd of zombie mercenaries, and then the resurrected Ustanak comes out. He punches the heroes with his metal hand.]

Jake: Come on super girl.

[Ustanak presses Jake with his boot to the snow-covered ground. Ada approaches him with a group of zombie mercenaries.]

Jake: You know, those shots of yours pack one hell of a punch, lady.

Ada: So, you’re Wesker Junior.

Jake: Wesker? You lost me.

Ada: Albert Wesker was a colossal imbecile, a fool who tried to destroy the world. He was also your father.

Jake: What!?

Ada: Which makes you heir to a very special blood type.

[She nods to Ustanak and he knocks Jake out with a powerful boot punch.]

Chapter 3
[Jake is put in futuristic cell in some lab. A few masked mercenaries come up to him and take him out.]

Mercenary: (in Chinese) “Keep moving.”

Jake: (in Chinese) “Sorry guys, time to move on.”

[He beats up mercenaries using some kind of snake hand-to-hand combat style. Meanwhile, Sherry also manages to get out of the room where she’s kept using an electric baton.]

Jake: I don’t need a weapon to kill assholes like you! Goodbye, shitty prison cell. It’s been a real slice of heaven.

Loudspeaker: Two test subjects have escaped from their quarters. They must not leave the facility. Permission to use firearms has been granted. Repeat Two test Subjects have escaped from their quarters. They must not leave the facility. Permission to use firearms has been granted.

Jake: I knew she was here! I’m coming for you, Sherry.

[They meet in the locker room. Sherry notices she’s wearing nothing but hospital clothes, so she hides behind the locker door. Jake decides to wear something, too.]

Sherry: Jake! Where are we?

Jake: China.

Sherry: Obviously, but where? Why?

Jake: Don’t know, don’t care.

[He notices Sherry taking off her hospital clothes, gettingcompletely naked and for a second losing touch with reality.]

Jake: I just know I am done being their guinea pig.

Sherry: What did they do to you?

Jake: Plenty. They said something about using my antibody to enhance the C-Virus.

Sherry: What else did they say?

Jake: You know anything about an Albert Wesker?

Sherry: What?

Jake: I’ll take that as a yes. They talked about him. A lot. I guess he had an antibody that could fight off any virus. Apparently, he abused his gift, took it for granted, and then ended up turning himself into a some kind of monster. And here I thought dear old dad was just a deadbeat who skipped out on us no, no, no... he was actually... a freakin’ nut job who almost destroyed the world!

Sherry: Your father’s actions have nothing to do with you.

Jake: Yeah, but his blood does. It’s the whole reason why we’re even here. I mean, come on! You really think that crazy doesn’t run in the family? That nothing of who my father was didn’t somehow get passed on down to me? You of all people should know that’s true. I’m just sayin’... The man that I am, the things that I’ve done at least it all makes a little bit more sense now. What?

Sherry: You can blame your father all you want. But at some point you have to take responsibility for your own actions. I have to let my superiors know I’m OK. But first we need a way to contact them.

[They’re walking through lab corridors fighting zombie mercenaries. Jake finds an ID Medal.]

Jake: Hm? What the hell’s this?

[When they go out into the main hall, Jake is struck by the richness of the building’s decoration - marble, gold and artfully crafted statues everywhere.]

Jake: I’ll tell you this, it took a lot of money to build something this big.

Sherry: No kidding. I never saw anything outside of the one crappy room they had me in.

Jake: Hey, look. We can get out here.

Sherry: Yeah. But until I talk to my superiors, I don’t even know where to go.

Jake: Why does everything have to be a such pain in the ass? All right. Guess we better find a way for you to phone home.

[Jake reads the inscription on the statue.]

Jake: Three medallions for the west. And it says it takes ten medallions to gain passage to the east. OK, we know what they look like. Now we find the rest. So, what’d they have you doing for the past six months?

Sherry: You name it. They were trying to research the virus I’m carrying. It was the same thing I went through after Raccoon City. And it was just as shitty the second time.

Jake: Jeez. I’m sorry.

[They keep collecting medals. In order to get one of them, Jake even has to play Frédéric Chopin’s Étude Op. 10, No. 12, better known as Revolutionary Étude. Once they’ve collected everything they need, they go into a secret room.]

Jake: What is this?

Sherry: Data from your experiments. Here we go.

[While Sherry’s on the computer, Jake finds a cell phone.]

Jake: Hello!

Sherry: It’s all right here.

Jake: Why don’t you call your boss?

Sherry: It’s me, Sherry Birkin... Yes, he’s OK. We were detained… at a facility in China. Really!? All right, I’ll send you our exact coordinates. (to Jake) They’re already here in China! It’s over, we’re saved.

Jake: Hallelujah. So, you ready?

Sherry: Done. Now let’s get the hell outta here.

Jake: Let’s go! These guys aren’t much for conversation.

Sherry: Good. I was sick of this place anyway.

[However, the mercenaries also get tired of playing games and they come into the building... in a tank.]

Jake: Are you kidding me!?

Sherry: Oh crap! Run!

[The tank begins to stop the germs by demolishing walls and furniture.]

Jake: Jesus Christ! Oh, come on! Enough already! How the hell do I get over there? I could swing off that statue if I got it to the right angle. Haha! That works! Let’s try it again. I hope you break your stupid statue! Thanks for the opening! Sherry! I found a bike! Just hold on!

Sherry: OK!

[Jake’s going out one-on-one with the tank. They ride on each other, but at the last moment Jake dodges a shot from the tank’s main gun, jumps on the highway and drives away.]

Chapter 4
[While Jake is on the night highway, Sherry’s on the phone with his boss.]

Sherry: Yes… we’re all right. Understood. I’ll make sure.. We’ll be there soon.

Jake: What did he say?

Sherry: He gave me the rendezvous coordinates. It’s close.

[They’ll be followed by a helicopter.]

Jake: Great. Hang on!

Sherry: They’re trying to mow us down!

Jake: Yeah, thanks, I have ears! God only knows how we’re gonna get out of this! Hold on to me!

[He jumps off the highway into town from a building height.]

Sherry: Oh my God... Jake!

Jake: This city is going to hell in a handbasket.

[Zombies on motorcycles are starting to follow them.]

Jake: Hey! Shoot that thing, would ya!

Sherry: This is really starting to hurt.

Jake: Next time I’ll steal a limo! Hold on as tight as you can, OK?

[Jake’s driving through the woods close to a helicopter. An unexpected explosion throws Sherry away and she clings to the helicopter.]

Sherry: Jake!

Jake: Son of a… Goddamn it!

Sherry: I can’t hold on!

Jake: Yes you can! I’m coming!

[Jake accelerates, drives into the scaffolding and grabs Sherry.]

Jake: You OK?

Sherry: Yeah. Nice catch. The helicopter’s back!

Jake: Bastard was waiting for us. Hang on!

Sherry: They’re still on us!

[The helicopter shoots a passing loader and the cars in its body start to roll out on the road.]

Jake: As if we didn’t have enough problems! Watch out! Here we go! Hold on!

[Jake dodges the cars and uses the loader as a springboard. He jumps the helicopter, and on the ground he jumps off the motorcycle. It crashes into a wall and explodes.]

Jake: You all right?

Sherry: I’m fine.

[Jake and Sherry enter a small courtyard with scaffolding around its perimeter. Jake sees Chris’s squad at the top.]

Jake: Come on. Shit. Looks like Redfield and his boyscouts are here, too.

Sherry: Jake! Chris’ team will protect us.

Jake: We don’t need their help. I didn’t ask for it either.

Sherry: I know you don’t like him, but if Chris is here...

Jake: All right, all right! Enough about Redfield! Geez, it’s getting old! These guys don’t know who they’re dealing with. Time to clue ’em in. Droppin’ like flies. We’ll have this mess mopped up in no time.

Sherry: Jake! He’s the last one!

Jake: Hmph, and I thought we’d be here all night. This way!

Sherry: OK.

Jake: Screw all this running. I’m taking that, chopper out.

Sherry: How? With what?

Jake: Not sure. Kinda making this up as I go!

Sherry: Chris is on the roof trying to take that chopper down.

Jake: Not goin’ too well for him, is it? Wanna show him how it’s done?

Sherry: Well, I have some explosive rounds that could even the odds.

[Jake’s clinging to the rope that was used to by grasshopper zombie to descend from the helicopter.]

Sherry: Jake! No! You’ll be killed!

Jake: You know what they say about desperate times! Watch and learn!

[He’s climbing to the helicopter.]

Jake: You’re going down!

[He kills the pilot and the veto crashes. Jake jumps on the ground with Sherry without much trouble. He exchanges a stare with Chris.]

Sherry: Come on, let’s go. Our orders are to avoid contact with anyone.

Jake: Does he know that Wesker was my father?

Sherry: I don’t think so. Why?

Jake: No reason. Maybe I just rubbed him the wrong way.

[They enter the building.]

Jake: Did you even see the kind of helicopter they sent after us? A bird like that costs around fifteen million dollars. Man, terrorism is lucrative.

Sherry: Maybe they have an oil baron or two in their pocket.

Jake: Oil Barons? In the country I was born in, people think Uncle Sam causes most of the problems in this world.

Sherry: Yeah, sure, everyone loves to blame America for everything. We’re not the bad guy, Jake. Look, these terrorists have unleashed bioweapons on our country, too!

Jake: So the whole world’s going to hell.

Sherry: And you’re the only one who can save it.

Jake: Well, shit. As long as there’s no pressure, right? Man, everywhere you look, there’s more of these assholes. Sucks being so popular.

Sherry: There’s no sneaking around them, is there?

[They come to a door locked on the other side.]

Jake: It’s bolted shut? Ah, fuck me… Come on, we gotta figure out a way to get this thing open. Sherry, it’s open! Smells like death. Just like Edonia.

[Jake goes to the scaffolding, and Sherry follows him. One of the beams in the scaffolding can’t hold up and Jake falls to the asphalt, knocking over some of the stretched canopies with his body.]

Sherry: Jake! Are you OK?

Jake: I’ve taken bigger spills. Course, I don’t have that healing factor of yours.

Sherry: Too bad the fall didn’t knock the wise ass out of you. This one’s bolted shut too.

Jake: Another one? All right, here we go again,

Sherry: It’s open — c’mon!

[They’re coming into the bus-blocked area. You can smell gasoline everywhere. From somewhere above, a monster jumps onto the heroes, whose hand is attached to a chainsaw so that it seems like an extension of his hand. The monster chirps his chainsaw on the asphalt and the area around the heroes lights up.]

Sherry: Don’t get too close! You’ll be ripped to shreds!

Jake: Yeah, thanks. I know what a chainsaw can do!

Jake: Now’s our chance! He’s all yours! Take that, you piece of shit! Did that do it?

Sherry: I think he’s down.

[They get out of the fiery hell and see a falling plane.]

Sherry: It’s American...!

[She runs to the crash site and sees a familiar face.]

Sherry: Is that… Leon?

Leon: Sherry? What are you doing here?

Sherry: I’m on protective detail.

Leon: Yeah, I heard you became an agent.

Sherry: Why are you here?

Leon: I’m tracking the man behind all this. Chief Security Advisor Simmons.

Sherry: What!? There must be some sort of mistake. I report to Simmons!

Leon: He’s your supervisor?

Sherry: We’re on our way to meet with him right now.

Leon: Where is he! I need to know—

[He tries to get close, but Jake pushes him aside.]

Jake: Hey!

Sherry: Jake! Let me handle this.

Jake: I thought your orders were to avoid contact… with anyone.

Sherry: Leon’s not just anyone. He saved my life back in Raccoon City.

Jake: Fair enough.

[Behind them, standing on a container, a sinister figure spreads his back.]

Helena: Look out!

[Ustanak throws a turbine at Sherry. Only Jake, using his incredible speed, manages to save her. The turbine can explode, cutting off the heroes’ escape route.]

Helena: Leon, the plane!

[The heroes notice Ustanak.]

Jake: Him again!?

Leon: Friend of yours?

Jake: More like an ex-girlfriend. Guy doesn’t know when to quit.

Leon: Welcome to the club. You get used to it.

[A massive and epic battle ensues. Four trained soldiers against a virtually immortal killing machine.]

Sherry: Watch out for his arm!

Leon: Got it!

Helena: Now’s our chance. Let’s go! You’ve fought this thing before and you’re still breathing? I’m impressed.

Jake: Are you kidding? I get a kick outta this.

Helena: You’re not entirely sane, are you? How is he still standing!?

Sherry: Don’t get me started! But maybe the four of us can stop him once and for all!

[Ustanak changes his mechanical arm.]

Leon: He carries around a spare?

Helena: Give him credit — at least he came prepared.

Jake: Like I said... Indestructible.

Leon: I was hoping you were exaggerating.

Jake: ‘Fraid not. That doesn’t mean we gotta, make things easy for him.

Leon: Hey, shit for brains! Over here!

[Using tactics rather than brute force, heroes manage to weaken a powerful enemy. The electric tower, damaged during the fight, falls on Ustanak’s head, and the heroes manage to jump away in different directions - though this separates them again.]

Leon: Sherry!

Sherry: Leon! We’re gonna head to the Kwun Lung Building over in Koocheng! That is where I’m meeting with Simmons!

Leon: Sherry, listen! Until we get there, I need you to—

[The tower explodes silencing Leon’s words.]

Jake: Hey! If he is half the man you say he is, he’ll be fine. OK?

Sherry: You’re right. We should hurry.

[They move on.]

Sherry: Koocheng is up ahead, at the mouth of the river.

Jake: All right. Come on. You’re worried about Simmons, right?

[Sherry nods.]

Jake: You’re gonna be fine, OK?

[Suddenly the zombie with the chainsaw finds them. Jake grabs Sherry’s hand and they run away.]

Jake: Let’s go!

[Someone with a sniper rifle in her hands shoot the zombie.]

Jake: Was that you?

[Jake and Sherry leave on a raft. After a few minutes, the zombie with the chainsaw comes to life.]

Jake: Jesus Christ!

Sherry: Watch out! This day is never gonna end, is it?

[They moor the raft at the floating restaurant.]

Sherry: Come on!

Jakes: (encounters the zombie) He’s back! This prick won’t give up!

[The unknown sniper shoots again.]

Sherry: Watch out! Someone’s shooting at us!

Jake: They’re not shooting at us they’re helping us! Maybe it’s your buddies in the BSAA!

[The zombie loses his balance from the shot and falls on the billboard, which electrocutes him. Once well fried, he falls into the water to cool off.]

Sherry: I think he’s dead.

Jake: Let’s hope it sticks. Found us another boat!

[They board a new raft.]

Sherry: I just saw some sort of light or something in the water.

Jake: (stirring away from the falling poles) Jesus Christ!

[The zombie jumps on the raft. The heroes start shooting. The sniper helps too.]

Jake: Oh, come on! Really!?

[After a brief skirmish, the sniper shoots at the mount of the iron beam above their heads and the lowered end knocks the zombies off the raft.]

Jake: What the hell was that?

Sherry: I don’t know, but whoever they are, they just saved my life.

Jake: Worst boat ride since the Titanic.

[But the zombie has no intention of giving up! When our heroes’ raft docks and Jake steps ashore, he jumps out of the water. Sherry and the zombie end up on the raft. Jake stays on the shore.]

Jake: Shit! Sherry!

Sherry: Jake!

[In the end, the zombie is chopped to pieces by the blades of a fallen helicopter. Jake catches the blown away Sherry. The unknown sniper flies away on a cable into the distance without showing us her face. Someone calls Sherry on the phone.]

Sherry: Yes? Almost. All right, we’ll be there as soon as we can.

Jake: Boss still keeping tabs on you, huh?

Sherry: ...For now.

Jake: Let’s go then.

[They leave the dock and go to their objective - meeting Simmons. Before they walk through the door, Sherry turns to Jake.]

Sherry: If Leon was right about Simmons, I want you to run. (Jake scoffs) No matter what happens. Promise me.

Jake: Fine.

[They enter the warehouse... where the confrontation between Leon, Helena and Simmons is already simmering.]

Sherry: No! Wait!

Simmons: Ah, Agent Birkin. Impeccable timing. Kindly take these two into custody, won’t you?

Sherry: They said you were involved in the terrorist attack. Is it true?

Simmons: What, are they running down the streets, screaming it to anyone who’ll listen?

Sherry: Answer me!

Simmons: It’s for the benefit of the United States—and global security.

Leon: I can’t see how killing the president is good for the country.

Sherry: The president’s dead?

Simmons: Well, we have Leon to thank for that.

Helena: God damn you, Simmons!

Simmons: (to his men) Dispose of them.

[The shootout begins.]

Sherry: No!

[Jake saves her from being shot on the spot.]

Simmons: Hold your fire! Those two are still of use to us.

Leon: (to Sherry) You need to be more careful.

Jake: All right, all right, so what’s the plan, hero?

Leon: You think you can make it to that door?

Jake: Why don’t we just waste them?

Leon: Because I need you to take care of Sherry.

Simmons: Can we wrap this up? I do have better things to do.

Sherry: What are you two gonna do?

Helena: Finish Simmons.

Sherry: (hands Leon a flash drive) There’s information on here that could stop the C-Virus. Simmons wants it.

Leon: Thanks. I’ll put a call in to FOS, get you some protection. Now move!

[While Leon and Helena create a distraction, Jake and Sherry head for the door, but are immediately surrounded by the infected.]

Sherry: Go! Run!

Jake: Not a chance.

Sherry: You promised!

Jake: I lied.

[They begin to fight a multitude of mutated zombies. The odds are stacked against the heroes. One of the zombies grabs Sherry with his huge hand and drag away.]

Sherry: Jake!

Jake: Sherry!

[He tries to break through the crowd of zombies.]

Sherry: Jake!

Jake: Sherry!

[But he fails. They both get captured.]

Chapter 5
[Jake wakes up cuffed to some machine in an underground laboratory. Sherry is cuffed next to him.]

Sherry: I’m sorry. I trusted Simmons. I should’ve been able to see through his lies. This is all my fault.

Jake: You were just following orders, right? I thought you were doing the right thing. Find the vaccine, save the world and all that.

[An alarm goes on. The cuffs on the mechanism opens.]

Jake: What the hell just happened?

Sherry: Ugh, of course. They took our weapons.

Jake: (looking at a nearby room) Hey! There’s our gear.

Sherry: How do we get in there?

[They use the ventilation shaft.]

Jake: Good luck.

Sherry: Thanks.

[Sherry has to fight some zombies on her own to open the door.]

Jake: Sherry!

Sherry: I’m all right!

Jake: You sure, ’cause you don’t look all right. Hey, break down the door! Save me from climbin’ through those air ducts.

[Sherry knocks out the door and returns Jake’s gear. He shoots the zombies.]

Jake: Not bad, for a girl.

Sherry: ...My pleasure.

[Soon they find a room with an elevator and a computer attached to it.]

Computer: Electricity temporarily rerouted to incubation chamber. To activate elevator, please attach reserve battery.

Sherry: Reserve battery?

Jake: Where the hell is it?

Sherry: Won’t know ’till we find it.

[They find the first battery.]

Computer: Reserve battery 1 activated. 25% Charged.

Jake: We gotta get more? Dammit!

[With some elevator acrobatics they find the second battery.]

Jake: Huh, it’s hardly practical, but we got no choice. Really, there’s no other way up? ...Oh well.

Computer: Reserve battery 2 activated. 50% Charged.

Jake: All right, half way there.

Computer: Reserve battery 3 activated. 75% Charged.

Jake: One more left.

[The last zombie attacking Jake is fried on the electric fence and accidentally falls on the battery lever. The power system is overloaded.]

Computer: Unexpected power surge detected. Please use elevator for evacuation.

Jake: What the hell! First there’s no power, now there’s too much?

Sherry: At least the elevator works!

[She sees a rampaging giant machine that they used to move around different areas and activate the batteries.]

Sherry: We have to find a way to stop this.

Jake: That crane might do the trick!

[He runs up to the crane control and lowers it. The frantic machine collides with the crane and collapses. Jake and Sherry climb onto the machine, but the zombies don’t come after them!]

Jake: I’m fresh out of patience, pal!

[While the heroes are fighting, the machine manages to break the crane. The top half of the platform drops sharply, causing the heroes to fall and cling to the edge. They climb to the other half of the platform. They have to crawl through quickly before the upper part crushes them.]

Jake: Sherry! You all right?

Sherry: Yeah, I’m fine! Hurry!

Jake: Jump!

[They successfully jump to the floor with the elevator, and the zombie is crushed by the two halves of the machine. Jake and Sherry activate the elevator and descend into the lower area of the lab, where they meet Chris and Piers.]

Sherry: Chris!

Chris: Glad to see you’re OK.

Sherry: Wait, was that you who just freed us?

Jake: Looks like you guys saved the day again.

Chris: (to Jake) I can see your father in you.

Sherry: How did you know where—

Jake: Wait, hold on a second. So you knew him?

Chris: Yeah. I did. And I’m the one that killed him.

Jake: (swiftly pulls out a pistol) It was you?

Chris: That’s right.

Piers: (aiming at Jake) Chris!

Jake: You better put a leash on that puppy.

Chris: (waves Piers) This is between me and him. (to Jake) Go ahead, shoot. You have every right to. Just promise me you’ll survive. The world depends on it.

Jake: (angerly) Who the hell are you to tell me what to do!?

Sherry: Stop it!

Piers: Put your gun down! Now!

Jake: Tell me, were you just... ...following orders, or was it personal?

Chris: Both.

Sherry: Jake, please, stop!

Piers: ...before I put a bullet in your head! Just put your gun down.

Sherry: Don’t do this!

[Jake screams and pulls the trigger. He leaves a scratch on Chris’ cheek.]

Jake: There are more important things at stake than you and me.

[The lab is beginning to collapse.]

Piers: We gotta go!

Sherry: Jake!

Jake: I know!

[He stops kissing Chris. The heroes look up and see a huge monster chained to the ceiling.]

Sherry: Guys! I think this is some sort of lift! There’s one over there, too! Let’s get outta here.

Computer: "HAOS Release Simulation" ”Infection Rate 20%... 60%..." "Infection Rate 100%"

Jake: What the hell is this?

Piers: The end of the world.

Chris: Unless we stop it.

Sherry: So if that giant cocoon hatches...

Chris: ...We’re in trouble.

Piers: Just a bit. We gotta get outta here and warn HQ!

Chris: This way!

Sherry: Gimme a hand!

[All four heroes are taking a giant elevator up to the cocoon.]

Jake: Just so we’re clear, you and I are not done talking yet. You’ve got a lot of explaining to do.

Chris: We make it outta here alive, and I’ll tell you whatever you want. I just hope you’re ready to hear it.

Jake: Save the bullshit. I’m not the same man my father was. But if it ever comes down to you and me, it’ll be me, got it?

Chris: Loud and clear.


Piers: (to Sherry) Your friend’s a little unpredictable, isn’t he? Must make it hard to rely on him. Not that the Captain’s been a walk in the park lately.

Sherry: No one’s perfect, but I trust him. Anyway, all we can do right now is focus on getting out of here.

Piers: Good point.

[They slowly move up and fight zombies. As the elevator approaches the cocoon, it begins to open. A man-dominated monster with long arms bursts out of the cocoon. Upon noticing the heroes, the monster strikes the elevator with its wide arm.]

Chris: Look out!

[The heroes are separated. Not being able to withstand the weight of the monster, the stick, on which the cocoon weighs, breaks. The monster falls down, breaking the ladders.]

Sherry: Chris!

Chris: Get moving! We got it from here.

Jake: Let’s go.

Sherry: Wait!

Jake: You’ve got a job to finish.

[They run in through the closing door.]

Sherry: There is no way they can take that thing!

Jake: We are not going back.

Sherry: But they’re gonna get killed!

Jake: Then that’s their choice! It’s a sacrifice they’re willing to make, and we can’t stop them.

Sherry: Jake…

Jake: You know what? I’m not my father. And I’m gonna make damn sure that it stays that way. We’re getting outta here... ...and you’re gonna save the world.

Sherry: You’re right. Let’s go.

[They run through underwater facility corridors.]

Jake: I’m through with this, where’s the exit?

Sherry: We’ve gotta be close.

[They lead out to a vast room of lava, over which bridges are strung. When Jake and Sherry jump onto the bridges, Ustanak comes out to them.]

Jake: Well, look who’s back.

[Now a metal ball on a chain is attached to Ustanak’s arm, which he waves and destroys the pipes, blocking the way for the heroes to escape.]

Jake: Enough of this cat and mouse bullshit. Come get some, you ugly son of a bitch!

[The fight begins.]

Jake: Sherry, we gotta take this fight somewhere else!

Sherry: Let’s do it! (sees Ustanak) Oh, crap!

Jake: Just keeps on uppin’ his game! Nice hit, Sherry!

[Ustanak destroys the bridge and Jake falls to a platform below.]

Jake: Yeah, this is much better! Yeah, make more lava holes, you freakin’ idiot!

Sherry: He doesn’t care. He’ll do whatever it takes to kill us! Jake! Go for it! Now!

[Jake attacks Ustanak and rips out his ball and chain with his bare hands. Ustanak pushes Sherry and she falls on the ruined bridge, losing her gun. Jake is left alone with the huge monster.]

Jake: This is more like it! Let’s settle this mano a mano!

[They start fighting on their fists.]

Jake: Is that all you got?

Sherry: I’ll cover you!

Jake: Thanks! (to Ustanak) Gotta be quicker than that! Ha-ha! Missed me! Gotta say… I was expecting more! Gotta be quicker than that!

[He punches Ustanak to the lava.]

Jake: Good riddance.

[The facility is beginning to fall apart.]

Jake: Let’s get outta here!

Sherry: We finally killed him.

Jake: ...Piece of cake. We’re in some kind of warehouse. There’s gotta be a way to move shit in and out!

Sherry: Right.

[They climb onto the platform in the turbotunnel and activate it. It carries the heroes away at breakneck speed.]

Sherry: (barely hanging on) Whoa, this is fast!

Jake: Yeah, and there’s no goddamn steering.

[However... the burning Ustanak continues the pursuit on another platform. He jumps onto the platform of the heroes. They try to crawl away from him.]

Jake: Christ almighty! What does it take to lose this guy!?

Sherry: Come on! We have to move further up.

Jake: Jesus, take the hint!

Sherry: Jake, keep going!

Jake: Hey! Check out the cargo! You thinking what I’m thinking?

Sherry: I am now! Come on!

[They lose the cargo.]

Jake: Take that, asshole!

[Jake loses another cargo.]

Sherry: Enough already! You’re not getting him!

Jake: One more for you, you sack of shit!

[But Ustanak continues his pursuit.]

Jake: Ah, fuck.

Sherry: Jake! Look! A gun!

Jake: Well, what are we waiting for?

[Sherry grabs the revolver, which is difficult to hold with one hand because the other is holding on to the platform so as not to fly away. Jake grabs her hand and helps her hold the gun.]

Jake: This shit ends now!

[Together they shoot Ustanak right through the heart and he dies. His corpse is thrown aside, barely missing the heroes.]

Jake: You saved me... You know that, don’t you? Thank you.

[They hold hands and the screen fades into white. In the next scene, we see Sherry flying on an airplane. She is reflecting on the events and their consequences.]

Sherry: (offscreen) Jake Wesker’s blood sample was handed over to the UN’s leading researchers, along with 6 months worth of test results retrieved from Neo-Umbrella’s archives. With the data now in the right hands, things seem to be finally settling down. Following Jake’s rescue, BSAA officials classified his relationship to Albert Wesker as top secret, recognizing the threat it could pose to global security.

[Sherry closes her laptop and drinks some tea. Suddenly she got a text from Jake.]

Jake: “I lowered my asking price… to 50 dollars.”

[Sherry smiles. Meanwhile, Jake watches a plane fly by. He puts on his black glasses, starts his bike, and rides off into the sunset.]

THE END

Chris/Piers Campaign
Chapter 1
June 29, 2013
Eastern Europe

[Chris is sitting in some dirty bar. Apparently he’s been sitting for quite some time now because he looks pretty drunk. ]

Chris: Another round!

[The bartender raises her eyebrows and takes care of the bottle. Next to Chris stands Piers and eats a steak with side dish.]

Piers: Hard to find a good steak around here. Not like back home.

[The bartender comes back with a bottle and pours Chris half a glass.]

Chris: Fill her up!

Bartender: You’ve had enough.

[Chris is taking the bottle out of her hands.]

Chris: Listen, sweetheart. You’re here to pour drinks and look pretty, so how about you shut your mouth?

[The bartender pulls the glass out of his hands and pours the drink in his face.]

Bartender: How about you get the hell out of my bar?

Chris: Nowhere to go.

Bouncer [in Serbian]: Éj! Dama vas zamolila da odete. / “The lady asked you to leave.”

[Chris walks past him. The bouncer grabs his shoulder.]

Bouncer: I said the she asked you to leave!

[Chris throws him to the table and picks up a bottle to hit the bouncer, but Piers stops him.]

Piers: Never thought I’d find Chris Redfield wasting away in a shithole like this.

Chris: Who the hell are you?

Piers: Piers... Piers Nivans.

Chris: Never heard o ‘ya.

Piers: How ‘bout this? You heard of this?

[He shows him his phone with a blurred picture of either an explosion or a fire.]

Chris: What is that?

Piers: You really don’t remember anything, do you? Bioterrorism.

[Chris is overwhelmed by flashes of memories of his past.]

Chris: Bio...

Piers: You can’t hide from your past, Chris, no matter where you go or what you do.

Chris: Who are you? What is this?

Piers: OK… You don’t remember me? Well how about them?

[He shows him pictures on his phone. Andy Walker, deceased Dec 24, 2012. Carl Alfonso, deceased Dec 24, 2012. Ben Airhart, deceased Dec 24, 2012. Finn Macauley, deceased Dec 24, 2012.]

Piers: Look! I said look! Those were your men! Men who died under your command! You owe it to them to remember, Chris. If you walk away now, then this was all for nothing!

[Chris hits Piers’ arm and the phone flies out of it.]

Chris: Enough!

Piers: Damn it! Six months of searching for you, and this is what I find!

Chris: BSAA…

Piers: Yeah. It’s where you belong. Everyone’s waiting.

Chris: Everyone?

[Most of the customers at the bar get up from their seats and approach Chris.]

Piers: We’re taking you back, Captain. One way or another.

Chris (thinking): I can’t keep running away. I have to face the truth, accept responsibility. That’s the only way I’ll ever remember. The only way I’ll get my life back.

June 30, 2013
Waiyip, China

[Chris is flying in a helicopter with his squad.]

Radio: HQ to Alpha Team. No change to your mission. Suppress the bioterror outbreak while proceeding to point Ace of Spades.

Chris: Roger that. Preparing to drop on the Eight of Clubs. We’ll make our way to the Ace of Spades and find those U.N. workers.

Radio: Echo to HQ! We’ve encountered hostiles at Diamond Three. Moving in to engage!

Radio: HQ, copy.

[Chris and Piers together kick the door down and get right into reporter’s camera.]

Reporter: The BSAA has arrived on the scene, Excuse me, can I get a comment please? Excuse me! Is this outbreak related to the situation back in the States? Is the BSAA involved there as well?

[Chris isn’t paying attention to the reporter.]

Chris: (sighs) Look at this. All civilians! Clear out of the way!

Radio: Come in, HQ! Route 4 is a mix of civvies and hostiles! Got anything else?

[Military trucks near Chris are hit by a rocket.]

Chris: Son of a-!

Radio: Alpha Team. Switch course from Route 4 to Route Niner. Head to the destination through the building in the Six of Clubs. HQ to all teams. Alpha is en route to Ace of Spades. After they rendezvous with Delta, we will proceed with the operation as planned.

Radio: Copy that. HQ to Charlie - assist Bravo at the Four of Hearts.

[Chris kills some bastard who pointed a gun at a civilian.]

Chris: Not while I’m around, pal.

[Piers shoot J’avo right in the head but it’s seems to be pretty fine.]

Chris: It’s healing itself!

Piers: Piers to HQ! We’ve made contact with J’avo! It’s the same kind we dealt with back in Edonia!

Radio: Copy that. Proceed with extreme caution.

Piers: (to the squad) Move, move, move! Oh, shit!

[Some J’avo fires a rocket at them.]

Chris: We’ve got to put an and to this mess.

Radio: Alpha Team. Proceed along Route Niner. Take a back alley to get to the Ace of Spades.

Piers: Captain, you remember anything yet?

Chris: I’m still trying to wrap my head around what I’m seeing here.

Piers: You know, I figured you’d be a little rusty, but it looks like all that training’s kicking right in.

Chris: Can the chatter. You ready?

[They kill a bunch of J’avo.]

Chris: All clear!

Radio: Echo to HQ! We can’t hold them off. Retreating from Diamond Three.

Radio: HQ to Echo! Requesting immediate status update! What’s going on?

Radio: We’re overwhelmed. There’s just too many of them! We’ve got no choice, we have to fall back!

[They stumble upon a new kind of J’avo, a mutant with a huge hand. Chris is a little dumbfounded. The mutant is trying to take advantage of it to attack him.]

Piers: Captain!

[He saves him and they start fighting against the crowd of J’avo.]

Piers: Alpha to HQ. We just witnessed a J’avo mutation.

Chris: Shoot it! Keep them back!

Piers: All clear!

Chris: You two. Stay here and tend to the wounded.

Piers: (radio) HQ. Alpha Team reporting. I got four of us heading along Route Niner.

Piers: Enemy sighted! Find cover!

Piers: HQ, we’ve encountered a Type 5 mutation.

Chris: Wings. Great.

Radio: Charlie to HQ! We’ve regrouped and are awaiting new orders! Things aren’t going too well over at the Three of Diamonds... They need you down there!

Radio: Roger that.

[Chris and Piers come down on the rope, but a rocket hits them again. The rope breaks and Chris can barely keep Piers from falling. The heroes split up.]

Piers: Captain!

Chris: I guess the muscle memory saved me there. Hey Piers, I’m taking a little fire here! I saved your ass - you wanna return the favor? I’m gonna need a hand here. Make your way back to me A.S.A.P.

Radio: We’ll radio HQ for backup. You two proceed to the Ace of Spades.

Radio: Roger.

Chris: Where the hell do they keep coming from? Piers, can I get some cover?

Piers: No problem, Captain.

Radio: HQ to Bravo! Alpha needs to move out to Ace of Spades. Can you relieve them?

Radio: Roger. Coming in from the Four of Hearts. En route to assist.

Radio: HQ to Alpha Team. You’re almost at the Ace of Spades.

Piers: Goddammit, an RPG!

Radio: Bravo to HQ! We’re taking some major heat over here! I don’t think we’ll make it in time to relieve Alpha!

Radio: HQ here. Copy that.

Piers: Huh. Guess it’s just the two of us then.

Chris: Chris to HQ. We’re at the Ace of Spades.

Radio: Copy that. Bravo Team has been dispatched to assist with search and rescue. Standby for instructions.

Piers: Good, I needed a break.

Chris: Dammit!

Piers: We’ve been spotted. They’re right on top of us!

Radio: HQ to Bravo Team. Alpha Team’s surrounded by hostiles, Get to the Ace of Spades on the double.

Radio: Alpha Team, this is Bravo! We’re moving as fast as we can. Keep your panties on everyone!

Piers: Alpha Team here. Roger that. We’ll do what we can until you get here.

[Alpha continues to hold positions, killing many J’avo and mutants.]

Piers: How many of these assholes do we have to kill!?

Chris: Where the hell’s that backup!?

Bravo: Hey, guys! Happy to see us? Bravo Team, weapons hot! Don’t leave any J’avo standing!

Chris: Finally!

Piers: Choose your targets and let’s finish this!

Radio: All B.O.W.s have been eliminated. Alpha Team, help Bravo Team get the civvies out of there.

[Alpha enters the Ace of Spades.]

Radio: HQ to Alpha. We have your mission brief. Rescue the hostages on the first and seventh floors, then get out of the building. As soon as all teams are clear, we will commence bombing.

Piers: Clear!

Radio: HQ to Alpha. The hostages are just up ahead of you. Eliminate the hostiles in there and get those people out of there.

Piers: Alpha here. Roger that. We’re going in.

[They kick the door down. As it turns out, the hostages are held by spider-like mutants dragging them on their backs.]

Piers: Alpha to HQ! Seventh floor hostage rescued! Where is the other hostage?

Radio: The floor above you. You need to move quickly.

Radio: Delta Two to HQ! All hostages on the top floor are secured! I’m leaving the building now!

Piers: Alpha to HQ! Eighth floor hostage secured!

Radio: Copy that.

Chris: There’s one more on the first floor.

Radio: Delta One to HQ! All hostages on the fifteenth floor are secured! Leaving the building now!

Piers: OK, that just leaves us.

[The elevator they’re taking stops.]

Chris: It stopped. Now what?

Piers: I can get through the ceiling if you give me a hand.

[This is the third time they’ve been directly shot by an RPG.]

Piers: Captain! You OK?

Chris: Yeah, I’m fine. Kinda getting the feeling we’re not welcome here.

Piers: Come on. We can take them.

Chris: I’m going in!

Piers: Clear!

Radio: This is Delta One! I’m clear of the building!

Radio: HQ here. Copy that.

Radio: This is Delta Two! I’m clear of the building!

Radio: HQ here. Copy that. Alpha is still on premises. Bombing will start once they’re clear.

Chris: I’m going in. Ready?

Piers: First floor hostage secured.

Radio: Copy that, Alpha. Now clear out of there.

Piers: Come in HQ! All hostages are OK! Alpha Team is clear!

Piers: Copy that. Commencing with bombing.

[But ironically, the exit collapses right in front of their eyes.]

Chris: Shit, we’re trapped. What the hell do we do now?

Piers: I don’t know.

Radio: HQ to Alpha. You can get out on the third floor. There’s a balcony on the west side of the building. Get moving! Alpha Team, get out of there now. Preparations to bomb the building are complete. Planes have been scrambled.

Piers: We don’t want to be here when those birds show up.

Chris: They’ve started bombing. Guess they don’t care that we’re still in here.

Piers: It’s not personal. You know the mission takes priority.

Chris: This building isn’t gonna last long! Hurry! Piers! Go around it!

Piers: Roger!

[They manage to get out by quick and coordinated action. Looking at the burning remnants of J’avo, Chris recalls his dead team. Memories can be quite painful.]

Piers: Captain?

Chris: Finn...

Chapter 2
December 24, 2012
Edonia, Eastern Europe

[Several soldiers gathered to say goodbye to their dead comrade. Chris approaches.]

Piers: He was running recon. Alone.

Chris: Listen up! In the BSAA, our job is to rid the world of bioterrorism, and the only way we’re gonna do that is by-sticking together.

Piers: Nobody’s expendable.

Chris: Exactly. Now each and every one of you may be ready to die for our cause, but it’s my job to make sure we all get through this alive.

[Finn wipes his snot.]

Piers: Suck it up, Finn!

Finn: Sorry, sir.

Chris: No one gets left behind, not on my watch. Understood?

Squad: Yes, sir!

Piers: Finn, give us the update.

Finn: Yes, sir! The guerrillas are using a new species of B.O.W. Command is calling them “J’avo.” They are extremely intelligent, incredibly strong, and have the ability to mutate in response to physical trauma. All right, you know the drill. We split into three teams. Move out!

Squad: You got it! Yes, sir!

Chris: (to Finn) You’re the rookie, huh?

Finn: Yes, sir. Finn Macauley, sir.

Chris: I know you’re nervous, Finn, but the team’s got your back. OK?

Finn: Yes, sir! I’ll give this everything I’ve got!

[Chris leaves.]

Finn: (to Piers) Is he always this awesome?

[They board an APC and leave, but soon they will have to go into battle.]

Piers: Enemy fire! Enemy fire! Alpha Team, engage!

Chris: All troops spread out! Return fire! Come in HQ! We’re taking fire at the Two of Hearts! Engaging the enemy!

Radio: Copy that. Keep an eye out for of those powered up soldiers.

Radio: Alpha Team, come in. Our units are spread too thin right now. I’m afraid we can’t offer you any assistance.

Chris: Copy that. We’ll go it alone then.

Radio: You’re sitting ducks out here, Alpha. Get inside that building.

Chris: Are these the new species HQ was warning us about?!

Piers: Bullets don’t even phase ’em... This ain’t our normal class of enemy!

[A huge monster with an umbilical cord on its back comes out from behind the buildings.]

Piers: I didn’t know they came in extra large! How many new species are there!?

[Heroes struggle for a short time, and then they manage to escape from the monster.]

Chris: Finn! We’ve got a huge B.O.W. on our tails! I need the A.P.C.’s firepower, now!

Finn: Removing the barricade now, sir! I’ll be there as soon as I can!

[Chris shoots the monster’s umbilical cord and the monster falls, then the APC arrives and shoots the monster with a machine gun. In its dying agony, the monster manages to crawl away.]

Chris: Alpha to HQ. Our route’s blocked by a B.O.W.

Radio: Change course from Route One to Route Four.

Finn: (via radio) Those things were enormous! I didn’t know B.O.W. could get that big!

Radio: They’re giving ’em new stuff. They can make any kind of freak show they want.

Finn: Dammit! There all over us!

Piers: Use the A.P.C. for cover! Hurry! Get behind it! Find cover! We’ll be torn apart in the open!

Finn: I’ll use the A.P.C. to get through that fence! I think I hit an anti-tank mine! The A.P.C.’s busted!

Piers: Finn! Get over here! I need you to blow this fence!

Finn: I’m on it sir! Setting charges now!

Piers: There’s a train car blocking the way! This route’s a no-go!

Finn: I’ll blow the car and clear a path! I need you to cover me till I get it set! Working as fast as I can here... Hang in there!

Piers: How much longer, Finn?

Finn: Almost done! It’s ready to blow! Grab some cover!

[The squad goes out to the big half-destroyed bridge.]

Radio: HQ to Alpha Team. City Halls on the other side of the bridges Pick up Bravo and move in.

Chris: What’s the status? Any casualties?

Radio: They’ve got a man down on the bridge.

Piers: Tank on the bridge! The whole thing is blocked.

Chris: OK, people! Getting to the wounded is priority one!

Radio: Alpha Team! Lay down suppressing fire from the flank! All snipers, form on my mark! He’s just up ahead, but he’s hurt bad! You gotta get him out!

Finn: Copy that! I’ll take point!

[One of the cars on the bridge explodes and the bridge starts to collapse. Chris climbs to the undestroyed part.]

Finn: Captain! Over here!

Chris: I owe you one, Finn. How’s our injured friend?

Finn: Still with us! I’m going to administer first aid!

Radio: Alpha Team, come in! There’s an old T-42 tank moving on your position. Looks like it’s had some modifications.

Finn: They’re bringing out the big guns for us. Be careful, Captain!

Chris: I’m gonna need a bigger gun.

Piers: Captain! If you draw the tank out of position, I can take care of that truck!

Chris: Nice shooting, Piers!

Piers: (to his squad) The way is clear. We better catch up with Captain Redfield. Let’s go.

Chris: I’m heading for the upper level of the bridge. Meet me up on top. Piers! I’m gonna lower the ladder. Come on up!

[On the rails on the bridge, a monster of the military industry, a giant cannon, is riding on Chris.]

Chris: Enemy reinforcements are moving Finn, I need you here!

Finn: (via radio) I got a Bravo here that can’t walk! Go on without me for now!

Chris: No one on this team gets left behind.

Piers: We’ll hold our positions for now! I don’t care if you have to drag him, just get your butts up here!

Finn: Yes, sir! On my way!

Piers: We’ve gotta keep this bridge secure until Finn gets back.

Squad: Roger!

Piers: Finn! Report your current location!

Finn: I’m at the bottom of the ladder, sir! Almost there!

Finn: Here, sir!

Piers: OK, time to get to work!

Chris: We need to cut off their reinforcements. I want you to blow the bridge.

Finn: Yes, sir! I’ll get started planting the explosives!

Piers: All right, make it quick!

Finn: It’s all set to blow!

Chris: Everyone, fall back and find cover!

Piers: Captain! We’ve got a railway gun in play!

[They meet a girl and a young man...]

Sherry: Sherry Birkin – National Security!

Chris: Sherry Birkin? You were in Raccoon City.

Sherry: How do you know that?

Chris: Claire.

Sherry: Wait... Are you Chris?

Chris: My sister’s told me all about you.

Piers: Chris, that man is a wanted insurgent.

Sherry: Yes, he’s a mercenary. But right now he’s under the protection of the U.S. government. He’s no threat to the BSAA.

Jake: Unless someone pays me to be.

Piers: What did you just say?

Jake: What?

Chris: Nothing.

Radio: HQ to Alpha Team. Reinforcements are unable to land due to anti-aircraft artillery. Take ’em out!

Chris: Alpha Team, copy.

Radio: What the—!? We’re picking up a large bogey on radar. It’s heading right for you!

[At this point, several helicopters are bringing in huge monsters attached by ropes. The monsters have an umbilical cord on their backs, which is also attached to the helicopter. One of the monsters is dropped near the heroes.]

Chris: We’ll talk later. Right now, you need to find cover.

[The battle with the monster begins.]

Radio: Alpha Team, come in. This is Echo. Those three anti-aircraft turrets are holding us at bay.

Chris: Roger that, Echo. We’ll take care of them for you.

Finn: Our first target’s over here!

Sherry: Chris! We’ll give you a hand!

Chris: Out of the question! You need to get to safety!

Sherry: Don’t worry about me. I can handle myself, and you need the help!

Jake: Christ... My chances of survival were higher when I was a soldier of fortune.

Finn: I’m setting charges on-the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! Just need a little more time! The charges are set! Everyone get back!

Radio: Only two guns left!

Finn: OK, head to the next target! I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! Just need a little more time! The charges are set! Everyone get back!

Radio: Good job, Alpha! One gun left! There’s another giant B.O.W. closing in on your location!

Piers: It’s the one we lost at the Two of Hearts!

Chris: Alpha! Prepare to engage!

Piers: Only one to go! Everyone into that underground passage!

Finn: I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! I need you to distract that giant B.O.W.! I can’t work with that B.O.W. around! Just need a little more time! I’m setting the charges now! The charges are set! Everyone get back!

Radio: Good work out there, Alpha! Echo Team will be landing shortly.

Chris: I already gave the pilot the coordinates.

Sherry: Thank you so much for your help.

Chris: (to Jake) Hey... Hey! Have we met?

Jake: You jarheads all look the same to me pal, sorry.

[Piers wants to punch him in the face, but Chris stops him.]

Piers: You’ve gotta be kidding me!

Chris: My mistake. Have a safe flight.

Piers: Captain, we’re crazy for letting him walk away! How many men have we lost to mercenaries like him!

Chris: He’s not our problem. We can’t lose sight of the BSAA’s mission.

Finn: To fight bioterrorism, sir.

Piers: I know what we’re here for, rookie.

[The squad enters the City Hall, that looks like Spencer’s Mansion from the first game. There are expensive paintings, moldings, columns around... and lots of bodies covered in sticky white liquid.]

Chris: OK, spread out. Search this place top to bottom.

Finn: Are these… people?

Piers: I’m picking up life-form readings. It’s like they’re in cocoons.

Finn: Who’s there!? Over here! I’m getting a reading on the other side of this door!

Chris: Piers, Finn - you’re with me. Everyone else, keep searching out here.

Piers: (radio) HQ, three of us are splitting off from the group. Heading further into the building.

[They break down the door and go inside. Jumping to the ground floor with a few "cocoons" they find an unpleasant surprise...]

Piers: One of them’s hatching, sir!

Chris: Call it in to HQ!

Piers: Roger!

[Chris kills a hatched armoured monster by breaking the armour on his back and destroying the nerve node.]

Piers: B.O.W.s neutralized.

Chris: Search the rest of the place, but stay on your guard.

[Soon they find a room with lots of syringes on the floor. Piers picks one up and hands it over to Chris.]

Piers: Captain.

Voice: “C-Virus.” That’s what the guerrillas were calling it.

[Ada comes out of the shadows with her hands up.]

Ada: Nice to see the cavalry’s here.

Piers: Who are you?

Ada: I work here. My name’s Ada Wong. They held me hostage.

Chris: C-Virus. That must be what’s creating those J’avo.

Ada: Yeah, I heard them saying something about that.

Piers: What else did you hear?

Ada: Maybe you could put your guns down first?

Chris: Not until you give us a reason to.

Ada: Neo-Umbrella.

Chris: Neo-Umbrella?

Ada: The organization supporting the guerrillas. Or at least I think that’s what they were calling themselves.

Piers: So the C-Virus came from them.

Ada: That’s all I know.

Chris: Thank you. We appreciate your cooperation. Finn. You’re in charge of keeping her safe.

Finn: Yes, sir!

Chris: (whispers to Piers) Keep an eye on her.

Piers: Will do.

Chris: We’ve found one of the staff. Returning to the foyer now.

Ada: Come on. I’ll show you a quick way back to the entrance.

[They go out into the hall where there’s a real war with monsters is going on.]

Soldier 1: Shit! They’re everywhere!

Soldier 2: We’ll never get out! Everyone, get to the second floor! The foyer’s too dangerous!

Ada: There’s a way out on the second floor. I suggest we take it. Your friends are having a hard time.

Finn: Ma’am, please, just try to stay out of the way. We can’t advance unless we eliminate these hostiles! It’s too dangerous to advance with these hostiles around! All hostiles eliminated! Let’s move!

Ada: This door leads to the warehouse next door. We can get outside through there.

[Chris and his squad run through corridors full of fast and dangerous monsters, protecting Ada.]

Chris: We’re almost out. Just hold it together, people.

Finn: Yes, sir.

[When they walk into a room on the second floor, Piers notices that Ada is missing.]

Piers: The woman - she’s gone. Finn!

Finn: (confused) I don’t know what happened. She was here a second ago!

[Suddenly, the grid falls from above, separating Chris and Piers from the rest of the squad. Ada walks nearby.]

Chris: Ada!

Ada: Thanks for the escort. Here’s something to remember me by.

[She throws a sphere that explodes and throwing syringes with C-Virus. Every member of the squad gets an injection except Chris and Piers. They begin to transform into cocoons.]

Chris: No… No, goddamn it! No! Finn, hang in there! Not like this!

Finn: (mouthful) Captain!

Chris: Finn! No, goddamn it!

Piers: Captain, we gotta move!

[The cocoons explode and monsters appear.]

Piers: Now! We gotta go!

[Turned into a monster Finn attacks Chris and knocks him out. ]

Piers: Chris!

[He pulls it off with one hand and the other carries out suppressing fire.]

Chapter 3
June 30, 2013
Waiyip, China

[Soldiers burn cocoons with flamethrowers. Chris sits on the asphalt, immersed in his unhappy memories. Piers approaches.]

Chris: Piers...

Piers: Sir?

Chris: What happened to Ada Wong?

Piers: You remember! Captain?

Chris: Where is she?

Piers: She’s leading Neo-Umbrella. All these terrorists are-

Chris: Is she in this city or not!

Piers: She’s been sighted several times since the attacks began. Yeah, she’s here.

Chris: Tell the men we’re moving out.

Piers: Yes, sir.

Chris: (thinking) Damn you to hell, Wong.

[As they sneak through the rubble and the ruin, they enter the tunnel. A huge invisible snake appears out of nowhere and grabs one of Chris’s soldiers.]

Chris: Shit!

Chris: (radio) Alpha to HQ! We re engaging a hostile!

Chris: Piers! Marco! Everyone on me! We’re going after that thing!

Piers: You heard the man, people. Let’s move! Go!

[They enter a building.]

Piers: OK, let’s move in, but be careful.

[Several J’avo decide to stop them.]

Chris: Assume battle positions!

[When they leave the building, they notice Sherry and Jake on the street.]

Piers: They’re alive! They went missing six months ago in Edonia.

[There’s a combat helicopter coming in.]

Piers: Neo-Umbrella’s after them! Captain!

Chris: Spread out! (quietly and as if to himself) Take every one of those damned things down.

Radio: Captain, it’s Marco. That’s an armored chopper they’ve brought in.

Radio: That rules out conventional arms.

Radio: We need to protect those two down there.

Chris: Forget the chopper for now. Engage the J’avo.

Radio: Captain, Keaton here. I can’t reach those two on the radio. They’re not responding. What should we do?

Chris: We wipe out the hostiles. After that they’re on their own. I’ve never seen a mutation like that before. Reid, uplink a reading to HQ.

Radio: Already on it, sir. Careful! These suckers can really jump!

Radio: Don’t let up! These assholes have killed enough for one day!

Chris: Cover them! Drop all of those J’avo!

Piers: (radio) We still got a few left! That’s the last one! The chopper’s pulling back!

Chris: That’d be too easy. C’mon, keep moving.

Piers: (radio) Captain, we should escort those two outta here. They’ll never survive on their own.

Chris: We’re moving out. Let’s go!

Radio: We’re gonna blow the door. Get ready!

Chris’ Soldier 1: Interesting. Their legs are like… like a grasshopper’s.

Chris’ Soldier 2: I don’t care what they are. Long as they stay dead when ya kill ’em.

Piers: The chopper’s back to finish the job!

Piers: (radio) HQ, come in! This is Alpha! The chopper is targeting us now!

Chris: Everyone! Bring that chopper down and bring it down hard!

[He picks up a grenade launcher and goes up to the roof. Chris’ unit is destroying the helicopter. Chris is looking at Sherry and Jake from the roof.]

Piers: Captain, we can’t let them go!

Chris: Our mission is to terminate the B.O.W.s.

Piers: But Neo-Umbrella is after them. Shouldn’t we--

Chris: I said, our mission is to terminate the B.O.W.s. I’m going after that B.O.W. Ada’s not getting away with this.

Piers: Captain, please, you need to think things through.

Piers: (radio) Alpha Team to HQ. We’re in pursuit of the target.

[They find the mangled corpse of a soldier caught by the snake earlier.]

Chris’ Soldier 1: Shit... That’s no way to go out.

[He kicks the door to the next room and examines it.]

Chris’ Soldier 1: Clear!

[From afar, the metal rattle is heard.]

Chris’ Soldier 2: What was that!?

Chris: That’s the target!

Chris’ Soldier 2: Dammit! Why won’t this thing show itself?

[The snake grabs another soldier. Chris is running after it.]

Piers: Captain, wait! What the hell were you thinking, pulling a kamikaze stunt like that!?

Chris: (keen) These are my men. You follow my lead or I’ll find someone who will.

Piers: Do you even hear yourself?

[Chris slowly turns around and comes close to Piers.]

Chris: Fall in line, soldier.

Piers: You heard the man. Let’s move.

Chris’ Soldier 1: How are we supposed to drop this thing, if we can’t even see it?

Chris: Shut up and keep moving!

Chris’ Soldier 1: Keaton! Not you too!

[He checks another room.]

Chris’ Soldier 1: Clear! Dammit, it’s not here either!

[The snake breaks the ceiling and grabs another soldier.]

Chris’ Soldier 1: Reid! Reid! Let him go, you piece of shit!

[They go out into the courtyard.]

Chris’ Soldier 1: (radio) I found it! It’s making its way downstairs! Repeat, it’s headed downstairs! You’re not getting away, you sneaky piece of shit!

Chris: This shit’s in the way! Give me a hand!

[They’re going down the ropes. At this moment, the snake grabs another one. Everyone falls down and separates.]

Chris: Everyone, report in!

Piers: (radio) Piers here. I’m on the third floor.

Chris’ Soldier 1: (radio) Captain! I can’t find Jeff. He’s gone!

Chris: Get a hold of yourself, Marco! Where are you?

Chris’ Soldier 1: (radio) Second floor! Oh, shit! I think that thing’s here!

Chris: Target is on the second floor! You all need to come here - now!

[He find his soldier’s body.]

Chris: Reid! Goddamn it.

Chris’ Soldier 1: (radio) That’s him screaming! I’m coming, man! Just hang on!

Chris: Marco, don’t move. Hold your position! Do you hear me? That’s an order!

[Chris finds Piers and they go to the second floor. The snake kicks the door down by one of Chris’s soldiers.]

Chris’ Soldier 1: It’s... it’s inside.

Chris: OK, we find that piece of shit and we put it down - fast and hard!

[He finds another body...]

Chris: Jeff! Poor bastard.

[They go to the butcher shop. A snake appears from above and tries to grab another soldier.]

Piers: Ceiling!

[Chris manages to save the soldier. This time the snake decides to fight a pretty thin squad.]

Chris: About time you showed your ugly face.

Chris’ Soldier 1: There! It’s right there!

[Chris shoots a shotgun straight at the snake’s face several times.]

Chris: You killed my men!

[Figuring out its chances, the snake retreats.]

Piers: I think it went through there, Captain.

[Soon they meet again.]

Chris: I’m taking you down! It’s gone. After it!

Piers: I know that thing is in here. Time to put an end to this.

Chris: Die, you sack of shit!

[After receiving decent damage, the snake breaks down the door and runs away.]

Chris: After it!

[The corridors lead them to a room with electric boards, in which giant plugs.]

Piers: Its hide has toughened up or something! Our weapons aren’t doing anything!

Chris: Then we have to find something that will!

[One of the plugs is falling out.]

Piers: Marco! I need power for this thing!

Marco: I’m on it!

[He plugs in the plug and gets a discharge of current.]

Chris’ Soldier 1: Heh... We did it. We fried that son of a bitch!

Piers: Marco! Are you OK? Marco!

[Marco’s helping Chris and Piers go to the top.]

Piers: Well… at least we got it.

Chris: But no Ada yet. I’m not gonna rest until we have her head on a stick.

Piers: This is crazy! It’s not safe in here. We need to pull out! Captain!

[Marco gets a dart in his neck.]

Ada: Looking for me, boys? Welcome to China.

Chris: Ada!

[Marco is turning into a cocoon.]

Piers: Wait! We’ve got no choice — we have to kill him! He’d do the same for us.

[Cocoon Marco explodes and a swarm of bees or flies gets out of it.]

Piers: Marco!

[Chris and Piers are destroying the swarm and the cocoon is falling apart. Inside the cocoon, they find the C-4 explosive that Marco was carrying. Chris knocks on the ground with his fist, picks up the explosives and blows down the door with it.]

Piers: Chris, we need to stay calm.

Chris: After what she’s done to us? How many of our men are dead because of that bitch!

Piers: I’m right there with you, Captain, but you’re personal vendetta isn’t gonna get us anywhere. If you hadn’t been blinded by vengeance, we could have prevented some of those deaths.

Chris: Shut up.

Piers: Do you even care about our mission anymore?

Chris: SHUT UP!

Piers: I feel sorry for all the men that died believing in you.

[Chris furiously presses Piers against the wall.]

Piers: What happened to the legendary Chris Redfield, huh? What happened to you! It’s a good thing Finn’s not around to see you this way.

Chris: I’m going after Ada. (radio) HQ, this is Alpha Leader. I need a location on Ada Wong...

Piers: I’m going with you. Someone’s gotta keep an eye on you... whether you want them to or not.

Radio: This is HQ! We’ve got the location for you. Ada Wong has left the city and is heading south for the harbor. HQ to all teams, target Ada Wong has been spotted, heading south for the harbor. We want her alive.

Chris: You wanna follow me around, fine. Just make sure you stay out of my way.

Piers: As long as you don’t cross the line again, that won’t be a problem. Ada’s just playing with you. When are you gonna realize that?

Chris: I’m not stupid enough to fall for her bullshit. You should have a little more faith in your captain.

[Chris and Piers walk out to the harbor. Small pontoons assembled from various materials float down the wide river. The infected attack the squad - they shoot at them from afar, causing Chris and Pierce to have to act tactically. Soon they catch up with Ada - she's just getting on the boat.]

Chris: Ada!

[Ada sails away and an attack helicopter flies up to the squad.]

Piers: Captain, get a hold of yourself! That helo's about to open up on us! We're sitting ducks out here! We need to find cover!

Chris: Dammit!

[They run as fast as they can. The helicopter fires machine guns and rocket launchers at them.]

Piers: You gotta be kidding me!

Chris: Don’t talk! Just run! Keep moving!

Piers: If we can just get to that building!

[They jump into a Chinese restaurant.]

Chris: (radio) Alpha to HQ! We got a visual on Ada Wong. We're in pursuit!

Radio: This is HQ. Ada Wong has been spotted moving down the canal. Charlie and Delta Teams, form a perimeter around Koocheng.

Chris: (to Piers) All right, we can drop that chopper from here.

[The downed helicopter crashes into a restaurant and catches fire.]

Chris: Let's go! 

[They jump out of the restaurant and it explodes.]

Chris: That's that. Now we get Ada. 

Piers: Copy that. 

[The squad comes ashore and goes to the 文西醫學研究所 -Vinci Medical Center-.]

Chris: She's here! 

Piers: Think this is where they've been developing the C-Virus?

[Chris looks around the warehouse of the building and notices Ada…]

Chris: Ada!

[He opens fire, but Ada flies away on a rope.]

Chris: You can't run forever! 

Piers: Alpha Team to HQ! Come in! We are in pursuit of Ada Wong! 

Chris: No use hiding, Ada. 

[He notices a rising elevator at the end of the hallway.]

Chris: Make a run for the elevator! Go!

[As the squad runs, they hear Leon and Helena's voices.]

Leon: (from another room) We're not alone in here.

Helena: (from another room) Probably whoever was shooting at Ada. One more thing to worry about.

[When Chris reaches the other end of the hallway, he sees Ada on the second floor. She speaks through the speakers.]

Ada: Glad you could stop in. Like what I've done with the place? Hope you enjoy your stay. (evil laugh)

[The passage is blocked by laser beams. Chris has to use all his dexterity to dodge them. When he reaches the source of the lasers he destroys them with a few skillful shots.]

Chris: Laugh while you can, Ada... Cause you're going down. 

[He and Piers take a freight elevator to the upper floors of the lab, the walls of which are lined with specimen containers.]

Piers: What the hell is all this...? 

Chris: Keep your eyes peeled. Who knows what this bitch has in store... 

[The door at the far end of the corridor is closed. Chris tries to force it open, but to no avail.]

Chris: We're locked in. 

Computer: Engaging locks. Testing for prototypes. 

Chris: Ada! 

[It activates compact robots, similar to robot vacuum cleaners, only with razor-sharp blades on the sides.]

Ada: We've been conducting such fascinating work here. Why don't you have some fun with one of the new prototypes? 

Piers: Her little bag of tricks isn't going to stop us! 

Chris: Keep those damn things back! I'll get the lock. 

[While Piers distracts the "vacuum cleaners," Chris tries to hack into the door activation panel.]

Computer: Security breach detected in Room One. Disengaging locks in Room One. 

Chris: Let's move! There's no time to waste! 

Piers: Someone doesn't want us to catch Ada. She might not be working alone. 

Chris: Give it up, Ada. It's over! 

Ada: Oh, is the big, bad soldier going to shoot me? 

Chris: Stand down, Piers!

[He runs after Ada.]

Piers: Captain! Get a hold of yourself! 

Ada: It's been fun. Ciao.

[She flies away on a rope.]

Chris: Ada! Don't lose her! 

Piers: I won't! 

Chris: Ada! 

Helena: (nearby) Your friend likes to play hard to get. She always been like this? 

Chris: (to Piers) There she is! Cut her off! 

Piers: I've got her! 

[Piers stops Ada with shots on the floor. He and Chris surround her. Suddenly someone knocks the machine gun out of Chris's hands. It's Leon. A melee begins, ending with guns pointed at each other.]

Leon: Chris!

Chris: Leon? What are you doing here?

[Helena comes running in.]

Leon: Put your gun down, Chris. She's a key witness, we need her. 

Chris: A witness!? She's the one who did all this! 

Leon: No! It wasn't her - it was Simmons, the National Security Advisor. 

Chris: I lost all my men because of her! 

Leon: And I lost over 70,000 people, including the president, because of Simmons! 

Chris: She's working for Neo-Umbrella. You know what that means? 

Leon: Yeah, I do. 

Chris: And you're still going to protect this woman?

Leon: I am.

[Ada reaches into her pocket…]

Piers: Captain!

[She throws a flash grenade and jumps to a level below.]

Piers: Freeze! 

[He shoots, but Ada gracefully dodges the shots and runs away.]

Piers: Damn it! (runs after Ada)

[Helena runs after Piers.]

Leon: Helena! 

Helena: He's gonna kill her! 

[Blinded by rage, Chris is also about to run after Ada, but Leon stops him.]

Leon: Chris, wait! We both want the same thing here. 

Chris: All right. The BSAA will handle Ada. You take care of Simmons.

[He walks away. Leon talks to his back.]

Leon: Chris. I know you'll do the right thing.

[Piers, meanwhile, shoots at Ada's car as it drives away.]

Piers: She's making a break for the harbor. Get in!

Chris: Hey, Piers. What you said, about me hiding from my past. You were right.

Piers: Captain?

Chris: Can you catch up to her?

Piers: Won't stop until I do.

[They get into a military vehicle. Chris gets behind the machine gun.]

Piers: (radio) This is Piers Nivans! Ada Wong is moving south towards the military port! Advising all personnel to be on the alert! (to Chris) Don't bother! We can handle this!

Chris: I've had enough of these stupid games!

[They are chasing Ada at high speed.]

Chris: Chris to HQ! Block of all the exits!

Radio: Sorry, no can do. All of our units are currently engaged. I don't have any to spare.

Piers: Dammit! Do you think this is part of her plans? Give up Ada! We got you! You're not getting rid of us that easily! I'm the best driver the BSAA's got!

Radio: Alpha, come in! This is Delta! We hear you're zeroing in on Ada Wong! We're trying to hold out on our end, but we ain't gonna last long! You've gotta catch that woman, before this gets any worse!

Chris: Don't worry soldier! We will! You just keep those civilians safe!

Radio: Roger that! Good luck! Hopefully we can put an end to this shit storm! Delta out!

[Trying to get away from his pursuers, Ada throws a grenade onto the road. The explosion throws Chris's car onto the railroad tracks.]

Piers: Captain! There's a train coming!

[They dodge the train and get back on the highway.]

Chris: Hey! Grab your gun! I'm taking the wheel! Hang on! I'm taking a short cut! There we go! She's not getting away again. You're not gonna lose us, Ada!

Radio: HQ to Alpha! We've spotted an aircraft carrier of unknown origin in the harbor. Chatter we've picked up indicates it might belong to Neo-Umbrella.

[Ada drives aboard the aircraft carrier.]

Piers: Then that's where Ada's headed! We can't let her reach it!

Chris: Hold on! I'm gonna jump it!

[He jumps on the car, smashing it to the floor of the loading zone. Both heroes roll out of the car and are not seriously injured. Ada, standing nearby, slowly walks away.]

Chapter 4
Chris: Piers!

[Piers fights off an infected man wearing a strange helmet that makes him look like an insect.]

Piers: I'm good, captain!

[In the distance, another infected prepares a sniper rifle and opens fire.]

Chris: Keep your head down! They've got their sights locked on us! Careful. These enemies are different.

Piers: So these are Neo-Umbrella's finest, huh?

Chris: (radio) Alpha to HQ. We're closing in on Ada Wong.

Radio: HQ here. Copy that.

Piers: We have to figure out where on board she's hiding.

[They spot Ada on the upper level, but one of the infected raises a ladder leading to the top.]

Chris: We need to get up those stairs. Hurry, we can't let her get away.

[In addition to the raised stairs, the massive bulkhead door closes.]

Piers: Well, that's just great, what else can go wrong? How the hell are we supposed to get the bulkhead open?

Chris: We'll figure something out. That's our job. You and I have a mission to complete. Got it?

Piers: Yeah, I got it. Maybe we can blow it open.

Chris: Hey Piers! I found somethin' to take care of that bulkhead!

[He throws his partner over to the other half of the bridge as suddenly the halves begin to move and separate the squad.]

Chris: Piers, you OK?

Piers: Yeah, I'm fine.

Chris: Just keep going. We'll meet up eventually.

[They reunite and use a suspended rocket to blow up the massive bulkhead.]

Chris: Now that's how you open a door.

Piers: HQ, come in. We're continuing our mission to apprehend Wong.

Chris: Now, let's get those stairs back down.

[The squad goes outside and continues down the port side of the aircraft carrier. Chris prepares to jump below.]

Chris: I'm going for it.

Piers: Roger that!

[They find the control room and lower the stairs.]

Radio: HQ to Alpha. Fighting in the city has spread. You need to apprehend Ada Wong now.

Chris: Copy that. Tell our boys to hang in there.

[When the squad returns to the cargo hangar, a fighter jet with an infected in the cockpit descends on them from above. He starts firing large-caliber bullets all around.]

Piers: Are you kidding me!?

Chris: I think we've overstayed our welcome.

[The squad fights their way to the blasted door, fighting for every inch of the hangar. When they do manage to break through, they hear Ada's voice over the speakers…]

Ada: Can you feel it spreading through your body yet? I'm just giving you exactly what you gave me, Simmons. At first you'll be afraid, but don't worry. You're just becoming the monster you always were. You and everyone else on the planet. You and your Family may have shaped the world into what it is today, but starting tomorrow, it's all going to change.

[The squad rides up the elevator and sees Ada. It's rather odd that before she was wearing a blue dress and a red scarf, but now she's wearing a red jacket and jeans…]

Piers: It's Ada!

Chris: Ada, stop!

[They rush in pursuit skillfully and quickly eliminating the infected along the way.]

Piers: Found her!

Chris: Upstairs - move!

Piers: Dammit, she's toying with us!

Chris: I'll take care of these guys.

[Finally they find Ada… she's changed back into a blue dress with a scarf.]

Chris: Ada!

Ada: Still haven’t had enough, huh? Even after losing all your men - again? With your track record I gotta say, I'd hate to be a member of your team, Chris.

Piers: Don't listen to her, Captain.

Ada: But where are my manners? I mean, really, I should be thanking your men… ...foreing such good test subjects.

[Chris knocks the rope gun out of Ada's hands with a shot.]

Chris: Ever since Edonia, all I've wanted is to see you dead. But this isn't about vengeance, it's about justice. It's over, Ada.

Ada: You're right, it is. The aircraft carrier is preparing for launch.

Chris: (to Piers) Launch?

Ada: And the dead will flood the streets. Déjà vu, boys - Raccoon revisited. But this time, it won't just be one city. It'll be the whole world!

[Suddenly a helicopter flies up... the sniper on board shoots Ada in the chest and the helicopter flies away.]

Ada: You got me. Well played. But no one can stop it now...

[She falls down and crashes to her death, leaving behind a smear of blood and brains.]

Piers: Damn it! What the hell just happened!?

[He opens Ada's briefcase, which should contain three syringes, but there is only one.]

Piers: This looks like a different strain. There are two missing!

Chris: Just take what's left. We'll bring it back to HQ for analysis. (radio) This is Alpha Leader! I need a report on the missing vessels, ASAP!

Radio: The city has been compromised, and we’ve lost contact with all local assets. We need more time.

Chris: We don't have it! The terrorist assault was just a diversion! The real attack will spread the virus globally!

Piers: Now what?

Chris: Let's check the rear hangar. There have gotta be some planes back there.

Piers: Yes, sir!

Radio: Alpha Team, this is HQ. We've confirmed that Wong was telling the truth. There's a fully armed aircraft carrier in open water not far from your location. Satellite imaging indicates they're getting ready to fire missiles on the mainland. It's imperative that you stop them from launching even a single one.

Chris: Copy that, HQ. The bay is just up ahead. Hurry!

Piers: Yes, sir!

[The aircraft carrier begins to shake.]

Piers: This is makin' me seasick. You think this tub is gonna last much longer?

Chris: I don't want to hang around to find out. Come on!

[They find the panel that opens the gate, however…]

Chris: Dammit. We need three separate passcodes to get this open.

Piers: Fantastic. Well, let's go see if we can hunt them down.

[Chris removes the Key A from a corpse lying nearby.]

Chris: He's dead. Which means someone else is here. Anyway, we got the first code.

[New enemies appear - leeches, capable of reproducing using corpses. They are also quite hard to kill, because the detached limb begins to live its own life. Chris pulls out a grenade launcher.]

Piers: Aw come on. Give me a break! Finally! Let's get outta here! Captain! Let's get this thing opened, Captain! I'm ready when you are! Got the second one. Only one more to go. Found the last one. Let's head back.

[Chris uses all three keys and the door opens.]

Chris: Come on!

Piers: Right behind you.

[The squad is attacked by several leeches at once.]

Chris: I don't have time for you right now.

[Chris sends them swimming into the molten metal. He then finds the fighter jet and quickly jumps in with Piers.]

Chris: Let's get it fired up!

[Chris and Piers fly out of the aircraft carrier.]

Radio: HQ to Alpha. The aircraft carrier has been located. The carrier is armed with anti-aircraft artillery. Take out those guns, Alpha.

Piers: One plane against an entire carrier? Does that even sound possible?

Chris: Hey Piers! How's your aim?

Piers: Never better, Captain!

Radio: Prelaunch preparations have already begun, and there's nothing we can do to stop it from here.

Piers: The missile's carrying a virus. if it hits, it's gonna be a hell of a lot worse than a normal warhead. And the only way we can stop it is by getting on that carrier.

Chris: We've got no choice. OK, get ready, I'm going in. Ada said she wanted to bring Raccoon City to the world. But there's only one missle that we know of. Come in, HQ. Are there any other vessels in the water?

Radio: Negative. Intel says only the carrier.

Piers: She could have been making it up. I wouldn't put it past her.

Radio: All anti-aircraft guns have been destroyed.

Piers: All right, now we can stop that missile! Find a place to land, Captain!

[Chris drops Pierce off on the deck of the aircraft carrier.]

Radio: HQ to Alpha! The missile countdown has already started. Find the control unit and stop the launch!

Piers: Roger that, HQ, We're on it! (to Chris) Looks like my path is blocked. Nothin' a little pyrotechnics can't take care of!

Chris: OK, I've got you covered.

[A huge monster appears aboard the aircraft carrier…]

Piers: That looks like more trouble than we need!

Chris: Shit. This fight's about to get dirty! Hurry it up, Piers! We're runnin' out of time!

Radio: HQ to Alpha. Missile launch has been aborted.

Chris: Way-to-go, Piers! Now get back to the plane so we can get outta here!

Piers: Roger that!

Chris: Piers! Get to the crane! I'll pick you up!

Piers: Hey, Captain! The odds are a little uneven down here. A little help?

Radio: HQ to Alpha, we have an emergency! The missile is preparing to launch!

Chris: How in the hell!?

Piers: It's Ada. She knew we would try to stop it!

Radio: We're out of time, Alpha. Permission to destroy the missile granted!

Piers: Dammit, that thing's in our way!

Chris: All right, Piers take out those missiles!

Piers: Roger that!

[However, despite the missile hitting the aircraft carrier, the missile with the virus flies off its deck.]

Piers: It's heading for the city!

Radio: This is FOS. Is anyone there?

Piers: FOS?

Chris: Chris Redfield with the BSAA here.

Radio: Hold on, I'm patching you through to Agent Leon Kennedy.

Chris: What—? Leon!? Leon, where are you?

Leon: (via radio) Chris! We're just outside of Tatchi, why?

Chris: (screams) Get the hell outta there! 

[The missile explodes over the city, spraying a cloud of dark blue smoke. The locals, happy a second ago that it was over, are now forced to flee again and fight for their lives. The smoke has turned many of the survivors into bloodthirsty zombies, who attack those who have hidden in the restaurant, causing carnage. The street is in chaos. There's fire and dead bodies everywhere.]

Chris: Leon!? Leon, are you all right?

Leon: (via radio) Yeah… But things just got bad. Real bad!

Chris: (punches the wall of the jet) Damn it!

Leon: (via radio) Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin… ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.

Chris: Wesker!?

Leon: (via radio) Chris, he's got antibodies for the C-Virus.

Chris: I got it. On my way.

Leon: (via radio) Good. Thanks.

Chris: Leon, wait. There's something I need to tell you. (pauses) Ada Wong is dead.

Leon: (via radio, quietly) Copy. Sherry and Jake need you. Don't let them down.

Chapter 5
July 1, 2013
Chinese Waters

[A fighter jet with Chris and Piers on board flies to an oil production platform offshore. As they land on the helipad, they look around, preparing to meet the enemy immediately.]

Chris: Go!

[He opens a double door and the squad enters an elevator going deep under the water.]

Piers: There's irony for you. A man who spent his entire life trying to destroy the world, and now… his son is the only one who can save it.

Chris: And here I am coming to rescue him.

Piers: The man who killed his father. Like I said - irony.

Chris: I don't know, maybe it's fate. It's been 3 years since I killed Wesker. I can't let this war follow me forever. After we rescue Jake, I'm turning in my gun.

Piers: What!? Wait a minute—

Chris: It's about time someone took my place. And I'd be honored if it was you.

Piers: I... I don't think I'm ready for that.

Chris: You've made it this far, haven't you?

[The elevator stops.]

Chris: All right. This is it!

Piers: Who the hell has the funding to build something like this?

Chris: It's got Neo Umbrella written all over it. Be careful. Knowing them, there'll be some surprises.

Piers: Copy that.

[They go into the control room.]

Piers: Captain!

[Chris sees pictures of Jake and Sherry on the screen. They are being held captive.]

Chris: All right.

[He presses a few buttons and the handcuffs on Jake and Sherry's wrists open.]

Chris: I think I got it.

[The alarm goes on.]

Chris: They found us!

Piers: We gotta go! Captain, can you pinpoint their location?

Chris: They're in some sort of research bay. We can get there from the lower levels. Let's go get 'em! Piers! I need you to scope out an area for me! Can't get into the air ducts with these blades going. See if you can turn them off from up there.

Piers: Roger that. OK, it's off.

Chris: Roger. I'm going in.

Piers: (fighting) Ah, for Christ's sake.

Chris: I'll see what I find here. Wait for my command.

Piers: Roger that.

[They engage in a battle with the infected.]

Chris: Piers, I've got another set of blades in the way.

Piers: I'm on it: Just give me a minute. It's off. You're good to go.

Chris: Piers, I've restored power to the elevator.

Piers: Copy. I'll rendezvous with you up ahead.

Chris: Piers! I'm in the elevator. Headed your way.

Piers: Copy that, Captain.

[The squad continues to fight its way through the crowds of enemies.]

Computer: Engaging airlock. Connection to research block initiated. Please wait until the connection is complete.

[Chris and Piers have to fight off a crowd of infected in a small room for two minutes. Suddenly they hear a familiar voice from the speakers…]

Ada: Hello stranger.

Chris: …Ada!?

Ada: Yup. It's me. Or should I say… was me. Consider this my little parting gift to you. If you've made it this far, I'm assuming you are BSAA. Not that it matters. You still won't stop my plan. No one can. One missile and this world will be transformed… ...into a new "Eden." For my last… and greatest creation. He will thrive in the ashes of the burning cities… ...conquering all that remains after the fall. He will reign as king of the new era!

Piers: Something tells me this "new creation" isn't a pillow pet.

Chris: Piers! Can you get through to HQ?

Piers: No. Not unless we get topside.

Chris: So we're on our own. All right. Let's get Jake and Sherry the hell outta here! Come on!

Piers: Roger!

[The squad manages to survive the furious onslaught of the infected.]

Computer: Connection complete. Pressurizing area now. Please wait until air pressure levels have normalized.

[Two more minutes! The fierce fight continues.]

Chris: Don't let it pull the lever! Last thing we need is more cocoons!

Piers: Shit! They keep coming!

Chris: We're just gonna have to hold out!

Computer: Pressure normalized. Connection procedures complete. Disengaging the safety lock.

Piers: Let's go, Captain.

[The squad runs to the aid of Jake and Sherry.]

Sherry: Chris!

Chris: Glad to see you're OK.

Sherry: Wait, was that you who just freed us?

Jake: Looks like you guys saved the day again.

Chris: I can see your father in you.

Sherry: How did you know where—

Jake: Wait, hold on a second. So you knew him?

Chris: Yeah. I did. And I'm the one that killed him.

[Jake abruptly pulls a gun from his holster and points it at Chris. Piers prepares to shoot Jake. Tension hangs in the air.]

Jake: It was you?

Chris: That's right.

Piers: Chris!

Jake: You better put a leash on that puppy.

Chris: (to Piers) This is between me and him. (to Jake) Go ahead, shoot. You have every right to. Just promise me you'll survive. The world depends on it.

Jake: (in rage) Who the hell are you to tell me what to do!?

Sherry: Stop it!

Piers: Put your gun down! Now!

Jake: Tell me, were you just… ...following orders, or was it personal?

Chris: Both.

Sherry: Jake, please, stop!

Piers: ...before I put a bullet in your head!

Sherry: Just put your gun down. Don't do this!

[Jake screams, getting ready to shoot. He FIRES... but misses within an inch of Chris's face, leaving only a cut on his cheek.]

Jake: There are more important things at stake than you and me.

[An earthquake begins.]

Piers: We gotta go!

Sherry: Jake!

Jake: I know!

[He pulls the gun away from Chris's face. The heroes look up and see a huge cocoon attached to the walls of the shaft.]

Sherry: Guys! I think this is some sort of lift! There's one over there, too! Let's get outta here.

Computer: "HAOS Release Simulation" "Infection Rate 20%... 60%..." "Infection Rate 100%"

Chris: What the hell is this?

Piers: The end of the world.

Chris: Unless we stop it.

Sherry: So if that giant cocoon hatches...

Chris: We're in trouble. Just a bit.

Piers: We gotta get outta here and warn HQ! Hurry! Over here! This way! Hurry!

They enter an elevator platform attached to the wall of the shaft. Chris and Piers pull the handles and the elevator begins to slowly rise to the top. Jake and Sherry get on another platform.

Piers: Ya know, you didn't have to put yourself on the line like that. Wesker deserved what he got. You did what was right - you kept this world safe.

Chris: He was still his father. The kid had the right to know.

Piers: Well, I'll tell ya this much. I can't say I've lacked for adventure working with you.

Chris: Sorry, I know it's never been easy being my partner. Once we get outta here… all that's gonna change.

Sherry: (via radio) Listen... Jake.

Jake: (via radio) Spare me the lecture, all right? We need to find a way outta here.

Sherry: (via radio) I was only trying to – look, when this over, please, just talk to Chris. And not down the barrel of a gun, OK?

Jake: (via radio) It's my problem, not yours. Besides, I don't wanna think about that asshole or my father right now. I can worry about them if and when we get outta here.

[Infected appear in the walls of the shaft. The heroes have to use sniper rifles and shoot accurately. When they reach the top of the shaft the elevators unite and the cocoon begins to crack. The heroes aim their weapons at it. The monster that hatches turns out to be feminine-looking with flipper-like arms, which it uses to pummel the elevator.]

Chris: Look out!

[The monster's blow separates the heroes, and the monster itself falls down the shaft.]

Sherry: Chris!

Chris: Get moving!

Piers: We got it from here. Let's go.

Sherry: Wait!

Jake: You've got a job to finish.

[Jake and Sherry run away. Chris and Piers distract the monster and start to climb the shaft.]

Chris: Piers! We've gotta climb!

[They crawl up the stairs and the monster chases them.]

Chris: Hurry! He'll take us down with him! Piers! Come on!

[He throws his partner to the top level.]

Piers: I gotcha!

Helping each other, they run up the shaft. The monster doesn't lag behind them even for a second, and at a certain point blocks their path.

Chris: Shit!

[The squad opens fire on the monster's head.]

Chris: OK, let's go!

Piers: That is one angry son of a bitch!

Chris: Releasing this thing must have been Ada's plan from the beginning!

Piers: Jesus! The missiles were only a distraction then!

[After fending off another attack, the heroes run into a freight elevator and up into a kind of laboratory, where the cocoon was most likely created. The monster crawls after them and emerges through a huge hole in the center of the room, through which the cocoon was lowered into the shaft.]

Piers: You've gotta be kidding me! That thing's still alive?

Chris: Not for long!

[He uses his grenade launcher at the monster.]

Piers: Shit, this thing won't die!

Chris: It better. We can't let this thing see the light of day! 

Finally the monster falls to the floor and stops moving. Chunks of metal begin to fall from the ceiling. The lab collapses and water fills the room. Chris is carried sideways, but he manages to grab onto the platform.

Chris: Piers! You all right?

[He floats up and grabs the platform, too.]

Piers: I've been better!

[They walk to the exit. However... the water begins to bubble strangely, but the squad does not notice it. They pass through the door and walk down a narrow underwater corridor. Suddenly a monster swims out for the heroes and attacks the corridor, trying to break it.]

Chris: Son of a bitch!

Piers: Captain! We're outta time! We gotta go! Argh! Captain, I can't get by! I'll be damned if I'm gonna die here.

[Chris runs as fast as he can to the other end of the corridor, dodging the breaking walls. Piers runs after him. When they reach the end, the floor of the corridor collapses and Pierce falls down, clinging to the wall. Chris grabs the door with his hands to keep it from closing.]

Chris: Hurry! Can't hold it…

[Piers climbs the wall into the next hallway and Chris releases the door.]

Piers: Thanks, Captain!

[The monster continues to attack. The windows of the laboratory are already covered with a significant number of cracks.]

Chris: We're sitting ducks in here!

Piers: You're right. We gotta move!

[The monster bursts into the corridor and crawls after the heroes, breaking the bulkheads. When it reaches the heroes, the monster wants to grab Chris, but Piers pushes him away.]

Piers: Captain!

[Chris shoots at the monster's flipper and it throws Piers against the wall. Pierce stumbles over the pin sticking out of the wall with his right hand and yells in pain…]

Chris: Piers!

[He runs to his partner. The monster throws a chunk of metal at Chris, but misses and completely flattens Pierce's right arm. The monster grabs Chris. Seeing this, Piers tears off the rest of his arm to free himself and crawls towards the monster... He pulls out Ada's syringe, sticks it in himself and a new coral-like arm with electric shocks grows in its place. Piers attacks the monster and it releases Chris. The last bulkhead rips the monster's legs off and it dies.

Chris: Oh God, Piers! What did you do?

Computer: Pressure abnormality detected. Sealing all doors. Restore pressure to regulation levels. Depressurization initialized.

[The dead monster turns into a stone from which the exact same monster bursts out!]

Chris: Piers! You have to fight it! Try to stay in control!

Computer: Please wait while pressure is reduced.

[When the monster dies again, Pierce uses an electric shock to break the stone and expose a vulnerable spot…]

Piers: Now's our chance! Fire!

[Chris plunges the knife into the monster's exposed, tumor-like vulnerability.]

Computer: Depressurization process is almost complete.

[The squad has to fight the monster again. When it takes enough damage, it pushes Chris away and he has to crawl to the "tumor" to stab it. Finally the monster is defeated. Mutated Piers barely stays conscious…]

Chris: Piers! Come on! Just stay with me! You're gonna be OK!

Piers: I'm sorry... Captain… I did it for the BSAA… For the future!

Chris: I know. You did a real good thing.

Piers: As long as you—

Chris: I don't wanna hear it! We're both getting outta here, all right? Let's go!

Computer: Depressurization process complete. Unsealing doors now.

Chris: I'm gonna get you through this, Piers. You hear me?

[They run, trying to leave the crumbling laboratory as quickly as possible.]

Computer: Warning. Facilities infrastructure compromised. Unable to withstand water pressure. All personnel, please evacuate immediately.

[On their way there is a barrier of hardened mucus.]

Piers: Stand back, Captain, I can kill this thing.

[He destroys the obstacle with a discharge of electricity.]

Computer: Warning. Facilities infrastructure compromised. Unable to withstand water pressure. All personnel, please evacuate immediately.

[At the very exit Piers collapses. His strength is running out.]

Chris: Piers! Damn it…

Piers: Just go!

Chris: No! You're gonna be OK! We're almost there!

[He helps Piers up.]

Chris: The escape pods! See that? We'll be outta here in no time. Come on… got it!

[The door of the escape pod opens.]

Chris: Here we go, Piers, we're gettin' out of here.

[However, Piers breaks free of Chris's grasp and pushes him into the capsule before locking the door.]

Chris: No! Piers! No, don't do this! Open the door! Goddamn it, listen to me! We can still both get outta here! There's still time! What are you doing? No, Piers, don't! You can still make it out! Goddammit, Piers! No! Piers! Open the goddamn door—that's an order! No…

[Piers launches the capsule.]

Chris: (screams) Piers!

[He falls to the floor of the capsule in helpless anger. However... the monster turns out to be alive. It swims to the capsule and grabs it. Suddenly a powerful electrical discharge tears the monster to pieces. The lab explodes. Chris's capsule rises to the surface. Chris opens the door, clutching the blood-stained BSAA emblem in his hands. A helicopter flies up to him and rescues him. Time passes. Chris is sitting in a diner eating steak and chips, deep in depression. A young soldier, who looks like Pierce, approaches him.]

Soldier: Captain. We've received new orders.

Chris: All right. Better get to it, then.

Soldier: Yes, sir!

[Chris gets up from his seat and walks confidently toward the exit of the diner.]
