[In a dark room, lit only by a dozen candles, several black-clad monks perform a ritual. One of them, standing at the altar, holds the girl trying to escape. Another reads a prayer in Spanish.]

[Spanish]
Sumergida en el agua purificadora, envuelta en [...] inmaculado y que aquí te ofrecemos. Oh, señor, que la luz de tu gloria la ilumine hacia tu paraíso. Acepta este cordero, muestra tu poder y acógenos en el paraíso, en tu seno inmaculado. ¡Oh, señor!

[English]
Submerged in the purifying waters, shrouded by an immaculate [...] and that we offer to you. Oh, Lord, let your light shine (over her path) to your paradise. Accept this lamb, show your might and take us into your paradise, into your immaculate bosom. Oh, Lord!

[The girl's mouth is tied and her body is covered with bruises and bloodstains. A monk dressed in an executioner's mask draws his axe over the girl's head. The axe falls and the music drowns the rest of their mumblings. The blood flows down to the altar, which bears the symbol of four bound hands against the moon.]

CAPCOM PRESENTS 

[We see flashbacks from previous games in the series.]

Leon: (offscreen) September 30, 1998… It's a day I'll never forget. The cop inside me died that day. And that night, Raccoon City was wiped out. Thanks to the bioweapons created by Umbrella. Somehow, I made it out. But too many others...weren't so lucky. I was "asked" later to join a top-secret government program. Not that I had a choice. The training, the punishing missions nearly killed me. But at least they kept my mind off everything. If I could just forget what happened that night, the pain—even for a second. This time, it can be different. It has to.

[Nighttime. Leon rides in the car with his head propped up by his arm, along with two policemen. He has an indifferent expression on his face. He pulls out a picture of Ashley, the girl he needs to find.]

Old Policeman: So, tell me, Yanqui (Yankee)… why did you come to this horrible place? As close to nowhere that I've ever seen? (laughs)

Leon: Let's just say—looking for someone.

Old Policeman: That someone must be very important, eh? The chief gave the orders himself. "Help him," he said.

Leon: Well, I'm sure you boys didn't come all the way out here to roast marshmallows. (Old Policeman laughs) ...Or maybe you did.

Old Policeman: You have a strange sense of humor. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Just between us. A lot of people have gone missing around here. And it's been that way for a while now.

Leon: Well, then...should be just another day in the office, right?

Old Policeman: I mean, last week there was a search for some missing hikers. (laughs)

Leon: I'm sure you'll do your best to help me…

[The police car pulls up to a village lost in the woods.]

Young Policeman: I think this is it.

Old Policeman: Nature calls, eh? I'll be right back.

[He gets out of the car and walks toward the woods.]

Old Policeman: (In Spanish) Freezing out here.

Young Policeman: (In Spanish) You drink the whole bar?

Old Policeman: Tssshhr.

[The young policeman takes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket.]

Young Policeman: You smoke?

[He offers a cigarette to Leon, but he just waves. He stares into the night forest. Meanwhile, the policeman stands back and unzips his fly.]

Old Policeman: (In Spanish) This is one hell of a gloomy place.

[He notices someone nearby.]

Old Policeman: (In Spanish) Hey? Anyone there?

[He goes in the direction of the sound he hears to check it out. Meanwhile, the young policeman in the car, waiting for his partner, turns on the radio, which emits only a crackling sound.]

Young Policeman: He sure is taking his time. Did he fall in? Maybe you better go and take a look?

[Leon gets out of the car in silence.]

Young Policeman: I'll watch the car. Wouldn't want to get a parking ticket.

Leon: So much for helping me.

[He goes deeper into the night forest where an abandoned village is located.]

Chapter 1
[After a few minutes of wandering around, Leon never finds the policeman.]

Leon: How far could he have gone?

[Along the way he finds a rotting cow corpse, and then a house with light in the windows. Leon decides to go inside. The house seems empty.]

Leon: Anyone home?

[When Leon walks into the back room of the dirty and dilapidated house, he meets a bearded man who appears to be the owner of the house. The man says something in Spanish.]

Leon: Uh, sorry to barge in like this. (In Spanish) I'm looking for a police officer. Did he come this way?

[The bearded man pays no attention to him and goes over to the stove to put some wood on it. He keeps muttering something to himself in Spanish. Leon looks closely and sees the policeman's badge on the floor. It’s stained in blood. At that moment, a bearded man attacks him from behind with an axe. Leon blocks the blow and throws the man to the floor pulling out his gun. The bearded man breaks his neck as he falls, and he appears to be dead. There are some voices coming from upstairs.]

Leon: This is not good…

[Leon picks up the Hunter's Lodge Key from the bearded man's body and comes to see what he was cooking in his fireplace. The cauldron boils a swamp-colored slurry and gurgles disgustingly.]

Leon: Man, that stinks.

[Leon uses the key to examine the basement of the house. There is clearly something bad going on. There he finds the gory corpse of a policeman. His death was clearly not an easy one. A worried voice comes from the walkie-talkie on his chest. Leon grabs it and answers.]

Leon: I read you! What's your situation!?

[All that comes out of the walkie-talkie is a groan of pain. Leon drops the walkie-talkie.]

Leon: The hell is going on?

[There is a creaking floor from above.]

Leon: What was that?

[The dead bearded man with a broken neck comes down into the basement.]

Leon: No fucking way!

[He immediately opens fire pointing at his head. Ganado dies rather quickly.]

Leon: This just keeps getting worse…

[He goes up to the attic of the house where he finds several pictures pinned to the wall. Leon locks the attic door. In one of the pictures, he sees a girl who looks like Ashley. Leon puts his finger to the portable transmitter in his ear.]

Leon: Roost, this is Condor One.

[A young girl with glasses answers him.]

Hunnigan: Hunnigan here. What's your sitrep?

Leon: The president's daughter—Baby Eagle. It's likely she's in this village.

Hunnigan: Our intel was correct, then. Well done.

Leon: Need a location on a nearby lake. She may have been taken there.

Hunnigan: Copy that. I'll see what I can find.

Leon: Hurry up. Something's happened to the people here. My escorts are—

[He hears footsteps quickly approaching. Someone is breaking through the door to the attic with an axe.]

Leon: Gotta go. Talk later.

[Three villagers enter the room, also obviously ganados.]

Leon: I'll let myself out!

[He jumps out the window and tries to get as far away from the cursed place as possible. His path winds through several dilapidated houses that lead him to the central square of the village, where the locals burn the young policeman on a pole. He screams and writhing in pain. Leon watches it all through binoculars.]

Leon: Holy shit…

[He goes to the central square, trying to be as careful as possible, and kills the inhabitants quietly one by one, but they still manage to find him. He locks himself in one of the houses.]

Leon: Here we go.

[Through the window does he see a distraught ganado wearing a bag mask and carrying a chainsaw walking toward him.]

Leon: You gotta be kidding me.

[Ganados is already setting up ladders to the house.]

Leon: It's my lucky day.

[He tries to barricade himself additionally by moving furniture. Ganados on all sides are doing their best to get in!]

[He checks his ammo supply and finds a shotgun hanging on the wall on the second floor of the house.]

Leon: Oh, nice.

[He begins to fight off the ganados attacking from all sides. To save ammunition he tries to shoot only to stop them, then kicks them with a spin. A full scale battle ensues! The whole village wants Leon dead! He tries not to sit in one place. One of the ganados grabs him and another with a chainsaw runs towards him.]

Leon: You're shitting me!

[He manages to break free of his grip and shoot the ganado with the chainsaw. He continues to fight killing the ganados one by one, but they don't seem to end.]

Leon: You've gotta be kidding me!

[He throws down the ladder with a ganado climbing it with a leg kick.]

Leon: Oh, sorry!

[After some time of fierce fighting, the sound of the bell from the central tower in the square is heard. The ganados instantly cease their interest in Leon and disperse to their homes. They whisper something in Spanish, dropping their weapons.]

Leon: Huh?

[The village is completely empty.]

Leon: Where's everyone going? Bingo?

RESIDENT EVIL 4

[Leon’s coordinator contacts him via transmitter.]

Hunnigan: Roost to Condor One. I've identified a route to the lake. Look for a large windmill. There's a path on the far side of it.

Leon: Windmill. Copy that.

Hunnigan: And be careful. Roost out.

[Leon looks around the village, picking up any useful items left in it and examining the burned corpse of the young policeman.]

Leon: These people are sick.

[He soon finds a path leading to the mill, but a massive iron gate blocks the way.]

Leon: There it is.

[He enters the mill itself and discovers that there are missing wooden cogs in the mechanism.]

Leon: Gotta fix everything myself.

[He begins to search for the lost cog, encountering several ganados along the way. He is attacked by a rather muscular ganado with a huge hammer.]

Leon: God damn.

[He climbs up high and shoots the ganado with his pistol, and when the monster climbs up on him, Leon shoots him right in the head with his shotgun. When the ganado begins to stagger, Leon stabs him in the throat. After noticing the death of his buddy, Leon is attacked from all sides.]

Leon: Shit!

[His knife breaks in the fight, but he manages to find the wooden cog. He returns to the mechanism in the windmill and inserts the found cog into it. The triggered mechanism raises the gate. Leon walks through it and follows the path that leads him to the lake shore.]

Leon: This the place?

[He kicks the padlocked door with his foot.]

Leon: What's that noise?

[Leon pushes aside a closet from behind which sounds can be heard. In the secret room he discovers a ganado, who he quickly kills with a shot to the head. On the floor next to the ganado he sees a hatch that turns out to be hastily boarded up with planks, which Leon quickly tears off with his hands and descends into the basement. There he finds a bound man with his mouth taped shut. Leon sharply rips the duct tape off the man's face.]

Man: That hurts, you know?

Leon: Seemed like you really wanted to talk.

Man: How observant, señor. Now, say—you got a smoke?

Leon: You know, those things will kill you.

Man: Oh, well, maybe just untie me then?

[Suddenly he notices something and gets scared.]

Man: ¡Joder! (Fuck!) Not this guy.

[Leon shines his flashlight in the direction the man looks and notices a huge old man with a long, thick beard and wearing a hat.]

Leon: Who are you? OK, stop right there!

[The old man knocks the gun out of Leon's hands and throws it on the boxes like Leon weighs no more than a cat. The old man pulls out a syringe. He injects something into Leon while he is unconscious.]

Chapter 2
[Leon wakes up. His eyes are foggy and he cannot see clearly. A monk in a robe is leaning over him.]

Monk: Sacrificial lamb. You will receive our most sacred body. It begins now.

[Leon completely comes to his senses. He finds himself handcuffed to the ceiling in an abandoned factory. Next to him is a man he tried to save.]

Leon: Oh, what the fuck?

Man: Hey, stop it! Oye, Yanqui (Yankee), got a name?

Leon: Leon.

Man: Quiet type, eh? I'm Luis Serra. And guess—you, me—picked the wrong spot to vacation, eh?

[The chain to which they are chained to the ceiling is long enough to allow some freedom of movement, but it is one for two.]

Luis: Hey, stop it! You move, I move... and I'm beat up enough as it is! I can see your thinking. Bet you've been in spots like this before. My guess… you're here looking for someone? One more guess. Maybe... some missing señorita? 

Leon: A young girl?

[Leon pulls the chain to pull Luis closer to him.]

Leon: Talk. Now.

Luis: All right. See, I heard chatter about moving a señorita.

Leon: Moving her. Where?

Luis: Who knows? But later, saw some men dragging someone… to the old church.

[As he speaks, Leon pulls the chain to break it off the ceiling. When he succeeds, Luis falls to the floor.]

Luis: Mierda… Hanging with you? Not healthy—

[They are attacked by a ganado. Leon uses the chain to tie his throat so that he is in the center of the chain and cannot attack either Leon or Luis with his axe. Leon pulls the chain to break the ganado's neck. Luis quickly takes advantage of the situation and pulls a key out of the ganado's pocket, undoing his handcuffs.]

Leon: Hey, we're not done here!

Luis: Later, amigo!

[He drops the key and runs away. Leon unlocks his handcuffs.]

Leon: Shit. They took my gear.

[He uses his secret earpiece for radio communication.]

Leon: Condor One to Roost. I've located Baby Eagle. It sounds like she's being kept in some church.

Hunnigan: Great! That's good news.

Leon: I heard it from this guy I met. Said his name is Luis Serra. There was something fishy about him. I need you run a background check.

Hunnigan: Wilco, Condor One. I'll see what I can find. In the meantime, make your way to that church.

Leon: Right. I'm probably due for confession anyway. Condor One out.

[Leon finds a kitchen knife and leaves his confinement. He carefully kills the ganados one by one by attacking them from behind. He sees where his hideout is hidden through a hole in the wall, but he has yet to get there.]

Leon: Hey, that's my gear.

[He kills some ganados and finds a way to get to the warehouse and take his equipment.]

Leon: I'll be taking these back.

[As Leon approaches the exit, he notices a strange man in a robe with hood and in a mask with a large bag behind him.]

Man: Over here, stranger.

Leon: Who is that?

[Leon goes outside and finds that the strange man has an open store nearby, marked by a burning purple pole.]

Merchant: Let's do some business then, ey! Welcome! A job well done deserves payment in kind. Got some rare things on sale, stranger. That's good work if I do say so myself. Pleasant travels. What's that? How have we procured these curiosities? Heheheh, you don't wanna know, mate. Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. A deal well struck, heheh! A bit more space never hurt anyone. Perfect size for you, stranger. Wish your enemies sweet dreams from afar with a bullet straight through their heads, mwahaha! Go on, take this as well. Free of charge! All yours, stranger. So that's a request, done and dusted, eh? Good stuff, mate. Haha, well done! You've proven yourself reliable. Well then. What can I do you for? Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! A wise choice, mate. Its ammo will penetrate just about anything.

[Having completely upgraded his equipment and closed the contracts he had on hand, Leon continues on his way in search of the church where Ashley is presumably being held.]

Leon: The hell am I?

[He enters a small coastal settlement of dilapidated, hastily built houses. There he encounters the locals. A fierce fight ensues.]

Leon: All right. Outta the way! Sorry, must've slipped. They keep coming!

[After the fight, he returns to the Merchant.]

Merchant: Hello, stranger. We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend. Good as new. Anything else I can 'elp you with? Come back anytime.

[Leon finds the key to the gate in the form of a strange hexagonal emblem. Soon he is attacked again.]

Leon: Oh... Break's over, I suppose!

[On the way up the stone stairs, he notices dead bodies.]

Leon: Well, that stinks.

[He is attacked by a ganado with a chainsaw. He comes straight down the stairs, blocking the way.]

Leon: Fuck!

[Leon deflects the ganado attack with a knife and throws him back, then fires his shotgun several times.]

Leon: Are you even feeling this?

[Moving farther away, Leon shoots him with a sniper rifle.]

Leon: Finally.

[After climbing the stone steps, Leon comes to a large house. From the outside it looks ordinary, like all the others, but inside the house is very luxurious - mahogany, antique furniture, wallpaper and other joys of aristocratic life.]

Leon: Not too shabby. Someone is showing up their neighbors.

[He finds a lot of old photographs scattered on the table.]

Leon: Old photos…

[He also finds a glass ball, after which he goes up to the second floor and enters the bedroom. There he finds a note.]

[Village Records Vol. 3]
Date: October 10
The weather has been strange of late. The wheat withers and the cows grow thin.

Date: December 8
There are signs of famine. It is true, we lack the means to work the fields, but Lord Saddler's orders are absolute.

Date: January 30 
30 people have starved to death. 5 cows will be slaughtered.

Date: March 11
The patriarchs gather to cast lots. 6 more chosen for Lord Saddler.

Date: April
8 more today.

Date:
4 more today.

Date:
11 more today.

Date:
Two outsiders got lost and wandered into the village. We took them to the altar for the ritual. No need to cast lots today.

[Next to the note hangs a large portrait of the very monk Leon saw after he was injected. Apparently it is Lord Saddler himself. As Leon is about to leave the room a bearded old man stands in his way. Leon shoots him several times, but it has no effect. The old man grabs Leon by the throat. He lifts him above the floor and examines him carefully. Leon's eyes begin to fill with blood.]

Old Man: Your blood has accepted the Gift.

[At that moment, someone shoots the old man in the head through the window, knocking the hat off his head. He picks it up and goes to deal with the intruder.]

Leon: Gift… in my blood?

Chapter 3
[Leon's transmitter turns on.]

Hunnigan: Roost to Condor One. I've got that intel you requested on Luis Serra. It seems he used to be a researcher for Umbrella.

Leon: Umbrella? I should've left him in that bag to rot.

Hunnigan: I'm sending you the details. Take a look, but Baby Eagle is your priority.

Leon: Copy that. Making my way to the church. Condor One out.

[He takes the special key and leaves the house, heading for the locked gate. On the way, he hears a piteous howl and finds a dog caught in a trap.]

Leon: You too, huh?

[He slides the flaps of the trap so the dog can get free.]

Leon: Take care of yourself, buddy.

[The dog runs away, and Leon opens the gate with the key. After walking a bit down a crooked, untended path, he enters another village quite similar to the previous one, but this village has a lot of palisades. When Leon enters the central square, the bell tower suddenly explodes.]

Leon: What!?

[He is attacked by several demonic-looking dogs with huge fangs. He quickly kills one of them with a pistol shot.]

Leon: Next?

[He kills all the dogs and begins to explore his surroundings. In the depths of the village he discovers another temple.]

[Iluminados 4:9]

Sleep well and flourish, dear child.

As your body grows, your mothers shall sew new smallclothes.

At seven quintal of wheat and half a bull a day. you have outgrown your pen.

Flourish, dear child, for the sake of your brothers and sisters who cannot.

[When he leaves the temple he meets again the Merchant who has settled here as well - he has a separate table and some supplies.]

Merchant: I have some new goods that might interest you. Welcome! Got some rare things on sale, stranger. There's some things money can't buy. You've got a soft spot for treasure, ey? Yeah, that's the way. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! I knew you were a go-getter! Why not try your hand at a new gun, stranger? Might save your life… Not only will you need cash but you'll need guts to buy that weapon. Information is a commodity these days. Easy work.

[Leon soon manages to find the church.]

Leon: A church... I made it.

[He opens the gate to the courtyard, but the gate to the church itself is locked with a strange circular lock.]

Leon: Damn it.

[He calls his coordinator.]

Leon: Condor One to Roost. The church is sealed up.

Hunnigan: And Baby Eagle?

Leon: Negative, nothing yet. But they sure do have this place locked up tight.

Hunnigan: I see. I can think of one reason they'd want to do so.

Leon: Oh she's here, that's for sure. I'll find a way in. Condor One out.

[He examines the church from all sides and finds a small room where he discovers Ashley's photograph as well as a map of the area.]

Leon: The lake... Let's hope for no more surprises.

[Leon goes further and discovers a small settlement. Located on a platform suspended from a rock. As the sign indicates, the road through this settlement leads to a lake. Leon is immediately attacked by locals.]

Leon: They keep coming! Outta the way!

[As he approaches the lake, he discovers a large, fenced-in palisade. Next to the tall palisade is a huge hammer.]

Leon: Good luck finding someone big enough to use this thing.

[He goes further and through an underground tunnel enters another Merchant's store, located in the basement.]

Merchant: So that's a request, done and dusted, eh? Good stuff, mate. 

Leon: There are enough weapons here to get a party going.

Merchant: Good stuff, stranger! What can I interest you in? My back is killin' me. Years haven't been kind to us, I suppose. I'll buy almost anything. Well done, stranger! Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend. We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend. Come back anytime. Gun rhymes with fun for a reason, stranger! 

[Leon decides to use the shooting range on the second floor to hone his skills.]

Merchant: Welcome, stranger. I believe this is your first time 'aving a go at target practice. There's only one rule—shoot the targets as they pop up. Simple enough, am I right? If you do well, I'll make it worth your while. Knick knacks and whatnot. Anyway, have fun, mate! Rely too much on a single weapon and you'll find yourself out of ammo, mate. Begin! Brilliant! That's the stuff! Superb shot! Reload! Brilliant! That's it! It's a bullet bonanza! Fire everything you've got! That's your lot! A perfect performance!? Are you for real, mate!? Begin! Superb shot! You're an artist, mate! Oh, beautiful! Brilliant! Reload! Double kill! You're an artist, mate! And that's the game! My... I-I'm speechless. Begin! That's the stuff! Reload! You're an artist, mate! Double kill! Brilliant! You've been waitin' for it. A flood of targets! You're an artist, mate! Oh, beautiful! And that's the game! Some of the targets are, well, particularly sturdy. One shot won't be enough for those, I'd wager! Do come again, stranger. 

[For successful shooting he receives special tokens from the Merchant, which can be exchanged for useful items. Leon leaves the shooting range. Next to the stairs leading to the second floor he finds a small chest with the first piece of hexagonal key inside. Leon walks through the double doors and enters the pier by the lake. He looks around with his binoculars and sees two ganados on a boat throwing a corpse into the water.]

Leon: Fuck.

[The corpse is immediately eaten by some huge fish. Leon is a little stunned by this turn of events.]

Leon: The hell was that?

[Continuing to look around through binoculars he discovers a boat anchorage at the other end of the lake.]

Leon: Looks like there's something over there.

[He can also see a huge castle in the distance.]

Leon: Damn, look at the size of that...

[He goes down to the water and tries to start the boat that the ganados came in, but there is no fuel in the tank.]

Leon: C'mon, fill the tank when you're done! All right.

[He looks around in search of fuel, but falls into a swamp by walking on rotten planks.]

Leon: Shit. God damn it.

[A fat ganado with a sledgehammer and wearing a bull mask is waiting for him in the swamp.]

Leon: Huh!

[Leon shoots him in the head with a shotgun.]

Leon: One down.

[While exploring the swamp, Leon completes the tasks he received from the Merchant and finds several useful items. He also finds a canister of fuel, as well as a new piece of hexagonal key.]

Leon: Sorry, must've slipped. Last one. This is what I'm talking about. All right. They keep coming!

[Leon returns to the Merchant to turn in his completed tasks and renew his equipment.]

Merchant: Ah, I see you took care of a request. Well done. Nice work! Well then. What can I do you for? What's that? How have we procured these curiosities? Heheheh, you don't wanna know, mate. Heheh, a wise choice. I know I say that a lot, but I mean it. Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Perfect. You're a real professional. Easy work. Moldin' a weapon to suit your specific needs, oho! It's a thing of beauty, innit? Dazzled, are you? Our craftsmanship demands no less. Will that be all, then? Can't sell what I don't have. Don't get yourself killed now, haha.

[Having finished with his equipment, Leon goes outside. He fuels the boat and sets sail. In the middle of the lake, the boat's old motor suddenly stops. Leon tries to start it, but to no avail. The boat starts to rock and we already know what exactly is rocking it. The monster fish jumps out of the water and pulls the rope from the boat. Leon takes advantage of the situation and starts throwing an infinite number of harpoons at it.]

Leon: Think you can swallow me whole, huh?

[The monstrous fish fails to break free and swim away under the water.]

Leon: Where'd you go?

[The battle continues. Throwing endless harpoons at the monster, he kills it. A gigantic pool of blood spreads across the water. Leon himself, meanwhile, seems uninjured, but he begins to vomit blood. He loses consciousness falling to the bottom of the boat. 

Chapter 4
[As Leon sleeps, he sees the monk again, wearing a black robe and carrying a staff, the stem of which appears to be alive.]

Saddler: Sacrificial lamb. You will receive our most sacred body. It begins now. When day breaks, you too will join our covenant. To share in my holy blessing… forever.

[Saddler extends his hand to Leon, from which some worms crawl out. Leon's head begins to hurt badly, and he screams in pain as he wakes up. He takes a boat to the dock on the other side of the lake, where he radioed headquarters.]

Leon: Condor One to Roost. Do you read me?

Hunnigan: Condor One!? You've been radio silent for three hours. Are you all right?

Leon: Yeah… I'm fine. Won't let it happen again.

Hunnigan: And the church?

Leon: Still looking for whatever "key" I need.

Hunnigan: Copy that. I'm glad you're OK. Roost out.

[He goes out into the street where it is already night and walks to the caves. Along the way he meets several ganados. He shoots one of them in the head with a sniper rifle and a worm comes out.]

Leon: What the...? What the fuck...

[In the depths of the cave, he finds an altar with a symbol of four hands on it.]

Leon: What is this place? Some kind of shrine? Same mark from the church.

[Next to the altar, there is a puzzle in the form of a sect's sign. In the center of the puzzle is a certain object.]

Leon: Is this the "key"?

[A little farther away he sees a map on which several places are marked.]

Leon: It's the lake.

[He decides to explore the places marked on the map. He sails around the narrow corridors of the cave collecting useful items. Leon also finds another Merchant's store.]

Merchant: I have some new goods that might interest you. Welcome! Got some rare things on sale, stranger. You'll get some bang for your buck, I guarantee it. Information is a commodity these days. Without the necessary funds, I'm afraid we don't have a deal! That won't cover it, I'm afraid. Thank you! Will that be all, then? Don't get yourself killed now, haha. A deal well struck, heheh! A decent size. But size ain't everything, am I right? See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away.

[Leon continues to explore the underground lake by boat.]

Leon: Ah, it's locked. All right. Here you go! Give me a break already. You're serious?

[He finds the last piece of the key as well as all the puzzle pieces - the stone heads - and returns to the Merchant.]

Merchant: Nothing but the finest wares! Welcome! What can I interest you in? This is what I'm talking about! Fine work! Without the necessary funds, I'm afraid we don't have a deal! Haha, well done! You've proven yourself reliable. Anything else I can 'elp you with? My back is killin' me. Years haven't been kind to us, I suppose. Heheh, a wise choice. I know I say that a lot, but I mean it. Good as new. There you are, as you wished. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… Well then. What can I do you for? Pleasant travels.

[Leon sets the found stone heads on stone hands and solves the puzzle. He gets his hands on a key in the form of a sect emblem. He decides to report it to headquarters.]

Leon: Condor One to Roost. I found the key to the church.

Hunnigan: Copy that. Now, go get Baby Eagle.

Leon: Right, no time to chat. I'm going in. Condor One out.

[He heads back to the church and passes through a small fenced arena where he recently found a huge sledgehammer. Suddenly all exits from the arena are closed by gates falling from thick timbers.]

Leon: Shit.

[Standing on top of the rock, a shaman in a red robe in a cow skull on his head waves his staff and reads a spell. A metal door with a wooden bolt located on the far side of the arena begins to be violently broken into. The wooden bolt gradually begins to crack, succumbing to the mighty blows. The final blow knocks the metal door off its hinges and it flies away, narrowly missing Leon. Out of the clouds of dust a giant, resembling a mountain troll, emerges toward him.]

Jesus Christ! Whoa! God damn, you're a big boy.

[The unequal battle begins. Leon uses the most powerful weapons in his arsenal.]

Leon: Here you go! Present for you.

[After a while, the same dog that he recently rescued from the trap jumps off the cliff. It growls furiously at the giant and joins the fight.]

Leon: Hey, it's that dog. You wanna help? Cause I could use it!

[When Leon inflicts a certain number of wounds to the giant, a worm comes out of his back.]

Leon: You got worms too?

[Leon quickly realizes that this is a vulnerable point and starts shooting at it. However, the giant is not going to die so quickly!]

Leon: You're kidding me. Shit! 

[The dog bites the giant's Achilles tendon and he throws it aside, but loses his balance and hits his head on the rock, covering himself with rocks and losing consciousness for a while.]

Leon: That's what I'm talking about! Good boy!

[Leon does a little extra damage to the giant, but the fight is not over yet.]

Leon: Shit! C'mon!

[He still manages to defeat the troll-like creature. The giant falls to the ground.]

Leon: God damn... I was almost a pancake. OK, let's get to that church.

[After collecting all the useful items in the area, he approaches the dog that sits on the rock.]

Leon: Thanks, bud.

[He continues on his way to the church. When he reaches it and opens the cunning lock, he pushes open the heavy double doors and enters the altar.]

Leon: Ashley Graham!? I'm here to help!

[Not getting an answer, he begins to look around. The church seems rather strange, with many iron bars and various locking mechanisms, as if it were not built for prayer, but rather to keep someone out. Leon solves the altar puzzle and climbs higher.]

Leon: Ashley? You in there?

[At the back of the church he finds a dark room locked. He picks up his gun and goes inside.]

Leon: Ashley? Ashley Graham, are you in here?

[He is attacked by a girl in a red jacket. She tries to hit him with a candlestick.]

Ashley: Just let me go.

Leon: Listen.

[Without letting Leon finish, she attacks him again. He intercepts the candlestick and takes it away.]

Leon: Easy with that! My name's Leon. I'm here on the president's orders, and—

[Looking around like a hunted animal, the girl realizes that the door is open and quickly runs away.]

Leon: That went well.

[However, the girl did not manage to escape far.]

Leon: Hey. It's dangerous outside. You need to listen to me—

Ashley: What is that? Over there?

[She points to the window. A whole crowd of ganados with pitchforks and torches approaches the church. Leon and the girl's head begins to hurt. They hear Saddler's voice.]

Saddler: Pursue them. The lost lambs are escaping. Deliver unto them... salvation.

[The ganado crowd is already approaching the gate.]

Chapter 5
[The girl is seriously frightened.]

Ashley: What do we do?

Leon: Your father trusts me. And I need you to trust me too, and do exactly as I say. I'm gonna get you home safe.

Ashley: OK, Leon.

[Ganados enters the church. Leon and Ashley hide on the second floor.]

Leon: All right, let's get the hell out of here.

[They begin to move slowly toward the exit, squatting and talking in whispers. Leon finds a pink flip phone with a broken screen on the stone floor.]

Ashley: Seriously? I just bought this.

Leon: Get the ladder.

Ashley: Me? Um, OK.

[They go up to the attic.]

Ashley: What do we do? There's no way out.

[Leon finds an open window, and after looking around, he jumps out of it.]

Ashley: No way.

Leon: It's OK. I've got you. Hey, trust me!

[Ashley cautiously climbs out and sits on the bottom of the window, daring herself to jump. Overcoming the fear, she leaps awkwardly. Leon catches her.]

Ashley: Th-Thanks…

[Leon decides to report to headquarters on a successful mission.]

Leon: Roost, I've secured Baby Eagle.

Hunnigan: Copy that. Is she OK?

Leon: Affirmative.

Hunnigan: Well done, Condor One. I'll dispatch a chopper ASAP. I'm sending you the coordinates for the extraction point. Make your way there. And don't let anything happen to Baby Eagle.

Leon: Copy that.

Hunnigan: Hurry, the weather is getting worse. Roost out.

[He completes the connection and turns to Ashley.]

Leon: Like I said, it's dangerous. Stay close.

Ashley: OK.

[Ahead of him he sees several ganados.]

Leon: OK. It's all right. With me.

Ashley: OK.

Leon: You're serious? They're coming. Get behind me!

Ashley: Oh, god! What is wrong with these people!?

Leon: Give me some space.

Ashley: OK.

Leon: Come on!

Ashley: No prob.

[They continue on to the evacuation point. Leon shoots off the ganado and Ashley hides behind him. On the way, they visit the Merchant's store.]

Merchant: I have something I think you'll like. Welcome! Oh, what're ya buyin'? A deal well struck, heheh! Come back anytime.

Ashley: Hey, can we take a break?

Leon: Sorry, we need to keep moving.

Ashley: Got it…

[The weather gradually gets worse. The wind begins to increase.]

Leon: Hunnigan was right about the weather…

[They pass through a ruined village, where they are attacked from all sides. Leon has to use a combination of stealth and aggressive attack. Ashley tries to stay out of the way.]

Leon: Shit! Come on. I need you to open it from the other side. It's open. Good work. Damn! I knew it. Next?

Ashley: Seriously, this can't be happening...

Leon: C'mon! Shit!

[One of the ganados manages to bite Leon.]

Ashley: Leon, no!

Leon: Twisty son of a bitch.

[He blows his head off with a shotgun blast. It starts to rain. They continue on their way.]

Ashley: I'm definitely gonna catch a cold.

[As Leon and Ashley approach the wooden suspension bridge, they are chased by a mob of ganados with torches. The door of the house at the other end of the bridge opens and Luis looks out.]

Luis: Hey! Over here! Come on!

[Leon and Ashley run behind the gate that surrounds the house. Leon locks the iron bar and then, as Leon and Ashley run into the house, Luis closes the door behind them.]

Leon: You!

[He walks threateningly toward him. Luis backs away.]

Luis: Hey... Listen, about earlier, I—

Leon: Yeah, about that…

[He presses him against the wall getting ready to punch him.]

Luis: Hey. I see you found your "missing señorita."

Ashley: The "señorita" has a name, and it's Ashley. And you are?

Luis: Name's Luis. Encantado. (Charmed.)

Leon: Great. We all have names. Now then—Who are you? And what're you doing here?

Luis: Very good questions, unfortunately…

[The ganados somehow make their way through the locked gate. Leon turns to Ashley.]

Leon: Hide. Now!

Luis: In that case, here, help me.

[Together they lift a huge dresser, behind which is hidden a hole in the wall.]

Leon: Ashley, quick! Over here! Go!

[A frightened Ashley squats and crawls into the hole. Luis pulls out a pistol resembling a Mauser C96.]

Luis: OK. It's game time. 

[They start defending the house.]

Luis: Hordes of them against two of us. Oh, and let's not forget—this mob is made up of monsters. You done warming up? Hope you stretched!

[While Luis is flapping his tongue, Leon nails up the windows with boards.]

Leon: Yeah. Now, if you'd shut up, we'd be good to go.

Luis: Lighten up, cowboy.

Leon: Give me a break already.

Luis: I've been waiting, hero boy! Perfect timing! Give me a hand! One down. It's all you! They keep coming! Look! We've got a big one on our hands!

Leon: Little busy at the moment!

Luis: Hey, our guests will think we're rude! So much for service with a smile, huh! But I guess bullets work just as well.

Leon: Stay focused!

[After a while, he manages to kill most of the attackers while using up all his ammunition.]

Leon: None left!

[New ganados start climbing into the house. Suddenly the door swings open and Ashley appears.]

Ashley: Leon! This way, hurry!

[Leon and Luis run after Ashley. They are pursued by several ganados, but Leon, with a well-aimed shot at the gin that controls the lift of the massive wooden gate, cuts off the pursuers' path, breaking the bones of the first and luckiest of them. The heroes take a moment to catch their breath. Ashley begins to cough up blood.]

Leon: Ashley!?

Ashley: Wh-What's happening to me?

[Luis approaches the girl.]

Luis: Ashley. Is this the first time you've coughed up blood like this?

Leon: You wanna start explaining?

Luis: The cough, the blood—it's caused by something called a… "plaga." (plague, pest, infestation) OK. You saw those "people," right? Well, you have the same thing inside you. The same thing that made them like that. This, what you're experiencing, these symptoms… They're only the beginning.

Ashley: I don't want to become like them.

Luis: You are, well, lucky. You see, at this early stage, the parasite—the plaga. It is possible to remove it… with a surgical procedure. And all you need is some know-how. And, oh yeah—the right equipment.

[He pulls open the shirt on his chest, revealing the scar.]

Leon: Wait. You, too?

Luis: No worries. See, I have a plan. But you're going to have to trust me.

[Leon looks at Ashley, then hesitantly nods.]

Luis: Great! We're partners then!

Leon: Hey, why are you—

Luis: No time for any questions. The clock is ticking!

Leon: Why are you helping us?

Luis: Because it makes me feel better. Let's leave it at that. I will contact you later.

[He leaves.]

Chapter 6
[Luis walks along the road playing with a Zippo lighter. He meets a beautiful Asian girl standing on her heels at the top of a small hill.]

Luis: Hey. Got a smoke?

Ada: I do. The kind you like. Now where's the "Amber"?

Luis: Unfortunately, it's not on me at the moment. And you really should be telling me what a good job I did.

[He tries to climb the hill to Ada.]

Luis: Busted my ass and managed to hide it right before I got caught. Which is why I'm still alive!

[His shoe slips on the wet rock and he slides down.]

Ada: The deal was we get you out of here when you deliver the Amber. No Amber? No "protection," Luis.

Luis: Such a stickler for details, huh Ada? OK, then. I'll go get it now. How about that?

[He holds out his hand, asking for help. After some thought, Ada extends her hand and helps him up the hill. Luis shakes off his soiled pants.]

Luis: And I do have something else I need to get too.

[Meanwhile, Hunnigan contacts Leon.]

Leon: This is Roost. I've got some bad news, Condor One.

Hunnigan: With the weather like this, the chopper can't make its approach. Can you stand by until it clears?

Leon: Negative. Too dangerous. We're gonna get out of here and find someplace safe.

Hunnigan: I'm sorry, I wish I could do more to help.

Leon: Don't worry about it. We'll swim home if we have to. Condor One out.

[He turns to Ashley.]

Leon: Let's go.

Ashley: What's... What's gonna happen to me?

Leon: Right now, let's just focus on getting out of here.

Ashley: Yeah. Right.

[They visit the Merchant to replenish supplies.]

I've got some new items in stock, heheh. Come, take a look! Welcome! Got some rare things on sale, stranger. We like our herbs, we do. Heal a man, kill a man. They do it all, heheh! Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. A deal well struck, heheh! Thank you! Ah, that there's a real boomstick, mate. It'll reduce your target to a bloody pulp! Information is a commodity these days. Stocking up while you can? Wise choice. Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. Your weapons are in good hands, mate. I'll see you right. Dazzled, are you? Our craftsmanship demands no less. There you are, as you wished.

[They walk on, wandering into a mountainous area divided by wooden partitions. There are armed ganados everywhere.]

Leon: We've got company. Keep moving, but quietly. Got it?

Ashley: OK… I’ll… I’ll try…

[Leon uses stealth and his trusty sniper rifle to take out enemies one by one.]

Leon: All right.

[There are traps set everywhere, but not very skillfully, which makes it easy for Leon to avoid them. When he goes inside one of the houses, a muscular ganado attacks him from around the corner and starts strangling him.]

Ashley: Leon!

Leon: Guess we're doing this!

[He kills him by stabbing him in the throat. Leon and Ashley move on, but the enemies are nowhere to be seen.]

Leon: Sure is quiet.

[They find a large locked gate.]

Leon: Looks like I need something. All right. Won't open...

[He begins to explore his surroundings. sensing that it might be dangerous to go further, he asks Ashley to climb into a wooden box.]

Leon: Stay here.

Ashley: What!?

[Leon doesn't answer anything.]

Ashley: O-OK.

[She climbs into the box and closes the lid. Leon walks over to the shelf where the gate handle lies at that moment two chainsaws crash into the wall! Leon does a nifty somersault to save his stomach from the sudden painful surgical procedure.]

Leon: Great.

[After sawing the wall, two crazy old ganados burst into the room with their faces covered in rags and chainsaws in their hands. One of the old women picks up the handle.]

Leon: Sorry, didn't realize that was yours.

[He escapes!]

Leon: I am flattered, but I'm a one-lady type of guy.

[However, there are already a lot of ganados gathered outside! The situation becomes extremely dangerous.]

Leon: They keep coming! One down.

[Leon begins to fight. Terrified Ashley leaves her hideout. She is immediately grabbed by one of the ganados.]

Ashley: Leon! Leon, help!

Leon: Hey!

[He fires his rifle at the fleeing ganado with Ashley on his shoulder and kills him.]

Leon: You hurt? Hang in there!

Ashley: No, I'm OK.

Leon: Come on!

Ashley: All right.

Leon: Stay down, all right?

[The second crazy old ganado woman is still stalking Leon!]

Ashley: Holy...

[Leon kills her with a sniper rifle.]

Leon: Here you go!

[Soon he manages to finish off the remaining ganados as well. He picks up the handle and slides it into the gate.]

Leon: Are you hurt?

Ashley: No, I'm... I'm OK, I guess.

Leon: You did well back there. Seems this isn't your first time running from creeps.

Ashley: I can't tell if that's meant to be a compliment.

[Leon opens the gate.]

Leon: All right. Come on.

Ashley: OK.

[Suddenly the old man with a long black beard and wearing a hat that Leon had seen earlier approaches her from behind. He grabs Ashley by the arm.]

Leon: Ashley!

[He stabs the tall old man in the arm and he lets the girl go, then hits Leon with a powerful blow, so hard that he flies away several meters.]

Ashley: Leon!

[The old man locks the gate.]

Old Man: Your soul requires cleansing.

[He bends the metal deadbolt with his bare hands to prevent the door from opening.]

Old Man: Come, child.

Leon: Ashley, run! Hurry!

[They run away from the creepy old man running through a small village full of ganados. Ashley is horrified by what is happening.]

Ashley: Nooo!

Old Man: There is no escape.

Ashley: Leon! 

Leon: Don't worry about them! One down. The bridge!

Ashley: Leon! Watch out!

Leon: This way!

[They run onto a flimsy wooden bridge. Ashley's shoe gets stuck between the boards.]

Leon: You OK?

Ashley: I'm stuck!

Leon: We need to go!

[He shoots an axe-wielding ganado who runs up. As he falls on the bridge a distinctive cracking sound is heard, indicating that the bridge is about to collapse.]

Leon: You gotta be kidding me.

Ashley: I'm good!

Leon: Then run!

[They run as fast as they can, barely making it to the other side. A creepy old man with a hat looks at them, standing on the opposite side.]

Leon: Close one.

Ashley: Yeah.

Leon: Listen. You're the one he wants. If we see him again, you run.

Ashley: Wh-What about you?

Leon: I'll do my job.

[They find the Merchant's store and replenish supplies.]

Stranger! Oooh, I'll pay a pretty penny for that. We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see…

[They leave the bidding room itself and enter a dilapidated stall nearby, finding themselves on a narrow platform under a roof.]

Ashley: Be careful.

[The rotten planks break under Leon's feet and he falls down to a creepy old man with a black beard who happens to be there.]

Ashley: Leon!

[Leon quickly rises to his feet and assumes a firing position. He fires his pistol into the old man's shoulder.]

Old Man: Cease your pointless struggling. Abandon your body to the will of our God.

Leon: You're a shitty missionary, you know that?

[He shoots a few more times. Ignoring this, the old man comes up and picks up his hat from the floor.]

Old Man: Oh, Almighty! Grant me the strength to crush your enemies.

Leon: Son of a bitch! Ashley, run!

Ashley: OK!

[He kicks a barrel of fuel up to the old man.]

Leon: Hasta luego! (Goodbye!)

[He shoots the barrel. The stall catches fire, but the old man again seems unimpressed by Leon's actions. His skin is charred, exposing his monstrous nature. The old man's spine has lengthened, and scorpion-like tails have grown from his shoulder blades.]

Old Man: God, thank you for our gift!

Leon: You wanna get ugly? Let's get ugly!

[We learn that the old man's name is Méndez.]

Méndez: Behold! The miracle!

[Leon aggressively attacks him with his shotgun, as he has no ability to plan a fight in such a confined space. When Méndez’ plaga shows itself, Leon stabs it with a knife.]

Leon: That had to have done something.

Méndez: To think you could be this foolish. You heretic!

[Leon manages to separate Méndez with shots to his thin spine. It does not kill him, however.]

Leon: Guess your tapdancing days are over!

[Méndez uses his scorpion tails and clings to the edges of the stall.]

Méndez: Your time is nigh. Burn in His flame!

Leon: Back at you!

Méndez: Receive your judgment!

Leon: Hey! Watch where you're swinging those things!

Méndez: Lord, grant me your strength!

Leon: Running out of options, huh?

Méndez: Die! Die! You will die! No escape!

[Leon defeats him and Méndez falls to the floor of the stall.]

Méndez: Lord Saddler!

[He dies and his eye falls out. At this time, Ashley is running outside, looking for a way to open the door.]

Ashley: Leon!

[She smashes the window with a stool.]

Ashley: Leon, quick! This place is coming down!

[Leon, meanwhile, picks up the eye.]

Leon: Give my regards to your god.

Ashley: Hey! You coming? Leon! Hey, come on! It's dangerous! Leon, hurry!

[Leon jumps out the window.]

Ashley: You're welcome?

Leon: Thanks. This fire's bound to catch their attention. Let's keep moving.

Ashley: Uh, Leon? I'm not going to turn into one of them, right?

Leon: I won't let that happen. I promise.

[They look for a way to leave the village and approach the rising bridge that leads to the castle. When they leave the village, the bridge mysteriously begins to rise.]

Ashley: What's going on?

Leon: Well, at least we don't have to worry about being followed. Come on.

Chapter 7
[Luis contacts Leon through the transmitter.]

Luis: Hola. Luis here. You guys still around?

Leon: Well, I wanted to go home, but Ashley just had to see this castle first.

Luis: Perfect, because I have a present I want to give you. Medicine that will help to suppress the progress of your...problem.

Leon: Where do we go?

Luis: Let's see... Come to the courtyard inside of the castle. We can meet up there. ¡Ciao!

Leon: All right, Ashley. Luis just said—

Ashley: I got it. Guess we better get going?

[They walk into the Merchant's store, who has made his way here by mysterious means.]

Merchant: Got some new wares, stranger. You're in for a treat. Welcome! I've got something new for you, mate. All my wares are in tip-top shape, I assure you. Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. A deal well struck, heheh! Come back anytime. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! Heheheheh, thank you. Don't get yourself killed now, haha. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! Thank you! I see you have an eye for things. Gun's not just about shootin'. It's about reloadin'. You'll know what I'm talkin' about. Come back anytime. Thank you! Let us know when you've made some room. That cash in your pocket or your life? Easy choice, mate. This gun turns heads into pumpkins, mate. Take this for a rampage through the patch, heheh! Come back anytime. Heheheheh, thank you. That's an exemplary firearm right there, stranger. Not the best, sure, but she'll make you an ideal companion. See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away. We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend. I don't always have this in stock, stranger. Pleasant travels.

[Leon and Ashley move on. Finding a hole in the wall, Leon examines the courtyard through binoculars. On a balcony at the far end of the castle he sees a shaman in a red robe, who has set the giant on him.]

Leon: Huh. Courtyard's gotta be through that gate. Don't think our hosts are gonna roll out the red carpet. What is that? Guessing it's not for decoration.... Crossbows, huh. Something tells me they don't want to be friends. Things just keep getting better.

Ashley: What're they—

Leon: Shh. Keep your voice down.

[He begins to look around the castle and at first there seems to be no one around. Ashley cautiously follows him. Soon Leon is spotted by a fanatic in an iron mask. He shouts to summon his brothers. The fight begins. The fanatics are armed with crossbows with fire arrows, and some of them also wear iron masks that prevent them from being killed quickly with a headshot.]

Leon: Give me a break already.

[When Leon approaches one of the towers, he notices a catapult on an elevator through an iron grate.]

Ashley: No way! They have catapults!?

Leon: I guess this is their idea of a warm welcome! You OK?

Ashley: Yeah.

Leon: They keep coming! You hurt?

Ashley: No, I'm OK.

[Fanatics fire catapults into the courtyard trying to kill Leon.]

Leon: Shit! You're serious? Ashley! You all right?

Ashley: Yeah, I'm fine.

Leon: Stay back!

[Leon uses the cannons on the different towers to shoot at the catapults and the approaching fanatics.]

Leon: Firing again! Come on!

[He destroys all six catapults.]

Ashley: You got it!

[With one last shot Leon destroys the main gate to the castle.]

Leon: All right. That went well. 

Ashley: A little warning next time!

[They go inside the castle.]

Ashley: Wow, look at this place. I mean, it's old but...

[Leon walks over to the table where the Merchant is standing.]

Merchant: So that's a request, done and dusted, eh? Good stuff, mate. Heheheh, I knew I could count on you. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! My back is killin' me. Years haven't been kind to us, I suppose. Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. Thank you! Easy work. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… Don't get yourself killed now, haha.

[After replenishing their supplies, Leon and Ashley walk further down the corridor. A midget dressed as a seventeenth-century French aristocrat comes out to them. He stands at the top of a tall and ornate staircase and looks at the heroes with some disdain. His skin arrives in a terrible state, which speaks of his significant age. The midget also speaks in a dignified manner, as befits his clothes, saying every word pretty clearly.]

Midget: A most warm welcome to my castle. Such a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance, Mr. Kennedy.

Leon: Who—the hell—are you?

Midget: Me? Oh please, call me Ramón. And allow me to get straight to the point. I would like you to hand the girl there, over to me...now.

Leon: Yeah, fat chance, Ramón. The girl's just fine. With me.

Ramón: Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kennedy. How noble. Nonetheless, you see, the girl must be ours. With that girl as the very source, your United States, and then… the entire world shall overflow with his grace. For that is the iron will of my master, the most holy Lord Saddler! So then, you will comply, yes?

Ashley: Never!

Leon: You heard the lady.

Ramón: How unfortunate.

[He snaps his fingers.]

Ramón: Do make sure our guest feels at home… now that he has chosen death.

[He leaves, at which point the central door at the bottom of the stairs opens, from which two fanatics emerge with shields and chains, as well as two more with scythes. The fanatics' shields are covered with crooked metal spikes.]

Leon: Just stay close.

[A fight ensues. Leon has to act thoughtfully and carefully or they will not get out of this situation alive.]

Ashley: Watch out! You OK?

Leon: Yeah, no sweat.

[He defeats all the fanatics and goes to the door.]

Leon: Ah, it's locked.

[He finds a place to give Ashley a boost so she can open the lock.]

Leon: Over here.

Ashley: ‘K.

Leon: Be careful.

Ashley: It's open.

Leon: Looks like we can continue on this way.

Ashley: Be careful.

[They descend into the dark dungeons of the castle and find a tortured corpse attached to a medieval torture machine.]

Leon: Poor bastard... That's no way to go.

[Caretaker's Note]
I was awoken in the middle of the night once again. It's those awful noises coming from the basement: the sounds of nails clawing at the stone walls and the writhing moan of curses.
That man harbors enough hate to ruin this world.
He once served the lord of the castle as the torturer, like his father and grandfather before him. It's one of the more unsightly legacies left by Salazar family.
Even among his family, he was "special" He enjoyed his work wholeheartedly and had a talent for it. He was gifted at tormenting others.
His ability soon attracted the master's interest. And when he took him to the dungeon—
No, I can't write anymore. I won't. I don't want to recall what happened down there.
My mind can't take it. It will break me…
I was ordered to attend to him: to feed him, dispose of the filth—all while listening to that wretched voice every night.
I can't take it anymore. I've had enough. I will not tolerate one more night in this castle.
I shall leave tomorrow. Go far away, where that voice cannot reach my ears.

[On the chest of another corpse, an inscription in Spanish, "None shall escape," is carved with a knife. Leon and Ashley hear some creepy noises.]

Ashley: Ah! What was that? Do they keep animals down here or something?

[In one of the cells, a man is imprisoned, wearing an iron mask and with huge, long claws attached to each arm. His hands are chained together and his eyes are sewn shut. He aggressively rushes forward, sensing Leon.]

Leon: It can't see me...

[However, he manages to escape his confinement. Ashley hides, and Leon escapes from the maniac through a tangled maze of dungeon corridors, eventually taking the fight to a rather vast room. He manages to inflict enough damage to reveal the plaga of Iron Wolverine.]

Leon: Gotcha!

[He fires his shotgun several times at the vulnerable point. The maniac, waving his iron claws left and right in agony, dies. Leon returns to a terrified Ashley.]

Ashley: Ah! Oh, it's you. What happened down there?

Leon: Nothing. You were right about the animals, though. You OK?

Ashley: I'm fine. Well, for now.

[They go up to the first floor of the castle. Ashley notices several large metal bas-reliefs attached to the wall, depicting various warriors in four scenes.]

Ashley: Wow... Look at all of this.

[Leon, meanwhile, is trying to open the door.]

Leon: Won't budge…

[He solves the puzzle by opening a room in which lies the body of a tall man made of plaster, impaled with a bloody bronze sword. Leon retrieves the sword.]

Ashley: What's that used for?

Leon: Well, it's just a replica. Only a couple uses for it.

[He goes to the metal bas-reliefs and swaps swords. The door opens.]

Ashley: This artwork... Doesn't it look like it's telling some kind of story?

[They continue to explore the castle.]

Ashley: Hang on, this is the same room as before, isn't it? Guess we just circled around.

[Leon decides to make a gutsy move - to jump to the other side of the second floor using a large metal chandelier attached to the wall. Thanks to his military training, he succeeds.]

Ashley: Leon, what're you doing!?

Leon: Don't even think about trying this yourself!

Ashley: Me? As if!

[On the other side, Leon finds another Merchant's store.]

Merchant: Gun rhymes with fun for a reason, stranger! Welcome! Well then. What can I do you for? Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Thank you! Give that the care it deserves, mate.

[After collecting useful items and opening the door, Leon returns to Ashley, who in the meantime has almost gone crazy with worry.]

Ashley: Leon! Are you kidding me!? Jumping across chandeliers? Seriously, who does that?

[Leon just chuckles.]

Leon: What're you, my mother?

[Ramón's voice comes from a megaphone attached to the wall.]

Ramón: Salutations, Mr. Kennedy. Are you ready to hand over the girl?

Leon: Not this guy again.

Ramón: I've taken the liberty of preparing some entertainment for you. Without further ado: the gallant knight protects the princess fair!

Ashley: Ugh!

[They find a book lying on the coffee table.]

[Parasites and their Ecology Vol. 2]
There are some parasites that have the ability to control their hosts.
This is basic knowledge among most biologists but not much is known as to how the parasites do it.
The following is a list of several such parasites.

Dicrocoelium
Once the larvae of this parasite migrate to the ant's esophagus, they alter the behavior of the ant. When the temperature drops in the evening. during peak grazing hours, the infected ant climbs to the top of a plant and clamps onto a leaf using its mandible with the intention of being eaten.

Galactosomum
The larvae of this parasite make their home inside the brain of a fish such as the yellowtail and the parrot bass. Once infected, the fish makes its way up to the water's surface, where it will swim until eaten by seabirds.

Leucochloridium 
This parasite's sporocysts develop in the snail's eye stalks, where they pulsate like worms. They alter the snail's behavior and force it to move to the top of a plant to make it more visible to birds. Once eaten by a bird, the parasite will complete its metamorphosis into an adult.

[Leon emerges into a room in each corner of which a copious fountain of black oil-like liquid is flowing. In the center of the room there is a handle to control the fountains, but the valve is missing somewhere.]

Leon: No good.

Ashley: Be careful.

[Fanatics lurked in the distance.]

Ashley: Leon, they're here!

Leon: Ah, the entertainment!

[A fierce battle ensues.]

Ashley: Leon! Watch out!

Leon: Out of the way! Come on! Hang on. Not bad, right? Shit!

[One of the fanatics steals Ashley.]

Ashley: Put me down!

[Leon stabs him in the throat.]

Ashley: You OK?

Leon: Yeah.

[The battle continues. Leon kills the fanatic with a pistol shot to the head.]

Leon: Sorry, must've slipped.

Ashley: Holy…

[Leon throws a flashbang grenade.]

Leon: This is gonna be bright!

[Having defeated the fanatics, Leon finds the valve.]

Leon: This should do the trick.

[He stops the fountains and goes up to the second floor where fanatics with shields are already waiting for him.]

Leon: Shit!

[After defeating the fanatics, Leon finds the valve for the second floor and also stops the fountains. Time to go higher.]

Ashley: All right, awesome!

Leon: We're not out of the woods yet.

[At the top, a new mystery awaits them with platforms rising out of the black slurry.]

Ashley: A hidden platform? 

Leon: A little over the top, don't you think?

[He finds a place where he can lift Ashley up to twist the remaining valves.]

Leon: Come on.

Ashley: ‘K.

Leon: You gonna be OK?

Ashley: Yeah. I-I got this!

[However, she quickly begins to have problems.]

Ashley: Leon!

Leon: I'll cover you! Don't stop!

Ashley: All right.

[Leon kills fanatics approaching Ashley with a sniper rifle.]

Ashley: All right! Now that one!

Leon: Be careful!

Ashley: Leon, watch out! 

[However, she herself is attacked.]

Ashley: Leon!

Leon: Hang on! I've got you!

Leon: Huh! C'mon! Ashley!

[He kills the last fanatic who attacked her.]

Leon: All right. 

Ashley: I did it!

Leon: OK, get back here!! Hurry up!

Ashley: OK!

Leon: You hurt?

Ashley: I'm good, thanks.

[They walk across this bridge to a small courtyard whose far door is closed, but Leon finds a way to throw Ashley over to the other side to open it.]

Leon: Over here.

[After this minor acrobatics, Ashley begins to cough.]

Leon: Hey, you sure you're good?

Ashley: Y-Yeah...

Leon: Looks like the right place.

[Ashley gets a headache. She touches her forehead and moans.]

Leon: You OK?

Ashley: I think so. Uh—

[She falls straight into Leon's arms, fainting, and a second later, with a change of face, pulls a knife from his holster.]

Ashley?: Instead of worrying about her… Foolish little lamb.

[She attacks Leon, but he intercepts the knife with his hand, leaving a streak of blood on its blade.]

Ashley?: Temperance, child!

[She points the bloody knife at her throat with a smile.]

Leon: Ashley! 

[She steps back and Leon follows her. Suddenly the metal gate slams shut between them. Ashley comes to her senses and throws the knife away in horror.]

Leon: Wait!

[Ashley runs away in tears.]

Chapter 8
[He decides to report the incident to headquarters.]

Leon: Roost, come in! Things went to shit. We took refuge inside a castle, but I've just been separated from Baby Eagle.

Hunnigan: Say---ding you. 

Leon: Roost? You're breaking up. Do you read me?

Hunnigan: --dor One! -- in! ---chopper-

[The connection is cut off.]

Leon: Damn it. So much for that.

[He goes in search of the runaway Ashley and finds another of the Merchant's shop.]

Merchant: Heheh. Having a rough day, stranger? Welcome! I've got something new for you, mate. Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. Perfect. You're a real professional. Good stuff, stranger! Came into some other bits and bobs too, mate. There's some things money can't buy. Don't worry, I offer repair services as well. Better to be overprepared, am I right? Give that the care it deserves, mate.

[After replenishing his supplies, Leon continues on his way and finds a kind of shrine, where a saint sitting in the lotus pose has a giant plaga instead of his head.]

Leon: This is messed up.

[He goes on and finds the red-robed Shaman preaching to his flock.]

Leon: Is he doing this? Sorry to interrupt! The hell is happening!?

[He kills the gathered fanatics and takes the lamp used to open the door. Going further, he finds a bedroom with the window wide open. As Leon gets a little closer to the window, Ada approaches him from behind, pointing her gun at him.]

Ada: You can stop right there, Leon. Wouldn't make me use this, would you?

[Leon smiles as he hears his old friend's voice.]

Leon: Well after six years, that is one hell of a greeting… Ada.

Ada: You don't seem surprised. Interesting...

[Leon takes a neat step back, turns around and takes the gun away from her, and then a dynamic fight ensues between them. Each fighter's combat experience is high enough that no one is going to concede to the other, but Leon still manages to put a knife to Ada's throat.]

Leon: Try using knives next time. Better for close encounters.

[Ada smiles slyly.]

Ada: Not a bad move. Very smooth.

Leon: So who are you working for this time?

Ada: Oh, Leon. You know I don't work and tell.

[Leon puts the knife away.]

Ada: Leave the girl. She's lost no matter what. You walk away now… and who knows? Maybe you'll live to meet me again. And then I might get you that "greeting" you were looking for.

Leon: You think I'm gonna give up that easy?

Ada: Right. How about we continue this discussion another time?

[Leon bends down to pick up his gun, but Ada has already escaped through the open window. Leon smiles, cursing his gullibility - Ada has once again laughed at him.]

Leon: Last person I thought I'd run into here...

[He solves the riddle of the placement of the stones in the secret door. The heavy wall pulls aside, revealing the passage.]

Leon: That should do it. All right, need to find Ashley.

[In the secret room, he finds a book lying on the table. The book is open on a certain page.]

[Iluminados 3:2]
Hear the signal echo through the mountains. Rocks become gravel and the castle walls crumble.
Behold the crimson shade of the night sky. A river of tainted blood befouls the sea.
Sacrifice your life and the blood of your enemy. Atone for your ancient sins.

Leon: Oh, great...

[He notices a huge plaga beetle attacking one of the fanatics, turning him into a berserker.]

Leon: Christ!

[He quickly kills the fanatic with a shot to the head. After wandering through the narrow corridors he finds another Merchant's store.]

Merchant: Gun rhymes with fun for a reason, stranger! Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. A deal well struck, heheh! Moldin' a weapon to suit your specific needs, oho! It's a thing of beauty, innit? Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. Dazzled, are you? Our craftsmanship demands no less.

[Soon Leon manages to reach the courtyard of the castle. There he hears Ramón's voice from the loudspeakers.]

Ramón: Oh, dear Mr. Kennedy. You appear to have lost your companion. 

Leon: She said meeting you once was enough. 

Ramón: How convenient, as I was growing tired of the moderate touch. Let us play this game of ours in true Salazar fashion.

[In front of Leon, the suspension bridge that blocked the passage to the other side of the castle is lowered.]

Leon: Oh, you were expecting me. OK, I think I see how this works.

[Leon walks through the narrow corridors shooting fanatics with his crossbow.]

Leon: Next?

[He climbs higher and higher until he reaches the roof. There, on the other side, he is greeted by a roaring giant troll, who seems even bigger than the last one. He's wearing a metal mask smeared with white paint, which makes him look a bit like a Uruk-hai, and the whole design is pleasantly reminiscent of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings.]

Leon: C'mon! Another one? You guys are really starting to become a giant pain in my ass.

[Since the giant is on the other side of the wall, Leon first has to get to him. Dodging the garbage thrown at him, he kills the fanatics that get in his way.]

Leon: Outta the way!

[Leon soon finds a cannon.]

Leon: Yes! A cannon! Hope it works.

[He brings it up and points it at the giant.]

Leon: Get ready. Adios, you son of a bitch.

[The giant, struck by a cannonball, falls from the wall. Leon breaks down the door with a shot so he doesn't have to worry about finding the keys.]

Leon: All right, open for traffic.

[He passes through the door and walks further up the wall However, the giant has no intention of dying. He climbs the wall and tries to grab the nimble Leon.]

Leon: Sorry. I've had my fill of you guys.

[He dodges the giant's grip. The giant, losing his balance, falls off the wall.]

Leon: (to himself) Ashley? Where are you?

[He enters the house and enters the guest room. Ashley sits on an antique bench and cries. When Leon slowly approaches her she backs away. She is frightened and on the verge of a nervous breakdown.]

Ashley: Stay back! I might hurt you again. I'm so scared. When that happened… I wasn't myself anymore. I was something else.

Leon: Ashley, that must have been terrifying. I-I know.

[She notices that the veins in Leon's hand, which he held out to her, are also full of blood like hers.]

Ashley: You too?

[Leon answers her confidently.]

Leon: It's OK to be afraid, you know. But you can't run. You got to keep moving forward. We will beat this. Together.

Ashley: I don't know if I can.

Leon: You can. Just give me a heads-up before you stab me next time, OK?

[Ashley smiles and is relieved.]

Ashley: Leon… Thanks.

Chapter 9
[Leon radioed Luis.]

Leon: Luis, where are you?

Luis: Sorry I, uh, I screwed up. Come to my rescue, Prince Charming.

Leon: I'll show you charming, pal!

Luis: C'mon. I'm in the ballroom past the courtyard. Don't be late to the dance!

[He disconnects.]

Leon: Can't believe that guy.

Ashley: He's in trouble. We can't just leave him, right?

[They walk out into the courtyard. Leon lowers the lever on one of the towers.]

Ashley: Hey, look! The flag's been lowered!

[They approach the cage behind which sit three embittered transformed wolves with toothy jaws. Leon sets some mines and opens the gate.]

Ashley: You let them out!

Leon: Easier this way!

[The wolves are blown up on mines. The heroes move on.]

Leon: Here, hold this down.

Ashley: Don't leave me! Hey, wait! Leon!

[They lower another flag.]

Ashley: You OK?

Leon: Yeah, no sweat.

[He finds the third switch.]

Leon: Ashley.

[He again asks the girl to hold the lever down for a while.]

Ashley: No prob. Be careful!

[Leon lowers the third flag. The door at the top of the grand staircase opens.]

Leon: Now we can finally get out of this maze.

[However, in addition to the main door, a gate also opens, from which several fanatics emerge. They go to Ashley.]

Ashley: Leon! They're here!

Leon: Ashley, run!

Ashley: Stay away! Stop! Leon!

[Leon runs toward her, killing fanatics in his path.]

Leon: Hold on! I'll take care of them! You hurt?

Ashley: I'm good, thanks.

[They ascend a high staircase and re-enter a lobby richly decorated with marble and mahogany.]

Leon: Ballroom must be this way.

[Soon they meet the Merchant.]

Merchant: I've got some new items in stock, heheh. Come, take a look! Welcome! Got something new for ya. That there's pretty big. Enough to get the job done, surely. Thank you! Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Give that the care it deserves, mate. Good luck to you, stranger. Knife needs care every once in a while. Could be the difference between life and death. Try that on for size. Come back anytime.

[Leon decides to take the elevator up to the Merchant's Shooting Range and practice.]

Merchant: Congratulations! I've prepared a new game for you. I think you'll like this one! Begin! Show 'em what you got! Reload! You're an artist, mate! Don't just shoot everything! Outstanding! That was awesome! That's your lot! You have a knack for this, friend! Now a shotgun—that can cover a lot of area with just one shell. Talk about bang for your buck. Begin! Triple kill! Superb shot! Oh, beautiful! Hah, yeah! Three at once! Reload! No! Not that one! Incredible! Triple kill! It's a bullet bonanza! Fire everything you've got! Very good! Triple kill! That'll do it! I can't believe it. Superb job! Begin! Show 'em what you got! That's the stuff! Brilliant! Reload! You missed. That's not like you. And that's the game!

Ashley: Nice one, Leon!

[Leon goes down to the first floor and he and Ashley continue on their way.]

Ashley: Look. There's a statue up there.

[They approach the statue of the three-headed monster but the heads are missing.]

Leon: There's a symbol on the wall. Statue of some snakes...

[They walk out into a long dining room with a table in the center.]

Leon: Huh, a dining hall.

Ashley: Eat? Here? No thanks...

[Nevertheless, they have to sit down at the table in order to solve the riddle.]

Leon: Ashley.

Ashley: Leon!

[They succeed and the cage with the snake's head goes down.]

Leon: Looks like we figured it out.

[They place the found head on the statue.]

Ashley: Hey, it fits.

[They ascend to the second floor in search of the next head and walk across a narrow bridge surrounded on both sides by a row of spears. Suddenly several masked fanatics appear on the other side of the bridge and lower the bridge.]

Ashley: Leon!

Leon: We're sandwiched all right!

[He has to fight his way through crowds of enemies in narrow rooms and corridors. At one point the fanatic even manages to steal Ashley again.]

Leon: I'm coming for ya!

Ashley: Stop! Hey! Up on the balcony!

[Leon gets hit hard on the head in an attempt to save Ashley.]

Leon: Fuck... I don't feel so...

[Finally he gets to the shaman in the red robe and rewards him for all the inconvenience he has caused with several shots from his shotgun.]

Leon: They keep coming!

Ashley: Leon! Help! Hey, wait! Leon!

[Leon saves his ward.]

Leon: All right, Ashley! Let's move!

Ashley: Uh, OK!

[He raises the bridge again and the heroes go to it.]

Leon: Ashley, are you all right?

Ashley: Yeah, thanks.

[They take the golden head of a goat, having removed it from the statue on the other side of the bridge, after which the heroes return to the statue on the first floor and put the head back in its place.]

Ashley: Looks like we're still missing a piece… Hey Leon, there's some armor. Bet you could use it like a bulletproof vest.

Leon: Little old fashioned for my taste.

Ashley: Too bad. I think you'd look pretty dashing.

[The last third head is well positioned in the center of a small circular room that no one is guarding.]

Leon: Ashley, stay up there!

Ashley: OK! Be careful!

[He jumps into the round room and takes his head. The gate, however, is closed and there is no way back.]

Ashley: Leon! The armor!

Leon: C'mon, you can't be serious!

[He is attacked by several las plagas knights in full armor. Despite their slowness, no weapon has any effect on them. Ashley decides to try to throw something at them.]

Leon: Hah!

[This "something" turns out to be a lamp.]

Ashley: Look! It stopped moving! I don't think they like the lantern fire!

[She decides to repeat her success.]

Ashley: Take this! Get away from Leon!

[Leon takes advantage of the sudden advantage and begins to shoot more actively at the knights.]

Leon: Go to hell, you rusty piece of shit!

[He manages to defeat all the knights.]

Ashley: Hey! Are you OK!?

Leon: Yeah! Nighty-night, knights.

Ashley: Leon!

[She jumps down to him and Leon catches her.]

Ashley: Thanks. You sure you're all right? You're not burned, are you?

Leon: Nah, thanks for your help. That really did the trick.

Ashley: Hehe.

[Leon takes the lion's head, then they approach two statues of centaur knights blocking the passage with their copies. Leon asks Ashley to take the hilt from the second centaur.]

Leon: Ashley.

Ashley: You don't think they're gonna move, do you?

[They press the handles at the same time and the centaurs raise their spears. Heroes return to the main hall and visit the Merchant to replenish supplies.]

Merchant: A job well done deserves payment in kind. Oh, what're ya buyin'? What's that? How have we procured these curiosities? Heheheh, you don't wanna know. Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Well, well, I can certainly do something with this. Good as new. Give that the care it deserves, mate. Hello, stranger. Nothing but the finest wares! Welcome! What can I interest you in? Next time buy somethin', ey?

[Leon and Ashley place the last head on the statue, opening a secret passage. Ashley notices fanatics beginning to climb the stairs.]

Ashley: Leon, the stairs!

[Leon pulls out his gun.]

Leon: Stay back!

[One of the fanatics switches a lever and Leon and the statue are caged together.]

Leon: Run! Now!

[Several fanatics end up in the cage with Leon. With swift and practiced movements, he kills them. Ashley, meanwhile, runs away from the fanatic running after her. Highly frightened, she hides in one of the rooms, locking the door behind her. After catching her breath, however, she makes a volitional decision.]

Ashley: I won't run. Wait for me, Leon.

[Picking up a lamp of some kind, she walks forward through the dark corridors. A fallen deer head, hanging like a hunting trophy, frightens her.]

Ashley: Don't scare me like that…

[She walks into a kind of library. On the opposite side of the room there is an antique clock built into the wall. Ashley walks up to it and looks around with interest—she doesn't seem to know what it is.]

Ashley: Is that a clock? It's broken.

[Ashley tries to turn the hands of the dial, but to no avail. She continues to explore the dark library with the lamp in her hands. In the labyrinth of cabinets she manages to find a cleverly hidden knob, by twisting it she pushes one of the cabinets behind which there is a passageway.]

Ashley: A hidden staircase? Must lead to a secret room or something.

[She climbs the stairs to the second floor and looks around the reading room. On the table she finds a bunch of keys.]

Ashley: Keys...

[When she descends into the library, she is horrified to find that the armor against the wall has begun to move. Remembering how hard it was for Leon to fight them, she shudders.]

Ashley: No way. It... It stopped?

[However, the armor continues to haunt Ashley only briefly stopping as if badly oiled. She runs up to the closed elevator door and frantically starts going through her keychain looking for the right one.]

Ashley: Which one is it!?

[She manages to find the right key and quickly runs into the elevator cabin, closing the grate behind her.The elevator begins to go up, but stops abruptly.]

Ashley: What now!?

[She manages to get out of the elevator car. As she walks forward, she notices a familiar face behind the iron bars.]

Ashley: Leon!

Leon: Ashley? Are you OK!?

Ashley: Hang on, I'll figure something out!

[Next to the closed iron grate, Ashley discovers a strange lock.]

Ashley: What's this slot for?

[A note from the librarian indicates that the key to this strange lock is in the Mausoleum hidden behind the broken clock.]

Ashley: Maybe...

[She looks around and finds a handwritten note indicating the time she needs to set the clock. She has to go down to the library again.]

Ashley: Yes!

[The time indicated in the note fits and the broken clock is pushed aside.]

Ashley: I know I saw another clock like this one...

[In a narrow corridor, she is attacked by a knight. He swings his sword ready to kill Ashley, but she stops him with her lamp - while her light is aimed at the knight they stop for a while.]

Ashley: It's all good, nice and slow…

[She frantically begins to twist the handle to open the door. The knight continues his pursuit.]

Ashley: Get lost! Don't look back. Don't look back. 

[She opens a second broken clock using the same time and goes further into the Mausoleum. At the far end of the Mausoleum there is an elevator. Ashley presses the button and waits for the elevator to arrive on her floor while a knight with a sword chases her!]

Ashley: Come on. Come on!

[She quickly runs into the open elevator doors and slams the bars behind her.]

Ashley: Oh, thank god. I am done with armor.

[However, the long hallway into which it exits is dotted with knight's armor!]

Ashley: Didn't I just say I was done!?

[To open the doors at the far end of the hall, she has to pull the chains hanging from the ceiling, which, in addition to opening the door, also awaken the armor.]

Ashley: This sucks!

[In the next corridor she will find a riddle related to light. In this corridor there is also a lot of armor.]

Ashley: The heck…

[She successfully solves the puzzle and takes the Salazar family crest. The armor is awakened!]

Leon: No, no... No, don't go out! Again!? I've had enough of this!

[Since she had to leave her lamp behind while solving the riddle, she has no means of dealing with the armor at all. She runs to the elevator in terror. Some of the armor blocks the passageway but they don't seem to move.]

Ashley: OK, be good knights and stay still...

[She crawls neatly underneath them and keeps running!]

Ashley: Almost there!

[She inserts the emblem into the lock opening the iron grate.]

Ashley: All right.

[She runs out to the second floor of the hall with the three-headed statue where Leon remains, trapped by an iron cage that has fallen from the ceiling.]

Ashley: Leon!

Leon: Ashley? Are you all right?

Leon: Yeah! Give me a sec, I'll get you out.

[She searches the corpse of a fanatic and a key falls out.]

Ashley: Hey! Try this!

[She throws the key she has found to Leon.]

Leon: Can you make it down? I can catch you.

[There is a great sense of confidence in Ashley's voice. Her little adventure has given her strength.]

Ashley: Yeah, I think so.

[Leon turns away to open his cage door, at which point Ashley grabs some monster in a red robe.]

Leon: Ashley!

[The beast is a bit like the Predator from the movie of the same name. It growls softly and walks away with a slow, heavy stride. Leon tries to shoot the monster in the back, but it only turns on him listlessly, then walks away.]

Leon: Shit!

Chapter 10
[We switch briefly to Ada Wong. She is standing on top of the castle, communicating with someone on the radio.]

???: So, what's become of the Amber?

Ada: Sorry. Nothing yet. But my little helper is creating quite the commotion. Everything will work out just fine.

???: As long as you can keep your dog under control.

Ada: He's a good boy. Predictable.

???: Fine. Keep your mutt. But don't come crying to me if you get bit.

[Through the bars and she sees a monster passing by with Ashley on his shoulder. She decides to contact Leon.]

Ada: Leon. Changed your mind yet?

Leon: Ada?

Ada: Assuming you haven't, I've got a tip for you. Seems like something big is about to go down in the throne room. Babysitting's tough, huh.

[She disconnects abruptly.]

Leon: Hey! Ada? Ada! ...Perfect. Same as ever...

[He decides to follow Ada's subtle hint and sets off for the throne room. On his way he encounters the same Knights from whom Ashley fled in terror, but Leon is quite capable of dealing with them.]

Leon: All right, time to get medieval on your asses. C'mon! Present for you.

[He throws a grenade at them.]

Leon: Yeah, that's right.

[He climbs higher and higher until he finds another Merchant's shop.]

Merchant: Nice work! I've got something new for you, mate. What's that? How have we procured these curiosities? Heheheh, you don't wanna know, mate. Got something new for ya. Heheheheh, thank you. There you are, as you wished. A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… Ah... I'll buy it at a high price. Knife needs care every once in a while. Could be the difference between life and death. You'll be shooting off some nasty fireworks in quick succession with that! Try that on for size. See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away.

[He goes on and walks down a long corridor with something lurking on the ceiling. Leon pulls out his gun and shoots it into the darkness, killing some bug-like creature. It's very likely that if the creature had gone unnoticed it would have jumped on Leon...]

Leon: Fucking monsters…

[Soon he is attacked by a pack of similar creatures. They can fly and can attack anywhere. Leon hides from them in a room where he finds several scattered pieces of paper.]

[Chronicles of Pursuit 1]
July, two years since my awakening—
Master Ramón has bestowed upon me a truly righteous undertaking to improve upon the flaws of our human form to seek perfection as observed in our arthropodal siblings.
To this cause I shall willingly devote my life.
January, four years since my awakening—
My efforts to transfuse the black liquid into the body are at the precipice of success.
The womb is the key.
A pure soul proves to be a highly malleable and adaptive subject.
January, six years since my awakening—
I have named these sacred larvae, carried in the wombs of the chosen, U-II after my own. They shall carry the prestige of my family name as if I had spawned them of my own flesh.
The U-II are now close to the size of adult humans, and they continue to feed and multiply. I have successfully created a new species!
Master Ramón has recognized my efforts and blessed me with his praise. He has taken to U-II, calling them Novistador, meaning "The Unseen."
I've been told that his holiness, Lord Saddler himself, has also expressed pleasure with my work.
What an extraordinary honor this is! I can hardly see the tip of my quill through the tears of joy.
His humble servant, Isidro Uriarte Talavera

[Soon, when Leon emerges into a large circular room with several floors, he is attacked by several of these Novistador.]

Lion: They keep coming! Wow Ramón, you are really slacking on your pest control.

[Leon economically kills the flying creatures with his gun. He climbs to the top of the large room and switches the lever that opens the iron gate below.]

Leon: Throne room... This the way?

[He hears laughter coming from the loudspeaker.]

Ramón: Oh, Mr. Kennedy. Not much of a knight, are you? Your princess is a spirited individual. I must say, she gave us a considerable amount of trouble!

[Leon walks down the corridor and opens the massive wooden door behind which two fanatics in chains are waiting for him, one of whom he has already encountered in the catacombs.]

Leon: Great, there's two of them.

[He gets to the clawed monsters and uses tactics. He even manages to sneak up on one of them and stab it in the back.]

Leon: Gotcha!

[The fight is long and hard, but Leon still manages to win. He goes up to the door to the throne room and after installing the necessary parts of the statue to open the door, he hears Ashley screaming.]

Ashley: Nooo! No!

Leon: Ashley!

[Ashley's face has the symbol of the local religion painted on it in blood. Two fanatics drag her up the stairs.]

Ashley: Leon! Stop! No! Don't come any closer!

Leon: Are you hurt?

Ashley: Watch out!

[A big man with a monstrous insect-like face jumps down on Leon from above. He pins Leon to the floor. Ramón, meanwhile, sits on the throne.]

Ramón: Please. Do continue.

[The fanatics continue the ritual. One of the fanatics brings a large bowl.]

Ashley: No! No! Please! Let me go!

Ramón: Do not resist, my dear. It serves only to make your suffering all the worse.

[Ashley begs for mercy, but the fanatics don't pay any attention to it, open her mouth and pour in some liquid from a bowl. The liquid resembles blood, but I have trouble understanding what it is.]

Leon: You sick—

[After drinking the liquid, Ashley begins to cough. Her hands are covered with black spots spreading all over her body. Leon tries to break free from the beastly grip of the monster.]

Ramón: (In Spanish) This is farewell, Mr. Kennedy.

[The monster throws Leon into a hole that seems bottomless.]

Ashley: Leon!

[After flying a few meters, Leon manages to grab hold of a dangling chain and stop his fall. He slides down the chain and almost falls into some disgusting sludge. After swinging on the chain, he jumps off onto the slightly flooded floor.]

Leon: Hang in there, Ashley. I'm coming for you.

[He begins to explore the ancient catacombs in which he finds a corpse.]

Leon: Gave up the ghost, huh?

[He walks down a narrow passageway where he has to lift a corpse to pass on.]

Leon: Talk about sticking the landing.

[He continues his perilous journey through the dark cave, knee-deep in water. From time to time dangerous slippery creatures jump out of the water and quickly retreat into the murky water.]

Leon: The hell—!?

[He fights them off and lights his way with a flashlight, but he finds a way to get on solid ground, or rather, on the damp stone of the castle dungeon.]

[Prisoner's Note]
Another one dead.
How long has it been since I was thrown down here?
The meager scraps of food provided in the beginning are gone and they don't give us more.
The pains of hunger and thirst are unbearable. Most have resorted to drinking the black water.
The first to turn was Herminio.
He was so weak that he couldn't even walk, but then suddenly became mad.
By the time his rampage ended, two were dead. I think we shouldn't drink that dark liquid.
Dear Abelardo has also passed, though he fought until the very end.
The only thing I can do now is honor the bodies and pray that their souls find peace.
Oh Lord, why do you test us so?

[Leon breaks the partially collapsed stonework with his foot and climbs the stairs and finds himself in the more modern upper part of the underground dungeon.]

Leon: Give me a break.

[Not particularly surprised, he finds another Merchant's store.]

Merchant: Gun rhymes with fun for a reason, stranger! A deal well struck, heheh! Come back anytime. Welcome! Oho! You'll cut through the crowd with that right there. Knife needs care every once in a while. Could be the difference between life and death. Dazzled, are you? Our craftsmanship demands no less.

[After replenishing his supplies, Leon exits through a door and enters a long corridor fortified with metal beams and sheet metal. As he walks to the far end, which is covered by an iron grate, he hears the muffled sound of a siren and a stream of icy air rushes at him from somewhere in the ceiling under high pressure.]

Leon: Fuck! Not good!

[Leon enters the room to the right of the iron grille and enters a kind of laboratory. It is rather unkempt, with numerous tables on which are arranged various metal containers and test tubes. It all looks rusty and shabby.]

[Chronicles of Pursuit 3]
May, nine years since my awakening—
Upon the release of this valve, black liquid shall, enter my veins and circulate throughout my entire body
I expect this will be the most painful experience of my life.
I await the trial with great anticipation. It is an honor to suffer through the holy labor of rebirth.
The next time I awaken, it will be as a true servant of Master Ramón.
I, Isidro Uriarte Talavera, make this vow.
I will surpass the limitations of man and become a true servant of God.
I will find the heretics and serve as their executioner. Their Verdugo.

[At the far end of the lab, Leon finds a pale corpse on which experiments have clearly been conducted. The corpse is attached to a turntable.]

Leon: These people are not right.

[He tries to call the elevator, but it does not respond to the button. There is a note next to the button that does not work.]

Leon: Something wrong with the power?

[He walks down the corridor in search of a generator to start it up. The camera view switches to a view from the eyes of some monster that is prowling the corridors looking for a new victim. When Leon restores power to the room with the generator he is attacked by a monster remotely resembling a xenomorph.]

Leon: You're kidding me… You! You're Ramón's lapdog!

[He presses a button on the wall and a powerful jet of icy air freezes the monster.]

Leon: Frozen's a good look for you.

[He approaches the monster and shoots it in the head with a shotgun. Unfortunately this does not kill the monster and the fight continues.]

Leon: Outta the way! Eat this! C'mon!

[After a brief struggle, Leon realizes that killing the monster is not that easy task and decides to retreat.]

Leon: Looks like it's gonna take more than that.

[He leaves the room with the generator by choosing a moment and turning the emergency door opening valve. The elevator at this moment receives power and begins to descend to his floor.]

Leon: What's your move?

[The monster continues to pursue him.]

Leon: I think you need to chill out!

[He uses the ice air system again to stun the monster. Leon then approaches the monster and unloads a clip of his automatic rifle into it.]

Leon: How's that? Hits different, huh!

[The monster decides to change tactics.]

Leon: So we're playing hide-and-seek, is that it?

[The monster attacks Leon from under the lattice floor, trying to pierce him with its sharp tail. After a brief struggle, the elevator finally arrives on the floor.]

Leon: You son of a bitch!

[He finally manages to defeat the monster!]

Leon: Finally, some peace and quiet. My condolences to your master.

[He enters the elevator and begins to go up. At that moment he has another seizure. His veins fill with black blood, his head splits open and he falls to the floor unconscious. Whether he is unconscious or not, he hears Lord Saddler's voice.]

Saddler: Pitiful little lamb. Your suffering can end. Just as it has for our newest daughter. Who has joined us in communion. And now, she is of our flesh.... of our blood. My faithful disciple will show her the path. Go now! Deliver to these vagrant children their salvation.

Leon?: As you wish.

[The man crouching in front of Saddler raises his knife and we see in the reflection not Leon's face but that of a red beret-wearing military man. Leon awakens on the floor of the elevator and rises to his feet. The elevator reaches the top floor. When the doors open and he is greeted by Luis holding a small metal box sealed with yellow duct tape. In the box tinkles something made of glass.]

Luis: I'll make it cheap for you.

Chapter 11
[The metal box contains the serum that blocks the infection. Luis gives Leon an injection.]

Luis: Feeling better?

Leon: Yeah. Seems like it worked.

[Luis silently plays with his Zippo lighter.]

Leon: Bad news?

Luis: All we've done is buy you some time. The suppressant's effects will wear off all too soon.

[Leon takes another syringe from the box.]

Luis: You ready to go?

Leon: Don't worry about me. Ashley is the priority.

Luis: In that case, we know what we have to do. Then come, Sancho Panza!

[He picks up the iron pipe standing in the corner and holds it in his hands as if he were holding a spear.]

Luis: Let us rescue the Princess Dulcinea!

[Leon takes the iron pipe away from him.]

Leon: You're gonna hurt yourself!

Luis: Hey! That was my lance! OK, we hurry! I get it!

Leon: Why help me, though? What's in it for you?

Luis: No need to be suspicious! I said I'd help you, didn't I?

[Now Leon has to go to the surface. He and Luis find themselves in an old abandoned mine. After searching through the debris and wooden boxes lying around he finds the diary.]

[Foreman's Log]
Date: October 11
Today was the worst day of my life. It's my daughter's 5th birthday, but here I am stuck on a mangey boat heading out to some backcountry dump.
If it weren't for the pay, no one would be willing to work out in the middle of nowhere.

Date: October 19
Those in the castle are always reminding us to take care during the excavation, but a few workers collapsed after inhaling some dust. There's something going on here that they're not telling us. There are too many secrets.
I've started coughing too. I should sleep.

Date: October 26
Something's really wrong with me. I threw up blood three more times today, and I'm so weak I can barely move.
Shit, I never should have come here. I came for the money, but instead I am the one paying the price. I'm a terrible father.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart. You deserve better.

Date: October
Since morning, head don't work. Why?
More blood threw up.
Many insects crawling.
I HEAR A VOICE.

Date:
A fine day to work.
Digging brings me so much joy.
I am full of happiness. 
I offer it all to you.
Everything for you, Lord Saddler.

[Soon Leon finds another Merchant's store.]

Merchant: I have some new goods that might interest you. Welcome! I've got something new for you, mate. You'll get some bang for your buck, I guarantee it. I don't always have this in stock, stranger. 

[Leon takes the elevator to the shooting range to practice his skills.]

Merchant: There you are! We got a new game for you, stranger. You're gonna take 'er for a spin, right? Targets don't just stick around forever, ey? Don't let the small fry distract you from the big fish! Begin! 

Luis: That was dirty. 

Merchant: Oh, beautiful! That's the stuff! Reload! You're an artist, mate! Heheheh! Let the bonus time begin! Bonus targets! Hard to turn that down! Brilliant! C'mon! And that's the game! Not every day I see a performance like that. You're something else, you are! Begin! Triple kill! That's it! You're an artist, mate! 

Luis: Makin' it look easy! 

Merchant: Sorry mate, that's a penalty. Reload! 

Luis: Oh, a double. Nice. 

Merchant: Double kill! That's your lot! Some of the targets are, well, particularly sturdy. One shot won't be enough for those, I'd wager! Begin!

Luis: Don't go easy just because it's a game.

Merchant: Oh, beautiful!

Luis: A triple!? Look at this guy!

Merchant: Reload! You're an artist, mate! Double kill! That's it! Incredible! Very good! Double kill! And that's the game!

Luis: Good work. Good shootin', cowboy. I had fun just watching you work.

[Leon takes the elevator downstairs and continues to look for a way up.]

Leon: Little hard to put my faith in someone who used to work for Umbrella.

Luis: So you heard, huh? Umbrella's done for. You don't need to worry about them anymore.

Leon: You didn't answer my question. What are you after?

Luis: I just wanna feel good about myself. Make amends. Or something like that.

[They walk along the dilapidated railroad tracks on which the trolleys were lowered, climbing higher and higher. Soon they come to a dead end and turn right and enter the wide part of the cave where the work area is located. The bridge leading to the other side is raised. In the distance they see a ganado with a torch.]

Luis: Looks like we've got company. What do you wanna do?

[Leon decides to engage in open combat.]

Luis: ¡Cuidado! (Watch out!) The ones with chainsaws are no joke!

Leon: Believe me, I know!

[They have to fight a whole crowd of ganados.]

Luis: Not bad, right?

Leon: Huh! Outta the way! That was not easy.

[Defeating them all he finds a way to lower the bridge but they are attacked again. Luis defends Leon by shooting him several times in the head of the ganado and finishing him off with a spinning blow.]

Luis: Time to shine!

Leon: Aren't you full of surprises?

[They cross the lowered bridge continuing to fight.]

Luis: Leave it to me!

[He kills a few ganados by rushing forward.]

Leon: Not bad.

[Leon fights several opponents.]

Luis: You got this!

Leon: Sure thing!

[After defeating all enemies, he finds a bundle of dynamite.]

Leon: I bet I could use this.

Luis: Dynamite, huh? Nice find, my friend.

Leon: Yeah. Should make quick work of that dead end.

[They return to the rock-strewn passageway and Leon places dynamite sticks on a large boulder.]

Luis: ¡Dios mío! Give me a heads-up next time!

Leon: You handle yourself pretty well… You sure you're just a researcher?

Luis: I'm just an average guy who happens to be quite the ladies' man. 

[The corridor ends with a passageway closed by a metal grille. The passageway leads to a large round room. Leon, unable to find any other way to open the grille, kicks it open.]

Luis: After you, I insist.

Leon: Such a gentleman.

[He approaches the resulting passageway and at that moment a large troll, reminiscent of Lord of the Rings again, looks out at him from the other side. He grabs Leon by the leg.]

Luis: Hey!

[He grabs Leon by the arm, trying to wrestle him out of the troll's monstrous grip, but the troll has no problem dragging them both into the round room. Luis lands on the metal floor while Leon remains in the troll's grasp. Quickly pulling out his gun Luis forces the troll to let Leon go with a few shots.]

Luis: Now you owe me!

Leon: Luis! Heads up!

[A second troll jumps on Luis, trying to crush him with his mighty foot, but Luis dodges.]

Leon: Now we're even.

Luis: Is it always like this with you?

[The unequal battle in the small arena begins! In addition to his massive height and tremendous strength, the second troll is also armored.]

Luis: Two of them. One for each of us! Leave this one to me!

[Leon uses his most powerful weapon to knock at least one of the giants to the ground, and then, climbing on its back, attacks the parasite that shows up with his knife. The giant troll stands up, but after a few more shots it sways to the ground.]

Leon: This other one's not gonna be easy.

Luis: Ugh! It moved! Sorry, keep our friend busy for me!

Leon: Where do you think you're going?

[He runs away, but soon returns with dynamite in his hands.]

Luis: Leon! Over here!

[Leon tries to approach Luis to catch the dynamite, but the troll makes an effort to prevent him from doing so.]

Luis: What are you doing!? Hurry up!

[Leon decides to lure the troll closer to the ladder where Luis is standing and hides behind it. Luis jumps on the troll and sticks unlit dynamite in his armor.]

Luis: Delivery!

[He jumps off, leaving Leon to finish the job.]

Leon: Heh! Got a little present, just for you!

Luis: Leon, shoot it!

[Leon fires several shots of dynamite and the troll falls to the iron grate in the center of the circular room, losing consciousness.]

Luis: Beautiful! Just as planned! All right, let's finish this guy off!

[Leon pulls a handle on a nearby panel and the hatch in the center of the circular room opens. The troll falls into the boiling lava and, as it burns, reaches for Leon, completing the Lord of the Rings reference.]

Luis: Perfect timing! ¡Oye! I think we can get through here! 

[Leon goes to the iron wall and helps Luis get to the other side through a small hole.]

Leon: Come on.

[Luis explores his surroundings for a while.]

Leon: How's it look?

Luis: There. It's open.

[He opens the door to Leon's right.]

Luis: Well, that was a pain.

Leon: They're keeping those things cooped up down here, too?

Luis: The underground here is sacred to them. See, this is where they discovered las plagas. Preserved inside ancient deposits of amber.

Leon: Of course they did.

[Leon and Luis continue their ascent to the surface. They find an entire wagon standing on the rails.]

Luis: You're not suggesting we ride this thing? Do you see any other way?

[He gets on the wagon.]

Luis: Give us a push, Sancho!

Leon: Who're you calling "Sancho"?

Luis: There, it's moving. This should speed things up a bit.

Leon: I can't believe I'm doing this.

Luis: Hey, we're in a hurry, right? Oh, by the way…

Leon: What now?

Luis: Hope you like thrill rides.

[They start moving abruptly. Leon, who was pushing the wagon from behind, quickly jumps in.]

Luis: We're going off the rails! Lean! ¡Mierda! Do something about those boards! ¡Oye! Switch tracks! If we don't, we're gonna crash! We're going off the rails! Give me a hand! 

[Comically, they are somehow overtaken by ganados on other wagons on different rails. They shoot at Leon using crossbows with flaming arrows.]

Luis: It's them! Watch out! Up ahead! Shoot the boards!

[They drive into a narrow tunnel and lose sight of their pursuers for a while.]

Luis: Finally some peace and quiet.

[However, at this point, the wagon accelerates and Leon has to maneuver so as not to fall off the rails.]

Luis: Left turn! We're curving to the right!

[After another firefight, the wagon finally creaks to the end station.]

Leon: This it?

Luis: Afraid not. Things are just getting started.

[They find themselves in a dilapidated mining town where they must once again face off against the ganado. Some of them hold lit dynamite in their hands.]

Leon: Shit!

[Climbing the wooden stairs they find another wagon.]

Luis: All right, let's go.

Leon: Not this again…

[They start riding the rails again at insane speeds.]

Luis: Hey! The cart's tipping over!

Leon: We've got trouble.

[They are being attacked again from different directions.]

Luis: Haha! This is kind of fun! We're going off the rails! Give me a hand! Left turn! Shit! This thing's gonna flip! 

[Now the extra rails that are next to those on which the heroes are riding become larger and they are attacked by more ganados. Even a madman with a chainsaw appears!]

Luis: Not looking so good. I hope the cart holds up… This thing's in bad shape. Take better care of it, OK?

Leon: End of the line, asshole!

[He kills the madman with a chainsaw.]

Luis: We're going off the rails! Give me a hand! Hey! The cart's tipping over! Look! You can see where they dug up the bugs! Ahead!

[The flights in the distance end with a sharp cliff.]

Leon: You're kidding… Get the brake!

[Luis tries to brake, but the brake lever breaks.]

Leon: What!? Are you serious!? Jump!

[They abruptly jump out of the wagon, landing on solid ground. Leon, with his military training, lands on his feet, and Luis hangs on the edge of the bridge.]

Luis: ¡Oye!

Leon: Luis!

Luis: Can I get a hand? Give us a "3, 2, 1" next time, eh Sancho.

[Leon helps him climb the bridge.]

Leon: Whatever.

Luis: Oh, man... Hm, but actually this works. Oye. Let's get on that lift.

[However, the wooden bridge leading to the elevator breaks down...]

Luis: No way. Give me a break.

Leon: We can make it if we circle around. Come on.

Luis: Pain in my ass…

[They jump down below and walk through small caves. Leon notices something strange on the ground and takes out his crossbow and shoots at it. It turns out to be a huge insect.]

Luis: Ah! I knew it! Stay sharp! These guys have camouflage!

[They are attacked by several more of the exact same flying creatures.]

Luis: You got this!

Leon: One down.

Luis: It's all you!

[They defeat the group of insects that attacked them.]

Luis: I hate insects! Take care of them for me, would ya?

Leon: How about you open fire instead of your mouth!

Luis: Hey, I'm the brains. You're the brawn.

[In the depths of the caves Leon manages to find another Merchant's store and decides to restock.]

Merchant: Ah, I see you took care of a request. Well done. Thank you! Pleasant travels. A deal well struck, heheh! Good luck to you, stranger. That's good work if I do say so myself.

[They finally get to the elevator and go up.]

Luis: Whew. I'm beat. Makes you appreciate tech like this.

Leon: I don't get you. Why risk your life like this? You don't know us.

Luis: I told you. It makes me feel better.

Leon: Be straight with me for once.

Luis: Los Iluminados... I was working for them.

Leon: See? There you go.

Luis: Helping the two of you.doesn't make up for it. I know that. But still...I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

Leon: In that case, you better get serious.

Luis: Harsh words for a squire.

[The elevator stops and opens the doors.]

Luis: We're out of that hellhole! The fresh air is calling our names! Because if we made it all this way, you know it means we're almost—

[He stops abruptly at half a word.]

Leon: Almost what?

[Luis coughs up blood and falls to the floor with a knife in his back.]

Leon: Luis!

[He runs up to him, but there is nothing he can do. Next to Luis' body stands his murderer, the soldier in the red beret we saw earlier.]

Military in Red Beret: Long time no see, rookie.

Leon: Major Krauser? What the hell? Why?

Krauser: Recovering stolen goods.

[He takes a flask of red liquid from Luis' pocket.]

Krauser: And killing a few rats along the way. Easy work.

Leon: Ashley... It was you.

[He reaches for his gun, but Krauser runs up to him much faster with his knife.]

Krauser: You catch on quick. Didn't I teach you? Knives are faster.

[They fight dashingly with knives for a while. Their movements are so refined and fast that it's hard to keep track of them.]

Krauser: Not bad.

[They fight again, but this time Krauser wins and he pushes Leon down.]

Krauser: We are just getting started, rookie.

[An aggressive hand-to-hand fight ensues!]

Leon: Are you being controlled by that cult!?

Krauser: This has nothing to do with them. I'm a free man who made a choice.

Leon: Major! You're not thinking straight!

Krauser: Oh, my mind's clearer than it's ever been. Now focus and show me what you've got.

Leon: A soldier like you? Why would you work for these freaks?

Krauser: Why? Have you forgotten what happened two years ago?

Leon: Operation Javier?

Krauser: Haven't you learned anything these last two years? They killed us all. Without honor. Without mercy. Only devastating power! What's wrong with wanting the same for myself?

Leon: Krauser! I can understand. What happened was...unforgivable. But that doesn't give you the right to hurt innocent people!

Krauser: You're still a kid holding on to fantasies of what's right and wrong. Too slow! What's wrong? Not looking too steady.

[He wins again and knocks Leon to the floor, then comes at him with a knife to finish him off, but that's when Luis shoots in his knife! Somehow he survives the stab to the spine.]

Krauser: Enough play, rookie. You haven't changed a damn bit. What a disappointment.

[He tucks his knife into the scabbard on his shoulder and walks away. Luis slumps exhausted to the floor.]

Luis: Not looking good, eh, my friend? And such a loss to the ladies of the world.

Leon: Don't talk.

Luis: Take this. The key to my laboratory. Go there… and remove those damn… parasites… Help… Ashley…

[He tries to smoke but the lighter falls out of his hands. Leon picks up the lighter and lights Luis' cigarette.]

Luis: You know, I led a pretty shitty life. But now, eh… ...what do you think, Leon? People can change, right?

[The cigarette falls out of his mouth. He dies. Leon puts the lighter in his weakened palm.]

Chapter 12
[Leon says goodbye to his fallen comrade.]

Leon: You were a fine knight, Don Quixote.

[He returns to his quest.]

Leon: You won't get away with this, Krauser.

[He continues his journey to the surface and enters the elevator. There he receives a call from Ada on his transmitter. The connection is not good - the picture keeps breaking up and the sound is lost periodically.]

Ada: Leon. There's only time to say this once, so listen up. They took your friend to the top of the clock tower. If you hurry, you might get there before she turns into one of them.

Leon: Ah, so you aren't heartless after all. I guess I should be...thankful?

Ada: Yeah, you should.

[He gets on a cable car that goes to a huge clock tower in the distance.]

Leon: There's the clock tower. Hang in there, Ashley.

[He enters the first floor of the tower, which is a warehouse of various wooden structures, a ladder in the distance, and a huge old mechanical doll that strongly resembles Ramón Salazar's original design. Ramón himself walks out to Leon from the second floor clapping his hands waltzily.]

Ramón: You are nothing if not unyielding, Mr. Kennedy. However, I am afraid it ends here. Expel this intruder!

[He pits his fanatics against Leon. Now it is up to Leon to climb to the top, avoiding crowds of enemies and a variety of cunning traps.]

Leon: You really know how to make someone feel welcome.

[After walking a few floors full of dangers, he finds a freight elevator.]

Leon: A lift. How thoughtful.

[However, his troubles are just beginning - a lot of fanatics standing on the stairs keep attacking Leon and trying to climb the elevator plateau. As long as the elevator itself moves slowly enough Leon turns into an excellent target.]

Leon: You don't give up, do you?

[Suddenly the elevator begins to stop.]

Leon: What!? The lift!

[He shoots at the fanatic holding the lever.]

Leon: Sorry! Lift's taken! All right. Shit, my body armor!

[When the elevator reaches the top, he steps into a metal platform where he hears the chime of the clock. At last he is on the surface! Looking around through the binoculars, he sees Ramon and several of his subordinate fanatics dragging Ashley away.]

Leon: Ashley! That son of a bitch.

[He goes after Ramón. On his way to a building down the mountain he finds the Merchant's store. There he repairs his armor vest and the knife he broke in the battle.]

Merchant: You have the stench of battle on you, mate. Heheh. Welcome! Well then. What can I do you for? Stocking up while you can? Wise choice. A deal well struck, heheh! Good as new. Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. There you are, as you wished. Will that be all, then? Don't get yourself killed now, haha. Nothing but the finest wares!

[After restocking, Leon walks through a massive door into the building where, at this very time, Ramón hands Ashley over to Krauser.]

Ramón: And so, I have delivered the girl to you, as promised! Do tell our lord to not forget the loyalty of his servant, Ramón.

[Krauser grabs the girl without a word and puts her on his shoulder, then quickly leaves the room. At that moment Leon enters.]

Leon: Ashley!

Ashley: Leon!

[Krauser leaves.]

Ramón: Such a fool, Mr. Kennedy. To have been bestowed with Lord Saddler's grace, and yet fail to—

Leon: You talk too much.

[He shoots Ramón.]

Ramón: You vulgar, utterly uncivilized—

[Leon shoots him in the head. Ramón says the last words as he flies off the bridge he was standing on.]

Ramón: mongrel…

[Nevertheless, this does not, as it turns out, kill him. His laughter reverberates throughout the great room, and the black sludge with which the columns are smeared begins to boil.]

Ramón: Allow me to show you… the power I have been granted by my master. The power of God! The stage is set for the final act!

[He transforms into a kind of meat flower in which he himself is something of a stamen. Ramón spits a stream of black slurry at Leon, which he dodges. The battle begins!]

Ramón: You're nothing but an extra in my script, Mr. Kennedy. So don't get too carried away. Your biggest scene is over.

Leon: Leave me out of your crappy script.

Ramón: Well then, why don't you show me what a first-class script is like...through your own actions! And now we transition to irregular metre! Dance or die, as you desire! Either way suits you wonderfully. Ahaha. ¡Qué bonito, qué bonito! You dance the bolero superbly! Is something amiss? The show has only just begun! Oh dear, I've just realized I haven't set the cast of this play. For you...oh yes. You shall play the role. of my "Pulgarcito." Fitting, don't you think?

[Unlike his previous static version, Ramón in the remake moves around the room quite vigorously, but Leon still manages to inflict enough damage to make Ramón sit on the railing.]

Ramón: Ugh. Y-You worm!

[Leon stabs his knife into the huge yellow eye on Ramón's head, which is located where the ear is supposed to be.]

Ramón: You worthless piece of filth! Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!

Leon: Watch your language, my lord. What would others think of you?

Ramón: This means death! A slow, miserable death! Die! Die! Die! You tiny, ugly, sickly half-wit! You should never have been born, you demon child!

Leon: I will send you back to the hell you came from!

Ramón: Bastard! Troublesome bastard! Does that hurt? Are you in pain? Distressed? Hahahaha! Such suffering! It's revolting! First your nose. Your ears. Then your fingernails. Your lips. I'll save your eyes for last! I shall drink the blood out of every last cavity of your body. Every drop! Oh, I cannot wait!

[Leon stabs him in the eye one more time.]

Ramón: I will kill you! I'll kill you! I'LL KILL YOU! Wh-Why are you looking at me like that!? At me, THE Ramón Salazar! You, too, is that it!? It is, isn't it? I know it is! Damn you! Damn you, damn you, damn you! How DARE you look at me like that!? Ahhh! Damn it! I shall silence you! Aaaah! ¡Joder! This bastard!? I won't allow it! 

[Leon stabs Ramón in the eye for the third time.]

Ramón: You wooorrrm! The pain... THE PAIN! Master, grant me your power!

Leon: I'm gonna shut that mouth of yours for you.

[He shoots the weakened Ramón and he falls to the floor.]

Ramón: Please help me… Lord Saddler…

[Ramón dies. The vibration of the giant's fallen body causes the raised suspension bridge to collapse with a rumble.]

Leon: Ashley... No time to lose.

[He leaves the building, gets in the elevator, and goes downstairs. As the elevator descends, he sees through the bars as Krauser takes Ashley away on a boat.]

Leon: Krauser… Where do you think you're taking her?

[Once downstairs, Leon walks through the stone corridors.]

[Housekeeper's Memo 1]
I have failed you, my lord.
I was unable to fulfill your final commandment and keep the boy from the path of wickedness.
I caught a glimpse of Master Ramón's evil temperament during his younger years.
When he discovered a servant mocked him by uttering "Pulgarcito" behind his back, he summoned her to his private chambers. After forcing her to kneel before him, Ramón doused her face with a vial of vitriol he pulled out of his pocket!!
The young master watched with glee when the servant writhed in agony as the skin melted from her face. His twisted grin still haunts my... dreams to this very day.
As time passed, Ramón's treachery only deepened, and that infernal cult soon learned they could prey upon his vulnerable heart. Curse the fiends!
They've manipulated Master Ramón and turned him into their puppet.
Worst of all, they've managed to use him to unleash las plagas that the Salazar family has fought so long and hard to keep sealed away!
Lord Diego,
Rest assured, I intend to watch over Master Ramón until the very end, whatever fate may befall us.
As a faithful servant of the Salazar family since birth, it is my duty and my penance to you!

[He finds a dock where a boat is moored.]

Leon: Perfect. Won't have to swim after all.

[He's looking for the ignition key but can't find it.]

Leon: Ah, damn it.

[Ada walks up to him unnoticed.]

Ada: Looking for something?

[She's holding the key to the boat.]

Chapter 13
[The boat cuts through the waves at high speed. Ada sits behind the wheel, and Leon takes a moment to take a break.]

Ada: You look like you've got something to say.

Leon: I've something to ask you… but I don't think I'll get a straight answer. Raccoon City. You know, after the incident. The world changed. You try to save one person; a hundred others die. I guess I changed too.

Ada: You? Leon S. Kennedy? You haven't changed. You just think you have.

Leon: So here's my question… Have you changed, Ada? Or are you just trying to use me again?

Ada: What do you think? We're here.

[She uses her pistol with a cat hook and shoots at the nearest building.]

Ada: Don't think too hard, handsome. See you later.

[Pressing on the return mechanism, she flies out of the boat.]

Leon: Story of my life.

[He gets behind the wheel and sails up to the island. After looking around a bit, he realizes that this is what appears to be one huge military base. Or he uses binoculars to study it and pretty quickly finds Krauser dragging Ashley on his shoulder and walks through the main gate of the base.]

Leon: Ashley. There you are. Spotlights... Let's avoid those. Look at all these busy bees. Better watch my step if I don't want to get stung.

[In the caves leading to the entrance to the base Leon discovers another Merchant who was able to get even here!]

Merchant: I've got some new items in stock, heheh. Come, take a look! Welcome! Got some rare things on sale, stranger. That cash in your pocket or your life? Easy choice, mate..Easy work. Heheheheh, thank you. Pleasant travels.

[When Leon approaches the base gate, the alarm goes off.]

Leon: Damn it!

[The gate opens and a strong ganado with a wild boar's head emerges from it. A submachine gun is attached to one of his arms. Leon is attacked from all sides.]

Leon: Sorry, must've slipped. Not bad, right? Next? Outta the way! They keep coming! A rocket launcher!? This isn't good!

[He soon finds a way into the interior of the military base.]

Leon: This where they're keeping Ashley?

Leon: You're serious? Give me a break already. Doesn't look like I can get in through here. Need to find another way.

[After some time of wandering through dark corridors and eliminating ganados, Leon finds the barred room in which Ashley lies.]

Leon: Ashley! Ashley! Come on, Ashley! Wake up! Shit!

[She appears to be unconscious. Leon starts looking for a way to get inside this room and save his ward. He finds the elevator, but it's locked.]

Leon: Need a keycard.

[As he makes his way through the corridors, he finds another shop of the Merchant, who was having lunch at the time.]

Merchant: Oh... Break's over, I suppose! Bigger is better, as they say. Least, I thought so when I was a lad...heheh. Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… Pleasant travels.

[Leon continues his journey through the gloomy laboratory that seems abandoned. There are boxes scattered in different corners, and various personal items on the shelves, indicating that people left the place in a hurry. The lab itself is submerged in semi-darkness as most of the light bulbs do not work. After wandering through the corridors, Leon finds an interesting report.]

[Subject Analysis: Regenerador]
Date: April 9
At last, I have created new life. I call it "Regenerador."
Its metabolic capacity is incredible. Unless all the parasites residing within the organism are destroyed, its tissue can regenerate indefinitely.

Date: April 10
Upon examining the body with a biosensor scope. I was able to confirm that the parasites behave like vital organs for the host, almost as though it has multiple hearts!
This new creation of mine is essentially immortal.
Surely, even Dr. Frankenstein himself would want to shake my hand in admiration!

Date: April 13
I shared the news of my achievement with that pretentious bastard colleague of mine. His face went white! Then, he started scribbling something in his notebook. I thought he'd be impressed, but instead he actually had the nerve to warn me of the so-called dangers.
He's a fool. I have everything under control.

Date:
The subject went wild and escaped from its cryogenic tank.
I was the real fool.

[After reading the report, Leon finds a human body not far from it, with needles stuck in its head from some mechanism that came from nightmares.]

Leon: Christ... What kind of experiments are they doing here?

[And at that moment, a naked body enters the room, but it does not look human at all. The face of the monster has a huge mouth with many sharp teeth. The body of the monster looks like a fat man who has lost a considerable amount of his weight.]

Leon: ...The fuck are you?

[He throws a grenade at the monster.]

Leon: Present for you.

[However, the creature has no intention of dying. Despite its lack of mobility, it makes up for it with nimble leaps and incredible survivability. It seems that this creature refuses to die at all.]

Leon: C'mon!

[He uses the maximum of his arsenal. After a hard fight Leon finally defeats the regenerant and it explodes into a stinking black sludge. After a while Leon has to visit the refrigeration room where the bodies are stored. There he meets another regenerant.]

Leon: Shit! Again!?

[This time he decides not to fight and just takes the key card and runs away.]

[Case 2002-f: Escaped Test Subject]
During a recent power outage, a test subject awoke from cryogenic stasis, broke out of its holding tank, and escaped.
The subject was contained after 20 hours, leaving 7 dead and 19 wounded. We were unable to recover one of the bodies and a tool from inside it.
The cause of this unfortunate incident is the unstable power supply. The outdated generators cannot keep up with our demanding schedule.
Management must prioritize the needs of the engineers over those of the researchers to prevent something like this ever happening again.

[Leon finds a biosensor and installs it on his sniper rifle. Thanks to this remarkable device he is able to detect the weak points of the regenerants as well as the objects inside them. In this way he obtains a crescent wrench that helps him get to the cameras.]

Leon: Ashley!

[He runs up to the girl and cuts the bandage with which her hands are tied behind her back. Ashley lies unconscious. Her veins are blackened.]

Leon: Shit.

[He decides to give her an injection anyway, and for some reason he does it somewhere in her throat. The color of the girl's veins returns to normal.]

Leon: You're gonna be OK.

[But Leon isn't feeling that well himself, so he decides to sit down and rest next to the girl while she recovers. He checks the number of rounds in his gun.]

Chapter 14
[Ashley regains consciousness.]

Ashley: Leon?

Leon: Sorry I'm late.

Ashley: No. Thank you. You brought the medicine just in time.

Leon: Can you stand?

Ashley: Where's Luis?

Leon: He was worried about you...until the end.

[The girl understands without a word what happened.]

Leon: Come on. We don't have much time. Let's get rid of these things.

Ashley: For Luis.

[Leon calls Ada on the radio.]

Leon: Ada, come in. There's a lab where we can remove the parasites. Had a crazy hunch that you'd know where it is.

Ada: Their most important facilities are housed in their sanctuary at the top of the mountain. That's where I'd look.

Leon: Huh. Ada the encyclopedia.

Ada: Happy to help. Now you owe me.

[Captive Researcher's Note]
We were imprisoned without warning.
One by one we are taken to the next room. I do not know what happens there.
They just took Anabel. I am probably next. I've got to think! Need to get my head straight!
All who are infected with the plaga will be at the mercy of Lord Saddler.
If he commands it, they will work themselves to death with a smile on their face.
Adversely, the host becomes so simple-minded that they're basically useless for any complex task.
However, we succeeded in developing the new, superior species of plaga. It has no special variability, but the host's cognitive functions are not diminished.
It seems like they plan to administer this new species to the girl. It's clearly important that she maintains her intelligence after infection.
All tests were successful and plans for mass production are moving forward. The project is a complete success!
But I've been imprisoned.
And preparations to inject me with the superior species are underway in the next room.
Anabel is not herself anymore.
The smile has been wiped completely from her face. Writing is the only thing that keeps me sane now.
Not that anyone will ever read this.

[Leon needs to throw Ashley over the wall again so that she can open the door. This time she's acting very confident.]

Leon: You got it?

Ashley: Pfft, duh!

Leon: I'm counting on ya.

[Ashley opens the door on the other side.]

Ashley: I'm pretty much a master of unlocking!

[Leon is another Merchant's store.]

Merchant: Got some new wares, stranger. You're in for a treat. Welcome! Got something new for ya. Easy work. Good luck to you, stranger. Come back anytime. Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave..Heheheheh, thank you. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see…

[They go outside to the road in the mountains, which are blocked by roadblocks.]

Ashley: Let's find another way.

[They have to fight their way through crowds of enemies. One of the ganados throws an axe at Ashley.]

Leon: Ashley! You OK?

Ashley: Yeah.

[Ganado with axes runs up to Leon.]

Ashley: Watch out!

[Leon turns around and kills him with an accurate crossbow shot to the head. He then shoots down all five blue emblems in the vicinity.]

Ashley: Awesome!

[Leon goes inside the checkpoint.]

Ashley: Be careful.

[Leon throws a grenade into a crowd of enemies.]

Ashley: Give me a warning next time!

[The damaged ganado mutates after Leon rips his head open with a shot.]

Leon: You're serious?

[They find a switch that returns to its original position after a while.]

Leon: Here, hold this down.

Ashley: 'K.

[While he is solving the puzzle he hears that Ashley has been attacked.]

Leon: Ashley!

Ashley: Get off me!

Leon: Hey!

[He kills the attackers.]

Ashley: Thanks.

Leon: Anytime.

[They have to wade through a sewer with a stinking green slurry.]

Leon: Smells pretty bad. You OK?

Ashley: Yeah. Before, this would have killed me, though.

[On the other side of the gutter, they find a door locked with a double lock.]

Leon: We go at the same time, yeah?

Ashley: Got it!

Leon: OK. We go at the same time.

Ashley: Yeah, OK. Yeah!

Leon: Wait here.

Ashley: No prob.

[Leon is attacked by a regenerator, but thanks to the biosensor, he kills him pretty quickly... at least that's what he thought.]

Leon: What the fuck!?

[The regenerant instantly rebuilds the upper part of his body.]

Leon: Die, you stubborn son of a bitch!

[This is a new type of regenerate that is slightly stronger than its counterparts. They have many more veins that need to be shot before they die.]

Leon: Jesus. Cuddly bastard.

Ashley: You're not hurt, are you?

Leon: No, I'm good. Get that lever.

Ashley: OK.

[They enter the room completely without light.]

Leon: No power. 

[Leon finds a valve, a rising bridge. He decides to give Ashley a chance to prove herself.]

Leon: Get this for me!

Ashley: Leave it to me! I'm actually pretty good at this stuff.

[She begins to turn the valve briskly. While he surveys the opposite side Ashley is attacked again by someone.]

Leon: Ashley! Damn it!

Ashley: Get real! Jerk! Over here!

Leon: Shit!

Ashley: Get off me!

Leon: Ashley, are you all right?

Ashley: Yeah, thanks.

[She opens the door.]

Leon: Thanks.

Ashley: You're welcome.

[They find the Merchant's shop.]

Merchant: So that's a request, done and dusted, eh? Good stuff, mate. Well look at you, mate! Oh, what're ya buyin'? So, which weapon will you be givin' a shine to? Give us a shout when you want to tune it up. Well then. What can I do you for? I'll buy almost anything. Ah... I'll buy it at a high price. You'll get some bang for your buck, I guarantee it. Stocking up while you can? Wise choice. I don't always have this in stock, stranger. Good as new. Easy work. Where you gonna put this, your pocket!?.Honestly, this might be the only gun you need… Hard times, mate… Nice catch.

[Leon and Ashley enter a vast hangar at the far end of which there is a fragile wall with a crack in the center of the point through which Ashley notices an elevator taking him to the top of the mountain.]

Ashley: Leon! Look.

Leon: That the lift?

Ashley: If we could do something about this wall…

[Leon approaches a Demolator, so conveniently located right in the hangar.]

Leon: A wrecking ball.

[Ashley climbs into the cabin with the speed of a bullet and closes the door.]

Ashley: I got this!

Leon: Hey! You're serious?

[Ashley easily starts up the machine and sets it in motion. Leon has no choice but to climb up onto the platform and ride along with her.]

Leon: Is this what they teach kids in school these days?

Ashley: Have you never heard of driver's ed? Get back!

[She unfolds the demolition jib and strikes the wall for the first time. The ganados run in.]

Ashley: Leon!

Leon: Leave our friends to me!

[While Ashley is breaking down the wall, Leon is protecting the Demolator.]

Ashley: Leon! Here we go! It's gonna take more than that. One more time! Take this! Come on! Break you freaking wall! Here we go! The hole's getting bigger! Almost there!

Leon: If you all want a beating that bad, I'm happy to oblige. Outta the way!

[Ashley breaks down the wall.]

Ashley: Yeah! That did it! Did you see me? That was awesome!

Leon: I think you might have found your calling.

[They run into the elevator and start to go up.]

Ashley: You know, I... I was thinking—we work well together, don't we?

Leon: I guess so.

Ashley: Right!? Maybe someday, I'll become an agent like you? What do you think? We could protect the US from any and all threats!

Leon: Is that right? Well, either way, first we have to make it out of here.

Ashley: Hm, you're no fun.

Leon: This must be what Luis was talking about.

[They find a huge lump of amber with las plagas frozen inside. Suddenly a familiar character, whom they really meet for the first time, approaches them.]

Saddler: Prostrate yourselves! This is our Holy Body. Our divine providence! And soon… such a profound blessing for all...las plagas! Welcome, my children. I am Osmund Saddler. The speaker for our Lord.

Leon: Tell someone who gives a shit.

[He immediately shoots Saddler.]

Saddler: Foolish lambs. Why do you deny grace?

[He waves his hand and Leon and Ashley fall to their knees.]

Saddler: Now, abandon your body! Obey. Obey the voice of our Lord.

[He forces Ashley to raise her gun.]

Ashley: No… no! Stop! No!

[She shoots... but not at Leon, but at the fanatic to his left.]

Saddler: Sweet child, do not resist!

[Ashley next kills the fanatic to Leon's right. When it's time to shoot Leon himself, the bullet jams in the gun.]

Saddler: Pray, forgive these wicked sinners. My faithful disciple shall deliver
to you your...penance. Now child, you need not be afraid. Submit your body and release yourself from fear!

[He takes Ashley away.]

Leon: Saddler, you bastard!

[He sets out in pursuit of the cultist.]

[Superior Species Report]
Dearest Lord Saddler
I am overjoyed to report wonderful news! Production of the superior species of las plagas is officially underway.
If all goes accordingly, rest assured that we will reach our ultimate goal.
No one can oppose the strength of your dominance, my lord.
On the contrary, who would resist once they experience the utter joy that accompanies the absence of free will?
I am living proof. How ignorant I once was.
In a few days, I will have finished administrating the plaga to all the high-ranking researchers, and then they too shall know.
And when your plan is complete, the whole world shall know!
Anabel García Escudero, Head Researcher

[Leon goes through the mercenary base.]

[***** Case File]
Operation Javier.
Few people have heard the name, even within the highest ranks of the US government. And little wonder too, the operation was not made public. It was conducted in secret, and then buried..
The reason being—it was too inhumane.
It all started back in 2002 when a small unit of US special forces was sent to infiltrate an area of South America
Their mission was to eradicate the drug cartels. The whole operation took several years to prepare for and only the most elite soldiers were selected to participate.
I don't know if the mission was a failure or not, but I do know the fate of those elite soldiers once it was over.
Apparently, the entire unit was wiped out except for the commanding officer, Major *******. And not by the cartels, but by the US.
It shouldn't have been difficult to extract a single stranded unit. All it would have taken was a single helicopter. But for some reason, the military didn't act
Rumors say that the decision was the outcome of a power struggle among the top brass, others say it was a directive from the former president himself. But we may never know the truth since it was all covered up.
But I'm certain of one thing.
The US government let those people die. Brave, young people who dedicated their lives to protect their country.
I want to expose this crime, not because it's my responsibility as a reporter, but because it's my duty as a fellow American.

Note 1:
This document concerns Operation Javier and was written by an American journalist named *******.

Note 2:
This article will never be published. ****** has already been taken care of.

[At the mercenary base, Leon finds a tape recorder with a message recorded for him.]

Krauser: (recorded) You've done well to make it this far, rookie. I've prepared a battlefield up ahead, just for us soldiers. Watered by the blood of generations, hundreds of years, the perfect place to put an end to what happened two years ago.

[Leon finds yet another Merchant’s shop.]

Merchant: Nothing but the finest wares! Welcome! Oh, what're ya buyin'? I'll buy almost anything. Stranger! Oooh, I'll pay a pretty penny for that. What can I interest you in? Let us know when you've made some room. Not my place to say, really, but sometimes things are more interesting if you keep a level playing field, don't you find? Pleasant travels. Easy work. Good as new. See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away. Anything else I can 'elp you with? Come back anytime.

[After replenishing his supplies, he goes to the place where he is supposed to meet Krauser - the ancient ruins near the camp.]

Krauser: I've been waiting for you, rookie. Oh, worried about the girl, is that it? Hmm, that's just like you. You always had poor judgment. But if you think I'm going to let you out of here alive… you're even more naive than I thought. You can't save her. You can't save anyone!

Leon: Give it up, Krauser! Being a lackey for these maniacs… won't bring your men back. And what the hell for? Revenge on the government? You think they would want that?

Krauser: Revenge? You think I'm doing all this… for revenge?

Leon: Isn't that what this is all about?

Krauser: You see, in that jungle, I had a revelation. The most important thing in this world is pure, unadulterated power! Los Iluminados have given me that.

Leon: You know, you were always an asshole. But at least you had some kind of code, some honor! And look at you now.

Krauser: Enough reminiscing. Move out and draw fire, soldier.

[He opens fire with an assault rifle. Leon hides behind the rubble of a column.]

Krauser: Better run, rookie!

Leon: Not like I have a choice.

Krauser: What's wrong? Show no mercy! Where's your instinct!? You're slow. And so goddamn weak. Guess I'll make the first move! Way too slow! I don't remember teaching you to move like that.

Leon: But you did teach me never to match the enemy's pace.

Krauser: Don't stop moving, soldier! You better hustle. Who knows what's become of the girl. 

[He lures Leon into catacombs riddled with traps.]

Krauser: You remember the fight in the jungle? We barely made it out alive.

Leon: "Go with your gut! Don't think!" That was the first thing you taught me. He's turned this place into one big trap. I can't fight him on his terms.

Krauser: Ready to die, rookie? I'm no stranger to covert tactics, remember?

Leon: How could I forget! Shit!

Krauser: I love a good hunt! Still alive, huh? You got lucky! I admit—you've done well to stay alive this long.

Leon: I'd be dead if I kept listening to people like you!

Krauser: The reaper comes for cowards and the careless alike. Which are you?

Leon: I dunno. Guess I'll ask when I see him. Well, you've really gone all out for me. You shouldn't have!

Krauser: You've passed with flying colors. Here's your medal! This is it, soldier!

Leon: You're really doing this? It's not too late!

Krauser: You and me are two sides of the same coin. I guess that means we'll never see eye to eye. You've made it all this way, but you haven't learned a thing! I have to say, I'm disappointed.

Krauser: From you, I take that as a compliment.

[They start fighting in close combat using knives.]

Krauser: You and I have chosen different paths. All that's left now is to settle this the old-fashioned way.

Leon: I was thinking the same thing, Krauser. Let's finish this, Krauser.

Krauser: Shut your mouth! You wouldn't want to die with it open! You can't beat me!

[Finally the fight stops. Krauser took enough damage to lose the ability to move.]

Leon: Are we done here, Krauser? I told you again and again… You're too soft to do what's necessary.

[But Krauser begins to mutate. His right arm turns into a blade.]

Krauser: That's the difference between you and me, rookie. 

[He jumps off the half-destroyed building he was standing on with a mighty jerk. Leon tries to avoid the collision, but the impact destroys the floor beneath him and he falls into the underground part of the ruins.]

Krauser: Time to finish… your training.

[It's pitch black all around, and only the flashlight allows Leon to see anything.]

Krauser: Witness the power!

Leon: You've lost it completely, Krauser.

Krauser: Here I come!

Leon: So that's your true power? Oh, I'd ask for a refund.

Krauser: You're gonna regret that smart mouth of yours. You're not getting away! I can't wait to see you writhe!

[Ignoring his ramblings or he runs to the exit of the ruins however the bridge rises right before his eyes.]

Leon: Shit!

[Krauser appears behind him.]

Krauser: Training's not done. Last lesson starts right now.

Leon: Nah. Time for the teacher to be taught.

Leon: Such confidence. Bring it, rookie!

[The final stage of the battle begins!]

Krauser: Are you ready, rookie?

Leon: Yeah. Let's settle this.

Krauser: I'm not surprised you made it this far! Not bad, but I didn't expect anything less. After all, I know your potential better than anyone. It's a damn shame you can't see the truth. How long do you plan to fight in that primitive body of yours?

Leon: Until the mission's finished. You'd have said the same once.

Krauser: You need to stop living in the past. Give up! My strength is without equal! Strength is everything. The weak can protect nothing!

Leon: The way you're going, there won't be anything left to protect! You'd have known that once!

Krauser: That's where you're wrong! I didn't know a damn thing! Now I do! You can't deny this power! Imagine the strength you'd have!

Leon: And turn into a freak like you? You gotta be out of your mind!

Krauser: Always trying to get the last word. Come here, I'll beat that out of you. Hahaha... Yes! This is the moment I've been waiting for!

[Leon wins the fight. Krauser falls to the wooden floor and cannot get up.]

Krauser: Do...what you have to do.

[Leon picks up his commander's knife.]

Krauser: That's right.

[Leon, hesitating a bit, still stabs Crowther in the heart.]

Krauser: I trained you well… Leon.

[He dies.]

Leon: That you did, Major. That you did.

[He continues to pursue Saddler, who now has Ashley. As he leaves, Leon looks back at his commander's corpse and leaves, raising the bridge behind him.]

Chapter 15
[As I ascend to the summit, Leon surveys further fortifications through binoculars.]

Leon: Their defenses are no joke. That's gotta be their sanctuary. Ashley!

[On the way to the summit, he finds the Merchant's store, which seems to have been having lunch.]

Merchant: Oh... Break's over, I suppose! Welcome! Oh, what're ya buyin'? Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Heheheheh, thank you. Don't get yourself killed now, haha. Knife needs care every once in a while. Could be the difference between life and death. See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away. Easy work. There you are, as you wished.

[Having upgraded his equipment Leon begins his attack on the fortification. As soon as he comes to the gate ganados at the entrance cover with a barrage of fire and they all die.]

Leon: What was that!?

[A helicopter hovers over him.]

Loudspeaker: Sorry, bad traffic! One combat chopper, compliments of Hunnigan! Call me Mike. Now let's show these assholes what we got!

Leon: Hunnigan... I owe you one.

Mike: Oh yeah, more customers! Lure them into an open area! I'll give them what they came for!

[Mike is very much helping Leon destroy a crowd of enemies.]

Leon: Damn it! They keep coming!

[Mike destroys the barrier with a rocket.]

Mike: Jackpot! All right, go go go! Leave the area up ahead to me! Take break...before you join in on the fun! Hell yeah! What can I say, I never miss!

[Mike is setting up a real apocalypse for the ganados!]

Leon: Huh! Not bad at all!

Mike: Twisty son of a bitch. Oh shit, an AA gun! That's gonna be a problem. Hey, tough guy, do something about that turret! I needed to take a piss anyway.

Leon: Better give him what he wants.

Mike: Hurry up and do something about that gun, would ya!

Leon: Give me a break already.

[He climbs to the top of a nearby tower fighting an army of enemies. At the top he finds a machine gun and starts firing at the turret on the opposite tower.]

Leon: Time for a taste of your own medicine.

[He destroys the turret.]

Leon: Mike! All clear!

Mike: Thanks, buddy! All right, now watch me do my thing! Gate's open! Go get rowdy! Bad news—I'm out of ammo! You'll have to handle this one on your own! Don't worry, you got this! I bet you won't even break a sweat!

Leon: All right.

[He has to fight off the hordes of ganados with his own resources, but Mike has not abandoned him. Soon he flies up to Leon as he enters the open countryside.]

Mike: Get in!

Leon: Thanks!

Mike: When we get out of here, drinks are on me. I know a good bar.

[He drops a rope ladder for Leon.]

Mike: Yeah, keep your head down! Nice and slow. What the—!?

[Something clings to his helicopter. It's two huge monsters that look like meaty grasshoppers.]

Leon: No...Mike!

[The helicopter loses control, catches fire and falls directly on Leon. He manages to dodge it. Mike continues to fight for his life in the burning helicopter, but he falls and the helicopter explodes. In the background of the explosion, Saddler approaches Leon with his living staff.]

Leon: Saddler!

[He sets his grasshoppers on Leon and leaves.]

Leon: I'll make sure you're the next to go, Saddler. They keep coming! 

[He walks into a building where it looks like there was some kind of fight...]

Leon: What the…

[Biological Specimen Transfer]
The repairs were completed without issue. Since the facility was previously used for confinement, the work required to reinforce the airtight sealing was minimal.
And as long as we don't run into any issues with the cooling system test, we plan to bring in all of the remaining specimens from Facility 1.
All specimens were successfully transferred. However, we experienced a slight hiccup during transport as one of them became violent. Luckily, the number of casualties was less than anticipated.
Please be extra careful when dealing with them. We have received reports that they are beginning to acquire a tolerance to the low temperatures.

[Soon he comes across another Merchant's shop.]

Merchant: Nothing but the finest wares! Welcome! What can I interest you in? Better to be overprepared, am I right? Pleasant travels.

[He goes outside again and walks to the top, making his way through the fortifications in the dilapidated castle.]

Leon: Almost there... Ashley, I'm coming.

[He makes his way to the castle on top and enters a room with an altar that we could see in the opening cutscene, but now this room is lit by many candles and a huge chandelier above. Leon notices Ashley lying on the altar.]

Leon: Ashley!

[He tries to touch her, but some unknown force stops his hand. The girl's face, or rather the veins in her face, have already turned black. Just like the rest of her body.]

Saddler: You have come, my child.

Leon: What...do you want?

Saddler: I simply wish to share this gift with as many as possible. A humble wish, don't you think? You see, we are all connected through the Holy Body. And now your flesh and bones, your very thoughts… are already one with us.

Leon: Bullshit.

Saddler: Why do you reject serenity? When you need only accept the sacred gift? Like...she did.

Leon: Saddler!

Saddler: Ah yes. The time has come… for this lamb to join our covenant! Oh, blessings unto him and the sweet mercy they bring. Exult all—and let it be so!

[Suddenly his tirade is interrupted by a burst of machine gun fire. Someone standing on the balcony kills his fanatics and awards several shots to Saddler himself.]

Ada: Leon! Go!

[She continues to shoot, preventing Saddler from regaining control of Leon. Leon runs up to Ashley. He takes the girl in his arms and runs away, while Ada's clip runs out of ammunition. Saddler runs after Leon, but Ada fires her gun at the chain holding the stone statue that blocks the passage behind Leon.]

Leon: Ashley... Ashley? Damn it. 

[Wounded and with Ashley in his arms, he treads heavily and leans against the wall of the floor map.]

Leon: Laboratory B... Looks like it's this way.

[The corridor changes right in front of his eyes, but quickly returns to normal. He seems to be hallucinating.]

Leon: The hell?

Галлюцинация повторяется но теперь она продолжается дольше.

Leon: Fuck. I'm losing it.

[He tries to open the door to the lab, but it is propped up by the table on the other side. Since he is exhausted, even such a trivial task is difficult for him.]

Saddler: (via telepathy) Still you resist, child.

Leon: Shut up!

[With a mighty effort, he breaks down the door. The hallucinations continue.]

Leon: Enough! God damn it.

[He manages to get to the lab and use Luis's Key. Leon walks hard to the medical chair.]

Leon: This time… it has to be different. 

Ashley: You go first.

Leon: No way. Like I told you, I'm gonna get you home safe. Here goes nothing.

[He presses a few buttons to activate a medical laser, on the screen of which we see a parasite sitting inside the girl. Three invisible blue beams burn out the parasite and Ashley screams terribly. Leon tries to hold her so she doesn't twist. After a few minutes of suffering, the operation is successfully completed and the parasite is completely burned out. A joyful Leon faints.]

Chapter 16
[When Leon regains consciousness, the three blue lasers are already returning to their place, indicating a successful operation.]

Leon: Ashley...? Ashley...?

Ashley: I'm right here.

[She embraces her savior.]

Ashley: I thought you were gonna die.

Leon: You did this?

Ashley: Yeah. Yeah I did this. Can you stand?

[Leon shakes a little after the surgery and Ashley stretches out her arms to keep him from falling.]

Leon: That a map?

Ashley: Yeah, I found it. I think it says we can get out if we go...this way. Hey, we're a team, right?

Leon: Keep this up? I'll be out of a job.

Ashley: So, all of this? Removing the parasites... This was Luis?

Yeah. We're alive. Thanks to him.

[Methods for Eradicating Las Plagas]
There are two ways to eradicate las plagas: antigen injection and surgery.
If the parasite has not hatched yet. it can be treated by administering antigen directly into the body,
Once it has hatched however, there's not much that can be done besides slow its growth.
With surgery, the plaga can be targeted and killed using a certain wavelength of radiation.
But this is not without its risks. If the parasite has attached itself to the host's nervous system, the host will experience excruciating pain. And there is no effective anesthesia for this kind of procedure.
Surgical removal carries considerable risks, even before the parasite has fully developed.
Once fully grown however, it is too late: removing the parasite would kill the host.
But considering what will happen to them, death may be a mercy.

[He walks over to the computer that controlled the laser and it turns out to be a desktop computer with a horizontal system unit that was popular in the eighties.]

Leon: I'm surprised this thing even booted up.

[Saddler's Animus]
Do not be fooled into thinking that las plagas are merely tools for creating powerful bioweapons. Their true value lies in their ability to control.
No matter how hostile the subject, a single injection can turn anyone into a faithful servant. Who needs spies when you can turn yesterday's enemy into today's ally?
Controlling just one insider can bring an entire organization-an entire country-to its knees.
Mass production of the superior species has made this possible. We have empowered Saddler.
It is clear what he intends to do next.
Can you imagine if Saddler had that much control?
Six billion loyal servants at his sole command. There would be no opposition, no war.
Maybe for the first time in human history, the world would know peace.
But I know how Saddler and the others have oppressed the people of this island for generations. I know how he treats them.
That's no way to live. And because of that, I won't let it happen.

[The Amber]
This sample, which I've come to call "the Amber." was just sitting in the storeroom collecting dust.
We used to have ample specimens for experimentation in the past, so it makes sense that this one was overlooked.
In fact, the only reason I brought it back to my lab was because of its peculiar shape.
After a basic analysis, I've changed my mind.
The Amber possesses a very unique quality. Although small and in a suspended state, it contains the same organ found in the "dominant species", which we've only seen in Saddler himself.
When fully developed, the Amber may rival, or perhaps even surpass, Saddler's power.
Unfortunately, the Amber was confiscated by Saddler before I could make any further progress in my research. He may be onto me.
I need to get my hands on that sample again and escape in order to continue my research elsewhere. It's the only way to counter Saddler.
Of course, I don't think I can trust this outside group either, but I've already come this far.
Hopefully I can sweet talk my way out of this one too.
I'll have to. For the world's sake.

[Emails]
Subject: Regarding our arrangement From: Luis
I've compiled the research data that you wanted. Meet me at the designated time and place.
To be clear: you're going to get me the hell out of here if I bring you the goods, right?

Subject: Re: Regarding our arrangement From: A.W.
I hope you haven't forgotten about the Amber, Without it, the data is worthless, It would be a shame to let your seal go to waste, so do not make me return empty-handed.
You still remember the code phrase, I assume?

Subject: Re: Re: Regarding our arrangement
From: Luis
Relax, I haven't forgotten.
And don't worry about the Amber. I'll figure something out.
Think you can pick me up a pack of smokes on the way? Any brand is fine.

Leon: Someone had a field day looting the Umbrella labs…

[They walk out of the lab and into the warehouse. Leon again has to give Ashley a lift to watch the top floor.]

Leon: Sorry.

Ashley: Like I said, we're a team!

Leon: You're getting good at that.

Ashley: Right?

[She brings the ladder down for him and Leon climbs up to the second floor as well.]

Ashley: You sure you're OK?

Leon: Never been better.

Ashley: Good.

[They get into the caves.]

Ashley: Look at this place! That woman who helped us... do you think she's all right?

Leon: Oh, I'm sure she's fine. She's not the type to roll over that easy.

Ashley: Sounds like you know her well… Hey, wait! Leon!

[They walk back out to the altar. Leon reads a huge book on a stone pedestal.]

[Iluminados Final Chapter]
Praise be to the holy insects!
We have been promised paradise on earth!
Man, woman, or child!
His love does not discriminate! Beast, fish, or bird!
All creatures shall be equally blessed!
Praise be to the holy insects! We are the humble servants of God!
His wisdom will overcome any mountain!
His omnipotence will cross any ocean!
The light of heaven dwells in all things!
Let our bodies be the seedbed!
Praise be to the holy insects! 
We are the flock and the shepherd guides us!
Our prayers will be sung all over the world! They will be heard by all! 
At last, we shall exceed the stars in the sky!

Ashley: Where are you going!? Don't leave me!

[Leon runs to the Merchant to replenish his supplies. Since Saddler is hiding somewhere it is worth preparing for trouble.]

Merchant: Nothing but the finest wares! Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. Heheheheh, thank you. There's some things money can't buy. Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend. Try that on for size. Anything else I can 'elp you with? Lightweight and easy to handle, this weapon has a lot of power.

[They go out into the wide open area.]

Ashley: Leon, look! Is that-?

Leon: Ada!

[She is tied by the hands with a chain to a steel tower.]

Leon: He thinks he's going to lure me out. Stay here. I won't be long.

Ashley: Okay.

[He takes the elevator down to save his longtime girlfriend.]

Leon: Ada!

[With one shot, he breaks the chain and Ada falls to the ground. The trap, meanwhile, slams shut - the insects block Leon's way back. They attack him until Saddler himself approaches him.]

Leon: Saddler!

[He prepares to shoot but Saddler grabs him with the tentacle that has grown from his arm. The freed Ada uses her hook gun and pushes Saddler, standing next to Leon and getting ready to fight. They shoot at Saddler, however the bullets don't even scratch him.]

Saddler: You foul renegade! You have forsaken the Holy Body… the great gift...to become one with us. You require ABSOLUTION!

[He turns into a monster, a living symbol of his faith. Saddler attacks the heroes but they cleverly evade. The final battle begins!]

Saddler: Such blasphemous desecration! Such unforgivable heresy! Yet, is it not the sinner who is in most need of salvation?

[After a brief battle, the Saddler monster falls into an abyss, after which it becomes even larger. It throws Lyon away with one of its own and he clings to the edge of the metal tower.]

Leon: I'm getting sick of your shit!

[Dodging the tentacles, he runs to the very center of the monster where the huge yellow eye is located.]

Leon: Finally a look that suits you, Saddler. A monster in and out. Still, I need to cut this date short. It's not me, it's you.

Ada: Use this!

[She throws him a rocket launcher. Leon shoots it into his eye and it explodes, exposing Saddler's true body inside. With powerful leaps Leon runs up to him.]

Leon: I'll give you a holy body!

[He takes Saddler's staff and stabs him with it. Saddler's body begins to disintegrate and Leon is thrown back. He loses consciousness for a few minutes and when he comes to, he finds The Amber capsule next to him. Ada comes over and picks it up.]

Leon: Ada. What the hell are you doing?

Ada: Nothing personal, Leon. Luis and I had an arrangement. Don't worry, I'll take good care of it.

[A helicopter flies up to her.]

Ada: Ride's here. You coming?

Leon: I think we both know this is where we go our separate ways.

Ada: I see.

[She gets into a helicopter that goes up in the air. The whole complex begins to explode.]

Ada: Better get a move on.

[She throws him a key with a little teddy bear.]

Leon: Cute.

Ada: Until next time, Leon.

Ashley: Leon! Where's she going?

Leon: Who knows.

Ashley: I don't understand. Why would she just—?

[Another explosion occurs.]

Leon: Better move. Island's gonna blow.

Ashley: It's gonna WHAT!?

Leon: Yeah.

[Now they have only two minutes to leave the complex.]

Leon: OK, let's get out of here!

Ashley: Yeah! Now we can go home!

Leon: We're not outta here yet.

[He helps Ashley jump over the crevasse.]

Ashley: Thanks.

[The ganados in their way are lying on the floor and throwing up black slop.]

Ashley: They're not attacking. What's going on?

Leon: They're nothing now their master's gone. It's over for them.

All right. Not bad, Ada.

[They run up to a water scooter.]

Leon: You like thrill rides?

Ashley: I love them!

Leon: You're gonna love this!

[They rush at breakneck speed through the gutter tunnels of the complex.]

Leon: Hold on! 

[After a minute of deadly racing, they fly out of the crumbling complex into the open ocean.]

Leon: You all right?

Ashley: I'm not sure! That was insane! 

[The complex explodes, showering the heroes with light rain instead of small sharp fragments. Ashley looks out at the sunset.]

Ashley: Mission accomplished, right?

Leon: Mission accomplished...when you're home safe.

Ashley: Thank you for saving me.

Leon: Don't mention it.

Ashley: You know, I could put in a word with my dad. Have you assigned to my detail, if you're interested?

Leon: You don't need me. You proved you can handle yourself. Even if you could use a lesson in knife safety. Come on, let's go home.

[They sail off into the sunset. In the background we hear Hunnigan going crazy, because Leon hasn't been in touch for hours.]

Hunnigan: Condor One? Roost to Condor One! Do you read me? Come in! I said come in! Is this thing even on? Leon! Leon! Are you and Ashley all right? Where are you? Come on!

[New scene. Ada looks at The Amber in her helicopter, then carefully places it in her suitcase.]

Ada: Patch me through.

[The pilot presses something on the panel and gives her the signal that everything is okay.]

Ada: I've obtained "the Amber."

Albert Wesker: Excellent.

Ada: Just one question. What are you planning to do with this?

Albert Wesker: I do not pay you to ask questions. All you need to know is a new dawn is breaking. A hundred will give their lives so that just one may live. I am expediting that change.

Ada: So, we're talking millions of casualties.

Albert Wesker: Billions.

Ada: How ambitious.

[She pulls out a gun and points it at the pilot.]

Ada: We're changing course. Now.

[The helicopter turns around and Ada sees through the window of the porthole Leon's scooter passing by, which looks like he's going to cross the whole ocean.]

THE END
