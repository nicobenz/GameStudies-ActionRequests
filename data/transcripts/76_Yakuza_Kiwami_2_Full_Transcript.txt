This game series puts a very strong emphasis on the story. If you haven‚Äôt played the previous games or already forgot what events happened in them, I recommend you to read the first game Yakuza 0 and then its sequel - Yakuza Kiwami before reading this text. Enjoy!

This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, businesses, places, events and incidents are either the products of the author‚Äôs imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

Chapter 1: LETTER OF BLOOD
[We get to a discotheque. Everyone is having fun and dancing.]

The Early 80s
Kamurocho, Tokyo

[The harsh looking man in a long light brown coat enters the discotheque. He goes out the back door and comes to the door of the neighboring building. The man takes out a revolver and, having prepared himself, slowly opens the door. Having looked around, he goes further. Alarm sounds in the building. Shots are heard from far away. The man is hiding behind a pole. The wounded man comes out of the adjoining corridor. He shoots several times, but his killer aptly shoots him in the hand. This killer turns out to be‚Ä¶ Kazama. The man behind the pole looks to look around, attracting Kazama‚Äôs attention. At that moment the wounded man tries to shoot, but Kazama is the first to shoot him in the chest several times.]

Wounded Man: (in Korean) [‚Ä¶You lying dog! Though I die, we‚Äôll live on‚Ä¶ See you in hell!]

[Kazama is leaving. The man in the coat runs up to the wounded.]

Man in Coat: Hey, stay with me‚Ä¶

Wounded Man: My child‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ beg‚Ä¶

[The man wearing the coat runs to the stairs. The top floor is embraced by flames. In one of the rooms he finds a Korean woman with a child.]

Man in Coat: Easy now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not one of them. You‚Äôve got to get out of here! Let me take the kid.

Korean woman: [Stay back! I won‚Äôt let you take my baby!]

[She goes to the window, apparently wanting to jump out of it.]

Man in Coat: Don‚Äôt!

Korean woman: [Let me go! Just let us die!]

[The man slaps her.]

Man in Coat: That kid‚Äôs innocent. Don‚Äôt just throw his life away.

[She hands over the child and falls to the floor without any strength left. Some time passes. The same man sitting in his office. There are boxes around it. He plays with his empty revolver.]

Man in Coat: Been a long damn time‚Ä¶ Some 20-odd years?

[He recalls the words that the wounded Korean man said before he died.]

[‚Ä¶You lying dog! Though I die, we‚Äôll live on‚Ä¶See you in hell!]

[He imaginary loads an empty gun and shoots at something in his office.]

December 14th, 2006
Kamurocho

[Yuya throws away some guy from Stardust.]

Yuya: Thought you‚Äôd come in here and start shit, huh? You think trash like you scares us!?

Man: Hold up.

[Several thugs come to the club. A man thrown out of the club says something to the thugs leader.]

Yuya: You assholes‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre those Chinese punks raising hell at all those clubs, right?

Thugs Leader: If you know us, that make this easier. Give up your money. All of it!

Yuya: We don‚Äôt pay out every shithead who asks. So if you think you can strong-arm us‚Ä¶ (strictly and loudly) You‚Äôll have to go through me first!

Thugs Leader: So Japanese do have balls! (pulls out a knife)

[The gang attacks Yuya, but he defeated them quite easily.]

Yuya: Goddamn foreigners! We‚Äôre not handing over this town to the likes of you!

[The thugs walk away.]

Stardust Employee: Damn, boss‚Ä¶ You the man!

Yuya: (picks up the knife) This town‚Äôs gone to the dogs.

Stardust Employee: You think something‚Äôs going down? Kinda like last year?

Yuya: Man, I hope not. I sure miss Kiryu-san though‚Ä¶

[Next scene. We climb to the top of a giant building made of glass and concrete. On top of it, a good friend of Kazama-san, Osamu Kashiwagi, is smoking in his office.]

[OSAMU KASHIWAGI. Patriarch of the Kazama Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

[A subordinate of his enters.]

Man: Boss. There‚Äôs been an incident outside Stardust.

Kashiwagi: Were they from Kansai?

Man: No, just some foreigners with no sense.

Kashiwagi: ‚Ä¶I see.

Man: Should I put some boys on the watch?

Kashiwagi: Leave it.

Man: But boss, there‚Äôs been some odd guys -

Kashiwagi: (strictly) I said leave it!

Man: Yes, sir.

Kashiwagi: There‚Äôs no telling which spark could ignite a war.

Man: So Kansai is really going to march on Kanto?

Kashiwagi: One of the Omi‚Äôs "Four Kings," Terada, is at the top of our ladder now. And I doubt they‚Äôre very happy about it. One screw-up could land us in an all-out war, and this isn‚Äôt the time for that. You make sure our boys understand‚Ä¶ Nobody even blinks without my okay.

Man: Yes, sir.

[The subordinate leaves. Kashiwagi walks to a window.]

Kashiwagi: (to himself) Do we strike first‚Ä¶ or bait the attack? Kiryu‚Ä¶ How would you handle it?

[We move to the parking lot building where a Korean man talks on his cell phone.]

Korean Man: It‚Äôs been over 20 years‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve been‚Ä¶ waiting for this.

Employer: Whaddaya say we skip the history lesson? Just get those fireworks ready. Ya mind?

Korean Man: Patience, man. This is for all our guys that they took out. We‚Äôve been biding our time‚Ä¶ Waiting for the right moment to exact vengeance.

Employer: Maybe try keepin‚Äô yer pep talk to yourself, before someone hears ya.

Korean Man: Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm a professional. No one notices the fly who stays on the wall.

Employer: Ain‚Äôt that nice. But just so we‚Äôre clear, I ain‚Äôt one of your boys. Seein‚Äô Kamurocho go up in a sea of flames‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the common goal here. Once that‚Äôs done, we‚Äôre strangers. Ya got that?

Korean Man: Sure. You just enjoy the show.

[He hangs up.]

Korean Man: (to himself) A sea of fire‚Äôs not enough. That won‚Äôt put the souls of those who died in vain to rest‚Ä¶

[Then we see the scene of Kazama‚Äôs death from the previous game. It is noteworthy that it is shortened. If you want to recall this scene, I recommend reading the very end of Chapter 12 of the first game.]

Kazama: Please forgive me‚Ä¶ Kazuma‚Ä¶ Your‚Ä¶ Real parents were killed‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶By me.

[After that comes the time of death scenes of Yumi and Nishikiyama. For full perception, I recommend reading the last chapter of the first game.]

Yumi/Mizuki: Whether it was one night‚Ä¶ Or even just one glance‚Ä¶ I wanted to see you once more, Kazuma. And my wish‚Ä¶ was granted.

Nishikiyama: No way I‚Äôm letting this asshole‚Ä¶ get away with it. The responsibility is mine‚Ä¶ So let me do this.

Kiryu: Don‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt do it, Nishiki! Nishiki!

[Kiryu wakes up in sweat.]

Kiryu: Just a dream‚Ä¶

Haruka: What‚Äôs with the look on your face?

Kiryu: Hm? Haruka? Where‚Äôve you been? And what‚Äôs up with the flowers?

Haruka: You said we‚Äôd visit their graves today.

Kiryu: Yeah, I guess I did.

Haruka: Uncle Kaz, are you hungry? I‚Äôll go make us some breakfast.

Kiryu: Thanks‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll help you out.

Haruka: It‚Äôs fine! I can do it myself. I‚Äôve gotten better over the year, right?

Kiryu: You sure have.

[They come to the cemetery to honor the deceased.]

Kiryu: (Hard to believe it‚Äôs been a whole year‚Ä¶ People say time heals all wounds. but sometimes they just become scars. And being here opens them all up again.)

[He comes to Kazama‚Äôs grave.]

Kiryu: (Has a full year passed since Kazama-san died? Last year had such a huge impact on my life‚Ä¶)

[He decides to remember the events from the last year. We see the footage from the first game.]

Kiryu: Last year, I lost some people who were very dear to me. Thinking back, maybe my fate was sealed on that day, 11 years ago. When I was still a part of the Tojo Clan‚Äôs Dojima Family, there were three people I could call my family. One was my best friend from the orphanage where we grew up, Akira Nishikiyama. Another was the man who took me in and raised me like his own son, Shintaro Kazama. And the last‚Ä¶ was the childhood friend I‚Äôd come to love, Yumi Sawamura. For an orphan like me, those three were the closest thing to a family I had. But‚Ä¶

[We see the scene of Dojima murder.]

Nishikiyama: I killed him‚Ä¶ A direct Tojo associate‚Ä¶

Kiryu: (offscreen) What I saw before me was the lifeless body of the Dojima Family patriarch. He‚Äôd tried to force himself on Yumi.

Kiryu: (to Yumi) Hey‚Ä¶ Talk to me! Nishiki. Take Yumi and get out.

Nishikiyama: What about you?

Kiryu: Just go, Nishiki. Take care of Yumi. Go!

Kiryu: To protect the people closest to me‚Ä¶ I made a decision.

[Police burst into the room.]

Prison guard: You may begin eating!

Kiryu: I got 10 years. While I did my time, I got word of my expulsion from the Tojo Clan and Yumi‚Äôs disappearance. I was branded for patricide‚Ä¶ When the clan cut me off, I felt like a kite without a string. But someone on the outside still remembered me.

[He got a letter.]

Kiryu: Kazama-san‚Ä¶

Kiryu: (offscreen) The man I considered my father. When I made parole, I set out to find him. But also to find out what had happened in Kamurocho during the 10 years I was in jail. A lot about the city had changed‚Ä¶

Nishikiyama: In the presence of all the direct clan patriarchs‚Ä¶ Third Chairman, an inquiry‚Ä¶ We all know that the clan‚Äôs funds are held in the safety of Touto Bank‚Ä¶ A sum of 10 billion yen. Is it true then, that it was all stolen?

Kiryu: (offscreen) My former friend had become a different man entirely. And every thug was on the trail of the missing 10 billion.

[Nishikiyama shoots Kazama with a sniper rifle.]

Kiryu: Kazama-san!

Kiryu: (offscreen) A war of succession took root in the Tojo Clan, and I wound up in the middle. Trusting in Kazama-san, I went in search of Yumi, who was connected to everything. But‚Ä¶ Who I found instead‚Ä¶ was a little girl, all alone.

[Kiryu decides to keep remembering the events of the first game.]

Kiryu: (offscreen) Her name was Haruka. She was only nine years old at the time. Haruka had come into the city all by herself to find her mother. We‚Äôd met by pure chance, but there was one thing we had in common.

Kiryu: So what are you going to do now?

Haruka: All I have is my mom and Aunt Yumi. That‚Äôs why‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yumi?

Kiryu: (offscreen) She was looking for her mother, but we were both looking for Yumi. Perhaps it was fate that Haruka and I started searching together. Because then‚Ä¶

Hayashi: We want the little girl ya got there.

Haruka: Huh?

Kiryu: (offscreen) The clan chased her down, believing she was the key to the 10 billion yen. Every day was a new threat‚Ä¶ I followed the trail of Yumi and the 10 billion, protecting Haruka the best I could.

Lau: I knew you‚Äôd come sooner or later.

Kiryu: (offscreen) And along the way, I crossed paths with a detective. Makoto Date‚Ä¶ Formerly a Division One cop. 11 years ago, he‚Äôd interrogated me, and his life fell to pieces afterward. To put his career back on track, he asked for my cooperation.

Date: Kiryu, I‚Äôm currently investigating the murder of Third Chairman Sera. And you‚Äôre gonna help.

Kiryu: (offscreen) A former yakuza partnered with a cop on the same case. It was odd to say the least, but in time, we grew to become friends. Then‚Ä¶

Sudo: Kazuma Kiryu! You‚Äôre under arrest for kidnapping!

Kiryu: (offscreen) Sudo, the Division One chief, closed in on us, and I got cornered.

Kiryu: Date-san?

Date: Sorry it took me this long.

Kiryu: This is gonna be bad for you!

Date: Let‚Äôs go, Kiryu!

Kiryu: (offscreen) Date-san may have been a cop‚Ä¶ But he chose us over the force.

[Kiryu decides to keep remembering.]

Kiryu: (offscreen) The closer we got to the truth, the more people stood in our way. A direct Tojo Clan patriarch after the 10 billion, Futoshi Shimano.

Shimano: We meet again‚Ä¶ Kiryu!

Kiryu: (offscreen) And a captain of the Shimano Family, Goro Majima.

Majima: Yo, Kiryu-chan! Been looking for ya.

Kiryu: (offscreen) Every fight against these yakuza veterans was more fierce than the last. Even Sohei Dojima‚Äôs widow, Yayoi, confronted me for vengeance.

Yayoi: Dojima‚Äôs murderer‚Ä¶ Was it you?

Kiryu: (offscreen) Her words weighed heavy on me. But through it all, some were steadfast in their support. The owner of the Stardust host club, Kazuki, and a host there, Yuya. Terada, from the Omi Alliance. The people Kazama-san led me to gave me the courage to press on. And‚Ä¶ One man we met brought Haruka and me closer to the truth.

The Florist: Kazuma Kiryu. Out on parole and raising hell already, eh?

Kiryu: (offscreen) The Florist of Sai.. A legendary informant concealed beneath Kamurocho.

The Florist: Here it is, Kiryu. Footage from Serena.

Kiryu: (offscreen) His intelligence revealed the man controlling things from the shadows.

Date: The Florist indicated it could belong to an underground government organization. So I looked into it, and he was on the mark. An underground organization called the "MIA."

Kiryu: (offscreen) A politician was tied to the Tojo Clan‚Äôs missing 10 billion. Kyohei Jingu. He‚Äôd embezzled the money through the Tojo Clan. And the clan had been his source of income for years. The theft of that money was committed to protect the Tojo Clan from his influence. Then I learned who was behind it.

Kazama: Kazuma. The ones who stole the money‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Were Yumi, Sera, and I.

Kiryu: (offscreen) We‚Äôd finally uncovered the truth‚Ä¶ But then‚Ä¶

[Shimano throws the grenade.]

Kiryu: Haruka! Kazama-san!

Kiryu: (offscreen) Kazama-san sacrificed himself to protect Haruka, and after revealing the final piece of the puzzle‚Ä¶

Kazama: Please forgive me, Kazuma. Your‚Ä¶ Real parents were killed‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶By me.

Kiryu: It‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs okay, pops. To me‚Ä¶ You were my‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶My true‚Ä¶ (Kazama dies)Father!

Kiryu: (offscreen) He confessed his secret about my past‚Ä¶ And then‚Ä¶ He passed on.

[Kiryu decides to keep remembering.]

Kiryu: (offscreen) After learning the truth, Haruka and I picked up the money‚Äôs trail. The Millennium Tower. Yumi was waiting for us there. Yumi had been Haruka‚Äôs mother all along. It was a joyful reunion‚Ä¶ But their happiness only lasted a moment.

Kiryu: What‚Äôs that!?

Kiryu: (offscreen) Kyohei Jingu came to take back his 10 billion yen. He planned to cut ties with the Tojo Clan and join hands with Kansai‚Äôs Omi Alliance. He hoped to unite Japan‚Äôs political and criminal worlds under his control. He sprung a trap on Kazama-san‚Äôs ally, Terada, the Omi Chief of HQ. Then bared his fangs at us. However‚Ä¶

Jingu: Wh-What!?

[Yumi arms her bomb.]

Kiryu: Yumi!

Yumi/Mizuki: You wouldn‚Äôt dare shoot me now. If this explodes, the 10 billion in the bar will go up in smoke.

Kiryu: (offscreen) Thanks to Yumi‚Äôs selfless act of bravery‚Ä¶ And the ideals Kazama-san passed down to me‚Ä¶

Kiryu: I am‚Ä¶ the Tojo Clan‚Äôs fourth chairman‚Ä¶ Kazuma Kiryu!

Kiryu: (offscreen) We were able to take down Jingu. But when we thought things were finally finished‚Ä¶ He walked in.

Nishikiyama: Is it over? I guess now we can settle down.

Kiryu: Nishiki‚Ä¶

Kiryu: (offscreen) Over the decade, we had both changed‚Ä¶ Fighting was the only answer we had left. But then‚Ä¶ He took mine and Haruka‚Äôs lives in his hands‚Ä¶ And set us free. Kazama-san‚Ä¶ Yumi‚Ä¶ And Nishikiyama‚Ä¶. I‚Äôd lost my family‚Ä¶ and my hope for the future.

Date: Knock it off! Don‚Äôt you have something left to fight for!? Don‚Äôt you have someone precious to protect!? Don‚Äôt run away.

Kiryu: (offscreen) It was Date-san who pulled me up from that pit‚Ä¶ And Haruka. I left control of the Tojo Clan to Terada, a man who shared Kazama-san‚Äôs ideals. And said farewell to the Tojo Clan life. Instead‚Ä¶ I chose to start anew with Haruka.

[Two cars are approaching the cemetery. There‚Äôs a familiar face in one of them.]

[YUKIO TERADA. Fifth Chairman of the Tojo Clan.]

Terada: (to his men) I‚Äôm goin‚Äô in alone.

Bodyguard: But, sir! That leaves you open to a Kansai ambush‚Ä¶

Terada: This is hallowed ground for souls at rest. They wouldn‚Äôt be so crass as to stain this place with more death.

Bodyguard: But, Captain Kashiwagi ordered us to stay close, sir.

Terada: I‚Äôm goin‚Äô alone! This conversation‚Äôs a private matter.

Bodyguard: Boys, have your steel ready all the same.

Terada‚Äôs Men: Yes, sir!

[They take out the short blades. Meanwhile, Kiryu and Haruka are praying at the graves. Haruka at the grave of her mother, Yumi, and Kiryu at the grave of his foster father, Kazama.]

Haruka: Mom‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve learned to shop and cook for myself now. Living with Uncle Kiryu has been fun, so don‚Äôt worry!

Kiryu: Pops‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm the only one still alive‚Ä¶ But now that I‚Äôm finally a real civilian‚Ä¶ I plan on bringing Haruka up right.

Terada: Fourth Chairman.

Kiryu: Terada‚Ä¶?

Terada: It‚Äôs been a while.

Kiryu: You shouldn‚Äôt be out alone.

Terada: I got the boys waiting down yonder. I‚Äôve got something I need to say that‚Äôs only for the fourth chairman‚Äôs ears‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Lose the "Fourth Chairman." I‚Äôm just a civilian now. Anyway, what‚Äôs this about?

Terada: I‚Äôm hoping to swear an oath with Chairman Goda of the Omi Alliance.

Kiryu: An oath?

Terada: If we‚Äôre going to avoid a war with the Omi Alliance, this is the only way.

Kiryu: Are things that grim for the Tojo Clan now?

Terada: The Tojo infrastructure‚Äôs still in shambles after what happened last year. If it comes to war, blood will spill, and the Tojo Clan will be devoured by the Omi Alliance. I can‚Äôt allow that to come to fruition.

Kiryu: Chairman Goda has all the leverage here. Hard to imagine them coming to the table.

Terada: I know that a dozen times over, but‚Äî

Kiryu: Terada. You‚Äôre the fifth chairman of the Tojo Clan. I‚Äôm retired. It‚Äôs not my place to interfere.

Terada: Ex-chairman, how do I navigate the Tojo Clan through this crisis? I just need guidance, please. (bows) Please‚Ä¶

[Kiryu plunges into reflections. At that moment someone shots Terada in his arm. Several thugs go out to them.]

Kiryu: What are you doing here?

Thug: We‚Äôre here for Terada-han‚Äôs head!

Kiryu: So the Omi sent hitmen from Kansai.

[They throw short blades and pistols of Terada bodyguards at Kiryu‚Äôs feet.]

Thug: Tojo Clan bodyguards don‚Äôt put up much of a fight.

Terada: What‚Äôd you do to my men!?

Thug: Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll dig ‚Äôem some holes.

Terada: What have you done!?

Thug: We‚Äôre in a graveyard. Aren‚Äôt ya glad we saved ya the trip?

Kiryu: Take Haruka and get out of here.

Terada: But‚Ä¶

Kiryu: The future of the Tajo Clan rests with you!

[Terada runs away.]

Kiryu: These guys can deal with me instead. I‚Äôll teach you what respect among yakuza means!

[And Kiryu shows what he got! Terada, meanwhile, didn‚Äôt run away anywhere, but stands behind a small fence‚Ä¶]

Kiryu: You okay!?

Terada: It‚Äôs nothing‚Ä¶

[Suddenly, the last thug with a gun runs out. Kiryu abruptly lifts his weapon from the ground and prepares to shoot, but the thug fires first. Terada covers Kiryu from the bullet.]

Kiryu: Terada!

Terada: Take this‚Ä¶

[He gives Kiryu a letter stained with blood.]

Terada: Take it to the Omi‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Chairman Goda‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Hey‚Ä¶

Terada: We are cut from different cloth, Kiryu-san. Perhaps this is what‚Äôs best for the Tojo Clan. Please‚Ä¶ Do this‚Ä¶ (passes out)

Kiryu: Terada!

[Next scene. Terada is taken to the hospital by ambulance.]

Kiryu: Terada‚Ä¶ Terada!

Haruka: Terada-san‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Stay with me, Terada!

Haruka: Terada-san‚Ä¶!

[Terada‚Äôs vitals flattens.]

Doctor: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry. The autopsy will be more specific, but I‚Äôll put cause of death as blood loss.

[Kiryu looks at the letter.]

Haruka: I can‚Ä¶ stay at Sunflower for a while. You‚Äôve got a job to do now, don‚Äôt you? Once it‚Äôs over‚Ä¶ Come back for me, okay?

[Kiryu looks at the letter. The changes to the Tojo clan meeting. The clan chairwoman, reads Terada‚Äôs will.]

Chairwoman: I, the Tojo Clan‚Äôs fifth chairman, Yukio Terada, hereby request‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶An oath of brotherhood with Chairman Jin Goda of the Omi Alliance‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶In sincerest hopes that it may put an end to the long-standing strife between us.

[YAYOI DOJIMA. Acting Chairwoman of the Tojo Clan.]

[A man gets up in the chair and starts to address the acting chairman in a rather rude manner.]

Man: You‚Äôre not seriously considering taking this letter to Kansai, are you? Acting Chairman!

Kashiwagi: Calm down!

Man: You can‚Äôt just go up to the guys who whacked your boss and ask if they wanna be friends! It‚Äôd make a helluva story, though!

Kashiwagi: So you‚Äôd have us avenge the fifth chairman‚Äôs death?

Man: Kill our kin, we kill yours. That‚Äôs the yakuza way!

Man 2: Brother‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not taking the heat if you go and do something stupid.

Man: You‚Äôd just bend over then!?

Man 2: Financing a war isn‚Äôt cheap, you know.

Man: Money, money, money! You call yourselves yakuza!?

Yayoi: Enough! (to Kiryu) So you‚Äôre going to Kansai, yes?

Kiryu: I promised the fifth chairman. Ma‚Äôam‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôd allow it‚Ä¶ Will you leave this task to me?

Kashiwagi: Kiryu‚Ä¶

Yayoi: You want to avoid all-out war too, then?

Kiryu: I do.

Kashiwagi: I can‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôll agree to this‚Ä¶

Kiryu: I‚Äôm well aware. Still‚Ä¶ This was Terada‚Äôs last request.

Yayoi: Slip up, and you‚Äôre dead.

Kiryu: I know. I‚Äôm prepared for that.

Yayoi: You wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Are you looking to trade Chairman Goda‚Äôs life for your own?

Kiryu: That all depends on his response.

Yayoi: You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ Are you still trying to atone for Dojima‚Äôs murder 11 years ago? Was that not Nishikiyama‚Äôs doing? It isn‚Äôt your responsibility to bear.

Kiryu: Nishiki and I‚Ä¶ We‚Äôd been together since we were kids. We were closer than blood brothers. Any debts Nishiki left are mine to pay now.

Yayoi: Even if I said no‚Ä¶ You‚Äôd go?

Kiryu: (bows) I‚Äôm sorry.

Yayoi: Very well. It‚Äôs in your hands, then.

Man: Wait a sec!

Man 2: Lady Chairman‚Ä¶ are you sure!? The Omi will never accept!

Man: Think this through!

[Yayoi unsheath a katana in a swift move.]

Yayoi: Kiryu plans to risk his life for the Tojo Clan. Any who object‚Ä¶ Step forward now! If this oath fails, there‚Äôs no going back! It will mean war between east and west! Knowing that, will you go?

Kiryu: Yes. But I do have one request.

Yayoi: Let‚Äôs hear it.

Kiryu: Before I leave for Kansai, there‚Äôs someone I need to see.

Yayoi: And that is?

Kiryu: Daigo Dojima. Patriarch Dojima‚Äôs son. Your son.

Yayoi: Why, though?

Kiryu: With Terada gone, the Tojo Clan lost a pillar. He‚Äôs the only one who can rebuild the clan. There‚Äôs no one else I can imagine. He‚Äôs not the sort of man who would cave to violence or authority. Right now the Tojo Clan needs a man like him.

Yayoi: Shall I take this as your dying wish?

Kiryu: If that‚Äôs how you‚Äôd prefer to see it‚Ä¶

Yayoi: You‚Äôre‚Ä¶

Kiryu: That‚Äôs why I need to speak with Daigo before heading down to Kansai.

Yayoi: I wouldn‚Äôt if I were you.

Kiryu: Why not?

Yayoi: Daigo‚Äôs not the boy he used to be.

Kiryu: Did something happen?

[Next scene. Kiryu walks through the streets of Kamurocho. The words of the acting chairwoman of the Tojo clan resound in his head.]

Yayoi: You heard that Daigo did time, right?

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ Five years ago, wasn‚Äôt it?

Yayoi: You were still in prison at the time. Thinking you‚Äôd killed his father. Daigo worked himself into a frenzy. Then he did something stupid‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Stupid?

Yayoi: He made a move on Kansai. ‚Ä¶And got busted for it. He did his time, and now he‚Äôs back in Kamurocho. He drinks like a fish these days‚Ä¶ And parties like the drunken fool he is. He‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ A puppet who cut free of his strings. Well, you‚Äôll see for yourself.

Kiryu: (Daigo Dojima‚Ä¶ Well, let‚Äôs see what I can find out.)

Find Daigo Dojima
[Kiryu walks through the busy streets of Kamurocho and notices some scumbags bullying some guy.]

Kiryu: Is there a problem here?

Handa: H-Help me, please!   

Thug: Huh? Who the hell are you? Mind your own business and piss off. And keep your mouth shut, Handa! Or are you tryin‚Äô to die!?

Handa: Urk‚Ä¶

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Thug: Huh? You got an attitude problem!? Maybe we‚Äôll get warmed up on you, then!

[Kiryu beats their sorry asses.]

Thug: Sonuvabitch! I‚Äôll remember this, Handa!

[Thugs run away.]

Handa: Th-Thank you so much!

Kiryu: What happened?

Handa: See, I asked this guy to settle his tab, but then his goons got up in my face‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Who? The guy with the tab, I mean.

Handa: Some yakuza punk named Daigo Dojima. He was headed toward the theater, but I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs long gone now. Oh, and thanks for saving me there. You can have this. (gives a piece of equipment)

[As Kiryu enters the square, a girl runs up to him.]

Rika: Help me!

Kiryu: What‚Äôs going on here?

Rika: This drunk came up and groped me! I told him off, but then he hit me!

Kiryu: Did he now‚Ä¶

Thug: Oh, does somebody wanna play hero today? Then I‚Äôll give ya a hero‚Äôs death!

[Kiryu punches the pervert into the ground.]

Rika: How can I ever thank you‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Who attacked you?

Rika: Daigo Dojima‚Äôs goons. Maybe you‚Äôve heard of him? He and his boys are always getting drunk and causing a scene.

Kiryu: They were Daigo‚Äôs? You know where he is?

Rika: I wouldn‚Äôt go looking for trouble, sir.

Kiryu: I can‚Äôt handle him. Where is he?

Rika: Inside Club Shine, where I work. I‚Äôll take you there.

[She leads Kiryu to the club called Shine.]

Rika: Here we are. Be careful‚Ä¶

[Kiryu enters the club and find Daigo.]

Kiryu: It‚Äôs been a while‚Ä¶ We need to talk.

Thug: Hey, who gave you permission to talk to aniki?

Kiryu: Aniki‚Ä¶.?

Thug 2: Yeah, asshole! So get lost!

Kiryu: I said I need to talk to this kid.

Thug: You calling aniki a kid now!?

Kiryu: This has nothing to do with you. You mind giving us just a minute?

Thug: Fuck that! I already told you to back the fuck up!

Kiryu: Let‚Äôs not cause a scene in here. Step outside.

[Kiryu and a dozen thugs walk out of the club. One of them tries to sneakily hit Kiryu from behind, but he trips him up and the bastard falls into a puddle.]

Kiryu: I‚Äôm surprised guys like you still hang around this town.

Thug: The fuck you mean by that!?

Kiryu: Guys who don‚Äôt know their place‚Ä¶That‚Äôs all.

Thug: Think you‚Äôre funny? I‚Äôll teach you to keep your goddamn mouth shut! Get him!

[Kiryu beats the punks up.]

Kiryu: I‚Äôve got nothing against you guys‚Ä¶ So don‚Äôt make me hurt you any more.

Thug: (pulls out a knife) Shut up!

Kiryu: If you‚Äôre gonna get flashy‚Ä¶ "Sorry" isn‚Äôt going to cut it.

Daigo: That‚Äôs enough.

Thug: Aniki‚Ä¶

Daigo: He‚Äôs way out of your league.

Thug: Yeah, but he‚Ä¶!

Daigo: Go back inside. Do as I say!

Thug: Yes, sir‚Ä¶

[The thugs run away.]

Daigo: They‚Äôre not very disciplined. They‚Äôve never sworn up. They just started calling me "aniki" and following me around.

Kiryu: Your charisma always drew people to you.

Daigo: Well I‚Äôm done with people all the same.

Kiryu: Please, come back to the Tojo Clan. They need you.

Daigo: Yeah, well I don‚Äôt need them. Just leave me alone.

Kiryu: Your mother told me what happened.

Daigo: Did she? All the more reason to leave me alone.

Kiryu: I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt. The whole clan‚Äôs at stake.

Daigo: I don‚Äôt care what happens to the clan.

Kiryu: You owe them a lot, Daigo. You‚Äôre only who you are today‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Because of them. Because of your father, Patriarch Dojima.

Daigo: What gives you the right to say that? Look, Kiryu-san. You were the only guy I could trust. You were my fucking hero. But not anymore. After dad died, the clan started falling apart at the seams. And now‚Ä¶? It‚Äôs not even worth risking my ass to save.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre pretty sharp.

Daigo: Huh?

Kiryu: You‚Äôre exactly right‚Ä¶ As it stands, the Tojo Clan isn‚Äôt worth dying for. The officers are busy counting their money, and any power they had is gone. But still‚Ä¶ For my part‚Ä¶ I have faith.

Daigo: In what?

Kiryu: Guys like Kazama-san and Shimano‚Ä¶ And‚Ä¶ How strong the clan was under them and your father. If the Tojo Clan‚Äôs going to make a comeback‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs going to need you.

Daigo: Oh, that‚Äôs rich coming from you‚Ä¶ Aren‚Äôt you the one who fucked it all up last year!?

Kiryu: Yeah. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm back‚Ä¶ To take responsibility for it!

[He punches Daigo.]

Daigo: What the fuck, man‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Well? Are you waking up yet?

Daigo: You never change‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve always tried to punch your problems.

Kiryu: That‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôve ever known‚Ä¶

Daigo: I‚Äôm the same way. If something‚Äôs charging me‚Ä¶ I charge right at it!

[He fights Kiryu and loses. Kiryu hands him Terada‚Äôs will.]

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan‚Äôs entire future rests on this.

[Some time passes. Daigo reads the will.]

Kiryu: I‚Äôm going to Kansai tomorrow. I might not make it back alive. That‚Äôs why I need you to hold down the fort‚Ä¶

Daigo: Fuck that. I‚Äôm not letting you go play hero alone.

Kiryu: But the Tojo Clan‚Ä¶ Please.

Daigo: No way. I‚Äôm coming with.

Kiryu: What?

Daigo: Look, I‚Äôve got a score to settle in Kansai.

Kiryu: What score?

Daigo: Five years ago, they set me up. And ever since, my life‚Äôs been shit. I‚Äôm not going back to yakuza life until I‚Äôve settled accounts.

Kiryu: Daigo‚Ä¶

Daigo: Doesn‚Äôt matter what you say. I don‚Äôt even care if you stay or go. I‚Äôm going.

[He hands over the will to Kiryu.]

Kiryu: Hey‚Ä¶

Daigo: I‚Äôll be waiting at the station tomorrow. See you there.

Chapter 2: THE DRAGON OF KANSAI
[Night. Kiryu and Daigo take the high-speed train to Kansai.]

Kiryu: Hey‚Ä¶ Your fight five years ago‚Ä¶ Who‚Äôd you face?

Daigo: The second patriarch of the Omi Alliance‚Äôs Go-Ryu Clan, Ryuji Goda. He‚Äôs the son of the chairman we‚Äôre heading to meet, Jin Goda.

Kiryu: The chairman‚Äôs son‚Ä¶

Daigo: I was an idiot‚Ä¶ I fell right into his little trap.

Kiryu: A trap?

Daigo: Yeah‚Ä¶ Five years ago, the Go-Ryu Clan was making regular visits up to Kamurocho.

Kiryu: Were they after the old Dojima Family?

Daigo: It didn‚Äôt matter. Any Tojo officer would do. Their plan was to poke at the Tojo until they came down to Kansai. I was pretty reckless back then, and I jumped at the bait.

Kiryu: You made a move on Kansai?

Daigo: All by myself. I flew out to Kansai for a one-on-one fight with Ryuji Goda. But when I got there, the cops were waiting. Got busted for carrying, and then it was shit jail food for five years. Not that I can complain to a guy who ate it for twice that. So I still owe one to Ryuji Goda. Until I settle this, I can‚Äôt carry the Tojo Clan‚Ä¶

Kiryu: I see‚Ä¶

Daigo: The Omi Alliance doesn‚Äôt fuck around. Who knows what they‚Äôve got up their sleeve? This oath thing‚Ä¶ You better be careful.

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶

[They arrive in Sotenbori.]

Daigo: Yo, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: Yeah?

Daigo: You headed straight to the hotel?

Kiryu: I haven‚Äôt given it much thought.

Daigo: Yeah, well‚Ä¶ Like I said, I‚Äôve got nothing but bad memories here. Doesn‚Äôt exactly put me in the mood to hit the town.

Kiryu: I think I‚Äôll go for a walk, then. You get some rest.

Daigo: Right, maybe I‚Äôll do just that. Stay on your toes, though. This isn‚Äôt Kamurocho.


Kiryu: Same to you. Don‚Äôt overdo it if you hit the bars. Later.

[Daigo leaves.]

Sotenbori Thug: Hey! Where do ya think you‚Äôre goin‚Äô, pal? I ain‚Äôt seen you around before! Guy like you should know yer place. Quit struttin‚Äô around like a damn peacock.

Yeah, uh‚Ä¶ my bad?
I peacocked your mom. +

Sotenbori Thug: Oh, a wise guy! I‚Äôll sink your smart ass in the river! Hope ya believe in an afterlife, buddy!

[Kiryu shows the thug his place‚Ä¶ on the ground.]

Sotenbori Thug: Damn! Sorry I called ya a peacock! Maybe somethin‚Äô got lost in translation‚Ä¶

[He runs away. A man in a purple suit shouts to Kiryu.]

Kurokawa: Hey, just a sec! Hold on now, I ain‚Äôt no trouble, buddy! Whew‚Ä¶ Did ya think I was yakuza, buddy? Can‚Äôt say I blame ya. what with my mean mug. Runs in the family. Mama‚Äôs side, y‚Äôknow? I tell folks I ain‚Äôt yakuza, and they still run off screamin‚Äô bloody murder‚Ä¶ For real, how‚Äôs an honest man s‚Äôposed to do business in this damn town? At this rate, I may as well join a yakuza clan! Would serve ‚Äòem right! ‚Ä¶Annnnywho, I just saw ya drop that blowhard. You‚Äôre a real bruiser, eh? Numbskull there was givin‚Äô me shit, too. Oh, I‚Äôm Kurokawa by the way. It means "black river," but my heart‚Äôs white as snow and pure as a pretty lady. Speakin‚Äô of pretty ladies, boy, mine sure wasn‚Äôt. Had a face like a porkchop. Almost glad she ran off, y‚Äôknow? ‚Ä¶Annnnnywho, what‚Äôs yer name, fella?

Kiryu: It‚Äôs Kiryu.

Kurokawa: Kiryu-han, eh? First time in Osaka? Glad to have ya either way. ‚Ä¶Annnnnywho, I owe ya one for dunkin‚Äô that dipstick. But what to give ya? Hmmmm‚Ä¶ Anything you‚Äôre after, buddy? Tell ya what, I got dirt on this whole city. Ya need info, you just scooch on up for a scoop. I‚Äôll be around if ya need me, buddy!

[Kiryu explores the city. It‚Äôs been ages since he has been there. He eats in a restaurant and visits popular local cabaret called Grand.]

Customer: Man, this is bullshit! I was upstairs enjoyin‚Äô the VIP seats when a pack of yakuza-lookin‚Äô heavies busted in‚Ä¶ Then I get bounced down here!? I was on the waiting list for three months to get those seats!

Staff: I‚Äôm terribly sorry, sir. How can we make this up for you?

[There‚Äôs something fishy is going on there. Kiryu goes to talk about it with Kurokawa.]

Kiryu: What can you tell me about the VIP seats at the Cabaret Grand?

Kurokawa: The Cabaret Grand? You mean the pride of Sotenbori down there? Did‚Äôya know Maki Kuraishi got her start there? She‚Äôs a movie star now! I knew a man like you would have great taste, Kiryu-han. Annnnywho, I got this guy who takes care of butt beads. Hemorrhoids, I mean. Well, that guy‚Äôs nephew‚Äôs teacher‚Äôs sister‚Äôs hubby gots this twin brother who plays mahjong with the Grand‚Äôs owner. Tell ya what. I owe ya one, so I‚Äôll put in a call to my butt guy‚Ä¶ He‚Äôll talk to his nephew‚Äôs teacher‚Äôs sister‚Äôs hubby‚Äôs twin brother‚Äôs mahjong friend‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôll get ya up in those VIP seats. Just uh, gimme a few‚Ä¶ (calling) Yello? Yeah, hey bud. How‚Äôs the butt clinic? Ya know that guy at the Grand who plays mahjong with your nephew‚Äôs teacher‚Äôs sis‚Äôs hubby‚Äôs twin bro? Yeah, I need ya to call in a fav - Eh? Whaddaya mean, ‚Äúwho is this!?‚Äù It‚Äôs Kurokawa, ya blowhard! I said it‚Äôs Kurokawa! Get your damn ears checked! Anyway, I need VIP seats at the Grand for a good buddy o‚Äômine. Whaddaya mean it‚Äôs full up with real VIPs!? Ya tryin‚Äô to piss me off!? Look pal, I got pics of you balls deep in some chick who ain‚Äôt exactly your wife, hear? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs room for one more narrow ass in those VIP seats! Oh, ya think that‚Äôs funny? How funny is it gonna be if my finger slips and hits "send" right now? ‚Ä¶Right, right. I knew ya‚Äôd see it my way. My boy‚Äôs name is Kiryu. Mighty generous of ya, friend. (hangs up) Kiryu-han, there‚Äôs your VIP seats at the Cabaret Grand all sorted. Apparently, they‚Äôre pretty hard to get. Invitation only, yeah? Anyhow, shame I can‚Äôt do more for ya. Knock ‚Äôem dead tonight, buddy!

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

[He goes back to Grand.]

Kiryu: Hi. I‚Äôm supposed to be on a list, courtesy of Kurokawa.

VIP Employee: You must be Kiryu-sama, then? I do have your name, sir. Is this your first visit to the VIP section, sir? Please make your way right up these stairs.

Yuko: Welcome! I‚Äôm Yuko. A pleasure to have ya, sir!

[While beautiful girls in red dresses dance on the first floor stage, on the VIP second floor the businessmen and other wealthy residents discuss business and have fun. Kiryu smokes a cigarette and chats with a hostess named Yuko.]

Yuko: Not from around here, are ya, sir?

Kiryu: Right.

Yuko: Here on vacation?

Kiryu: Not really‚Ä¶

Yuko: Oh, business, then?

Kiryu: Well, that‚Äôs not far off‚Ä¶

Rude Customer: Hey! Let‚Äôs get more ladies over here! Where‚Äôs the fuckin‚Äô manager!?

Yuko: Careful! Don‚Äôt make eye contact with ‚Äôem. He‚Äôs a bigshot yakuza in these parts.

Scared Waiter: Y-Yes, sir? Can I help you?

Yakuza: No other joint in Kansai would leave our table this empty!

Scared Waiter: (bows) I-I‚Äôm terribly sorry!

Yakuza 2: Quit bowin‚Äô like a goddamn chicken‚Ä¶ And get your finest bitches over at our table!

Yakuza Boss: Watch yer fuckin‚Äô mouth. Move along.

Yakuza: B-Boss! Thank you very much!

Hostess: You‚Äôre amazing, boss! Spoken like a king!

Yakuza 3: You‚Äôre damn right! Don‚Äôt tell me a gal in your line of work doesn‚Äôt know this guy‚Ä¶ Future chairman of the Omi Alliance‚Ä¶ The Dragon of Kansai. Remember that!

Hostess: Wow!

[Yakuza Boss still looks menacingly tense.]

Yakuza 3: S-Something wrong? What, is it her?

Yakuza 2: Not quite‚Ä¶ Ya wanna repeat that?

Yakuza 3: Huh?

Yakuza 2: Drawin‚Äô a blank already?

Yakuza Boss: Take a walk, will ya ladies?

Yakuza 3: U-Uh‚Ä¶ Did I..?

Yakuza 2: What‚Äôs the one thing the boss don‚Äôt ever wanna hear?

Yakuza 3: Oh, uh‚Ä¶

Yakuza 2: Ya gonna hurry the fuck up and apologize!?

Yakuza 3: (bows to the ground) I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm real sorry!

Yakuza Boss: Look at ya. Pathetic. Get yer ass back on the chair.

[He picks up a bottle of alcohol and takes a few big sips. Then he offers his drink to Yakuza 3, who is shaking with fear.]

Yakuza Boss: Yamada‚Ä¶ How long ya been runnin‚Äô with me now?

Yamada: T-Two years‚Ä¶

Yakuza Boss: I see.

[He keeps pouring alcohol into the glass even though the glass has long been full.]

Yamada: Uhh‚Ä¶ Boss?

Yakuza Boss: So, remembered what ya said yet?

Yamada: Um, I, uh‚Ä¶

Yakuza Boss: C‚Äômon, drink up.

Yamada: O-Oh, uh‚Ä¶ Thank you.

[He drinks alcohol, while the Boss hits him over the head with an empty bottle, grabs him by the collar and treats him with the neck of the bottle left in his hands.]

Yakuza Boss: That jog yer memory!? I want ya to repeat that shit!

[A calm voice comes from afar.]

Kiryu: The Dragon of Kansai. He called you the Dragon of Kansai.

Yuko: H-Hey, are ya nuts!?

Kiryu: Kinda tough to relax in here.

[He walks up to the Yakuza table.]

Yakuza: Hold it! Ya got balls sayin‚Äô that shit!

Kiryu: He said he wanted to hear it repeated.

Yakuza 4: Ya got an eavesdroppin‚Äô problem, too!?

[Kiryu is surrounded.]

Kiryu: As loud as you were shouting, it‚Äôs not like I had much choice.

[Yakuza 4 hits Kiryu over the head with a bottle, but Kiryu doesn‚Äôt even blink. A confused Yakuza 4 tries to attack Kiryu with the neck of his bottle, but Kiryu throws him off the side of the floor onto the piano.]

Yakuza: We‚Äôve got a tough guy, eh!? Want me to sink yer ass in Osaka Bay!? Get ready to die!

[Kiryu defeats the Omi yakuzas.]

Yakuza Boss: (clapping) Pretty good! I owe ya an apology. My boys can get trigger happy.

[Kiryu walks away.]

Yakuza Boss: Leaving so soon?

Kiryu: Guys like you make for sour drinks.

Yakuza Boss: (laughs) You‚Äôre a real piece o‚Äô work! I like ya! At least lemme buy a round for yer trouble.

Kiryu: I‚Äôll pass.

Yakuza Boss: The Omi‚Äôs Go-Ryu Clan is offering ya a drink. C‚Äômon, spare me the shame of it all.

Kiryu: Go-Ryu Clan‚Ä¶

Yakuza Boss: Alright! Gimme the priciest bottle in the house! Let‚Äôs go!

Yakuza: Yes, sir!

Yakuza Boss: You‚Äôre a real ballbuster, pal. My clan ain‚Äôt got any guys like you. Ya from Kanto, friend?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Yakuza Boss: Figured as much. If a guy like you was a Kansai man, I‚Äôda heard the rumors by now. And now that we‚Äôre through the pleasantries, how‚Äôs about yer name?
[Kiryu stays silent.]

Yakuza Boss: How rude o‚Äô me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm the second patriarch of the Omi Alliance‚Äôs Go-Ryu Clan‚Ä¶ Name‚Äôs Ryuji Goda.

[RYUJI GODA. Patriarch of the Go-Ryu Clan, an Omi Alliance subsidiary.]

Kiryu: Goda‚Ä¶

[He sits on a couch.]

Ryuji: Surely ya‚Äôve heard of the Omi Alliance? It‚Äôs practically the most recognizable sigil in Japan‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yeah.

Ryuji: Now‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs yer name?

Kiryu: I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm anyone special.

Ryuji: I‚Äôve laid my cards out on the table here. Least a guy can do is tell me his name.

Kiryu: Kiryu‚Ä¶ Kazuma Kiryu.

Ryuji: The Dragon of Dojima. The Tojo Clan‚Äôs Kazuma Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: No. That‚Äôs not who I am.

Ryuji: (laughs) Ya had me goin‚Äô for a sec‚Ä¶! Don‚Äôt go scarin‚Äô me like that! Not that you could be him anyway. If ya were, no way you‚Äôd be sittin‚Äô here sippin‚Äô drinks right now.

Kiryu: And why‚Äôs that?

Ryuji: ‚ÄòCause you‚Äôd have yer hands full already. You‚Äôd be gettin‚Äô ready for war, fast as ya could. Aw, screw it! Might as well fill ya in. Ya know why I lost my cool back there?

Kiryu: Why?

Ryuji: I hate bein‚Äô called the Dragon of Kansai. Dragon, I don‚Äôt mind. But the Kansai part pisses me off. A dragon don‚Äôt know Kansai or Dojima. We only need one dragon in our world. Ain‚Äôt room for more. Wouldn‚Äôt ya say?

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶Maybe so.

Ryuji: (laughs) Guess we see eye to eye. Must be fate, eh? While I‚Äôm on a roll, here‚Äôs another hot tip. At midnight tonight‚Ä¶ Kamurocho‚Äôs gonna see the biggest damn fireworks show ever.

Kiryu: Fireworks?

Ryuji: Just a little show I‚Äôm puttin‚Äô on. The festival of a lifetime‚Äôs set to start, my friend.

Kiryu: A festival?

Ryuji: And the fireworks over Kamurocho are just the opening ceremony. Because then, tomorrow‚Ä¶ The Dragon of Dojima‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Dies.

Kiryu: What?

Ryuji: And I become the one true dragon. ‚Ä¶But I‚Äôve talked yer ear off. Kick back and relax, Kiryu-san. Enjoy yer evening. Oh right‚Ä¶ One more thing. If ya decide to join us‚Ä¶ Wear some damn cologne or somethin‚Äô.

Kiryu: What‚Äôs that supposed to mean?

Ryuji: I could smell ya the moment ya walked in. You reek of blood. Kazuma Kiryu-san.. ‚Ä¶Later.

[He and his crew leave.]

Kiryu: (to himself) Fireworks? At midnight‚Ä¶? What the hell is he planning?

[Kiryu looks at his watch. It‚Äôs already midnight. He leaves the cabaret and overhead two men speaking.]

Concerned Man: You hear about the explosion?

Excitable Man: They‚Äôre runnin‚Äô the news on that big outdoor screen!

Kiryu: (Something‚Äôs wrong‚Ä¶ I need to figure out what.)

[Kiryu lunges into the square. Meanwhile a deafening explosion on the top floor of a huge tower in the center of Kamurocho. He sees a news report on the screen that reads „Éü„É¨„Éã„Ç¢„É†„Çø„ÉØ„ÉºÁàÜÁô∫‰∫ãÊïÖ?! (Millennium Tower explosion!?).]

News Reporter: Moments ago at midnight, a violent explosion shook Kamurocho‚Äôs Millennium Tower. Details have yet to be confirmed, but reports suggest the source of explosion‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶was the offices of a suspected-criminal organization, and that it may not be accidental.

Kiryu: This is it‚Ä¶ The fireworks‚Ä¶

[Meanwhile, many police cars and medics arrive in the square. A detective from the beginning of the game walks into camera view.]

Detective: So it‚Äôs begun‚Ä¶

[He leaves the square. In the next scene we move to Ë≠¶Ë¶ñÂ∫ÅÁ•ûÂÆ§Ë≠¶ÂØüÁΩ≤ Kamuro District Police Station. /a little clarification for those who don‚Äôt know Japanese - the prefix ‚Äúcho‚Äù means "district" just as in shiba inu ‚Äúinu‚Äù just means ‚Äúa dog‚Äù/ Junichi Sudo speaking on the phone.]

Junichi Sudo: Yes. Sudo speaking. Yes, I‚Äôm afraid so‚Ä¶ Just as you predicted, Chief Kurahashi.

[JUNICHI SUDO. Metropolitan Police Division Four: Organized Crime.]

Sudo: No, there‚Äôs no link to Kansai yet. Yes, that‚Äôs correct. I have my suspicions about foreign syndicate involvement as well. I see. Understood. I‚Äôll make the arrangements. Yes. Date-san‚Äôs the only one capable of that. Right‚Ä¶ Goodbye.

Chapter 3: THE YAKUZA HUNTRESS
[Kiryu meets with Daigo.]

Daigo: Hell of a night, huh?

Kiryu: In more ways than one‚Ä¶

Daigo: You mean something besides a bombing back home?

Kiryu: Just a little run-in I had in town.

Daigo: Hm?

Kiryu: Nothing you need to worry about. But you should probably call to check in on Kashiwagi-san when you can.

Daigo: Yeah, I will. Just let me know when you‚Äôre ready to head for Omi HQ.

Kiryu: All right.

Daigo: Ready to go?

Actually, just a second.
I‚Äôm all set. +

Kiryu: Yeah, I‚Äôm all set.

Daigo: All right. There‚Äôs no turning back now.

Kiryu: Yeah. This is it.

Daigo: Let‚Äôs roll, then.

Elsewhere in Sotenbori‚Ä¶

[We enter the office of some Yakuza Boss.]

[For those who are curious about what is written on the board, I will assume that it is ‰ªª‰æ† ‚Äúchivalry, generosity‚Äù. As for Â∞§ÁâåÁîü I will assume that it is a Chinese manufacturer of such boards, which is pronounced, apparently, Yubaisheng. Also, I will cautiously assume that it must be some kind of joke or irony that you won‚Äôt find chivalry or generosity in this room.]

Yakuza Boss: Detective‚Ä¶ I would never threaten a civilian! Surely this is some kinda mix-up?

Woman Detective: When ya met with the president of Kojima Realty at that caf√©‚Ä¶ Were ya not poundin‚Äô on the table?

[KAORU SAYAMA. Osaka Prefectural Police Detective Division Four: Organized Crime.]

Yakuza Boss: I‚Äôd hardly call it a poundin‚Äô. More of a little‚Ä¶ More of a line. Tap! (softly hits his table) That‚Äôs all it was.

Kaoru: Sounds like extortion to me.

Yakuza Boss: You‚Äôre kiddin‚Äô, right!? Pinch us on trumped up charges like that and we won‚Äôt be able to keep food on the table!

Kaoru: Shoulda thought of that before ya started droppin‚Äô your second-string family‚Äôs name to scare civilians.

Yakuza Boss: (gets up from his chair) Second-string family!? And here I was keepin‚Äô this civil on account of you bein‚Äô a chick!

Kaoru: Keep your goddamn chivalry!

[She smashes the glass on the board that says ‰ªª‰æ† with her wooden sword.]

Yakuza Boss: What the fuck, lady!?

Kaoru: Real yakuza hustle to score big, not to scare up chump change! Book him. Extortion, assault, tax evasion‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll get the whole sorry story at the station.

[Two policemen seize the yakuza boss.]

Yakuza Boss: Get your hands offa me, asshole!

[He pouches one of the policemen.]

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶And now resistin‚Äô arrest for the cherry on top.

[Next scene. Police Station.]

Police Chief: The Omi Alliance and the Tojo Clan strikin‚Äô up an accord!?

Man on the Phone: That‚Äôs what our intel says.

Police Chief: What, then, would the mighty Tokyo PD have us do exactly?

Man on the Phone: Take Kazuma Kiryu into custody, please.

Police Chief: Huh?

Man on the Phone: If the peace talks fail, and Kiryu gets killed, there‚Äôll be no stopping the bloodshed.

Police Chief: So what yer sayin‚Äô is ya want the cops to babysit a yakuza?

[Kaoru overhears the conversation.]

Police Chief: Yes, pretty much. Time is short, so we‚Äôre counting on you here. (hungs up)

[TSUTOMU BESSHO. Osaka Prefectural Police Chief Division Four: Organized Crime.]

Tsutomu: They think they run the fuckin‚Äô show!

Kaoru: Chief‚Ä¶ What was that all about?

Tsutomu: Eh? Yeah, that was Tokyo‚Äôs Division Four.

Kaoru: What‚Äôd ya mean, "babysit a yakuza"?

Tsutomu: Seems Kazuma Kiryu hotfooted into Kansai.

Kaoru: Kiryu‚Ä¶ Ya mean‚Ä¶

Tsutomu: Yep, that one. Tojo Clan fourth chairman. If he bites it in our backyard, it‚Äôll be an east versus west shitstorm. So they‚Äôre askin‚Äô us to play bodyguard. What a fuckin‚Äô mess‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Fine‚Ä¶ Put me on it, then.

Tsutomu: Oh hell no. When I need a sitter, you ain‚Äôt exactly who I‚Äôd call.

Kaoru: Ain‚Äôt this our big chance?

Tsutomu: Chance how?

Kaoru: We take responsibility for Kazuma Kiryu‚Ä¶ And with him in protective custody he‚Äôs our ticket to investigate in Kanto, yeah?

Tsutomu: What, you‚Äôre gonna bust into Kanto and show ‚Äôem how it‚Äôs done in Osaka? Wipe off those smug-ass Tokyo grins?

Kaoru: Dependin‚Äô where it leads, we could deploy the whole force.

Tsutomu: Yeah, that‚Äôd be a hoot‚Ä¶ "Osakan police invade Kanto! Film at 11."

Kaoru: So I got the job?

Tsutomu: Hey, now just a minute! You ain‚Äôt still hung-up on the Tojo Clan, are ya?

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶No, sir! I‚Äôm askin‚Äô as lead detective of Osaka PD Division Four here.

Tsutomu: Swear on it?

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶Yeah.

Tsutomu: Alright. You‚Äôre off the leash!

Kaoru: Got it!

[Next scene. Kiryu approaches the Omi Alliance gate, decorated with their symbol ËøëÊ±ü.]

Daigo: So that explosion‚Ä¶ Blew the Kazama Family office to shit. Patriarch Kashiwagi‚Äôs all right, though.

Kiryu: That‚Äôs good‚Ä¶

Daigo: Don‚Äôt suppose it was the Omi, do you?

Kiryu: Most likely Ryuji Goda.

Daigo: Huh?

Kiryu: Yeah, I met him last night in Sotenbori.

Daigo: You did?

[The gate opens. Behind them we see a lot of people lined up in two rows. One of them brings in the arriving yakuza.]

Omi Yakuza: We‚Äôve been expectin‚Äô you.

Kiryu: Let‚Äôs go.

Daigo: Y-Yeah‚Ä¶

Omi Yakuzas: Welcome!

Daigo: They should be on the top floor. Let‚Äôs head up.

Go to the Omi Alliance HQ top floor
Kiryu: (The interior‚Äôs layout is pretty complex. Maybe it‚Äôs meant to slow down intruders?)

Omi Alliance Member: Straight into the back, sir.

[Kiryu and Daigo enter a large dojo-like hall. They sit on the floor on special cushions. There are several people sitting across from them. After a few minutes more people enter, one of whom is carrying an old yakuza with a long white beard in a wheelchair.]

Old Yakuza: You‚Äôve come quite a ways. Welcome. I am the fifth chairman of the Omi Alliance, Jin Goda. (bows)

[JIN GODA. Fifth Chairman of the Omi Alliance.]

Jin Goda: I‚Äôve heard the rumors, Fourth Chairman Kiryu.

Kiryu: I graciously accept your hospitality‚Ä¶ (bows) As the Tojo Clan‚Äôs fourth chairman, Kazuma Kiryu.

Jin Goda: Let‚Äôs dispense with the formalities, then. Allow me to introduce my officers. Beside me is chief director of Omi Headquarters, Takashima. He took over Terada‚Äôs chief of HQ position.

Takashima: (politely bows) A pleasure to meet you.

[RYO TAKASHIMA. Patriarch of the Takashima Family, an Omi Alliance subsidiary.]

Kiryu: You‚Äôre Terada‚Äôs‚Ä¶

Takashima: Yes, Terada ‚Äì No, the Tojo Clan‚Äôs fifth chairman, was my sworn brother. What happened was‚Ä¶ extremely unfortunate.

Jin Goda: Next to him‚Ä¶

Daigo: Wait a minute! Hey‚Ä¶ You wanna repeat that crap? Unfortunate? That some kinda sick joke? You assholes are the ones that killed him!

[Kiryu swiftly stops Daigo.]

Takashima: Terada‚Äôs death is on the Omi‚Äôs hands, yes‚Ä¶ However‚Ä¶ That was not the chairman‚Äôs will.

Daigo: Bullshit! You think that excuses you!?

[Some yakuza throws a fan on the floor.]

Yakuza: Quit your yappin‚Äô, junior.

Daigo: Huh?

Yakuza: Look, a meetin‚Äô like this is for folks with status.

[TORANOSUKE SENGOKU. Patriarch of the Sengoku Family, an Omi Alliance subsidiary.]

Toranosuke: Kid like you oughta let the big boys do the talkin‚Äô. Eh? Am I right, Tojo Fourth Chairman-han!?

Takashima: Enough, Sengoku. That was rude.

Kiryu: I apologize. The first offense was ours.

Jin Goda: I am truly saddened by what happened to Terada. I hope you‚Äôll accept my deepest apologies.

Toranosuke: Back it up a sec! Ain‚Äôt no need for apologies here! Terada was one o‚Äô ours to begin with. Shouldn‚Äôt matter none to you how our side deals with traitors.

Takashima: Sengoku!

Daigo: (stands up) What a goddamn farce.

Toranosuke: Ehh?

Daigo: We‚Äôre supposed to believe you‚Äôre sorry? Really, Goda-san? Only a year ago‚Ä¶ You went behind Terada‚Äôs back to ally with Jingu so you could take over the Tojo Clan. Don‚Äôt even try to deny it!

Jin Goda: It‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ However, that was neither me nor my officers‚Äô doin‚Äô.

Daigo: Really? Quit shifting all the blame!

Takashima: Kiryu-san, Dojima-san‚Ä¶ This is a difficult subject for Chairman Goda. If you‚Äôll allow me‚Ä¶ The Jingu incident last year was an independent act of the Go-Ryu Clan patriarch.

Daigo: What!?

Kiryu: Ryuji?

Takashima: So you know him‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs the chairman‚Äôs son. He failed to learn his father‚Äôs temperance. He wields the Omi sigil as he pleases‚Ä¶ I suspect that the ones who attacked Terada were also the Go-Ryu Clan.

Kiryu: Then‚Ä¶ Ryuji‚Äôs the one who ordered Terada‚Äôs death?

Takashima: Most likely.

Toranosuke: This is stupid. I‚Äôm done here.

Takashima: Sengoku!

Toranosuke: What? Handle this however ya damn please. If ya need money to cover Terada‚Äôs incense, just lemme know, yeah? l‚Äôd be happy to spot ya a bil or two. ‚Ä¶Later.

[He picks up his fan and leaves.]

Jin Goda: Kiryu-san, this is the current state of the Omi Alliance. 120 families, over 35,000 men‚Ä¶ The Alliance has grown too large. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to control.

Takashima: Fifth Chairman‚Ä¶

Jin Goda: Takashima here‚Äôs a sharp one. Terada was the same way. That said‚Ä¶ The young blood like Sengoku and Ryuji don‚Äôt much care to listen.

Kiryu: Goda-san‚Ä¶

Jin Goda: Kiryu-san, losing Terada is a heavy blow for both Tojo and Omi alike‚Ä¶ I feel that now‚Äôs the time to balance the power of east and west and uproot the seeds of conflict.

Kiryu: Balance them, sir?

Jin Goda: Exactly. Kiryu-san, I believe you‚Äôre capable of this. I want to see ya rebuild the Tojo Clan. And if the Omi can be of help along the way, then I‚Äôd gladly assist.

[Kiryu stands up and walks to Jin Goda. He politely hands over Terada‚Äôs will to him.]

Jin Goda: What‚Äôs this?

Kiryu: A letter Terada wrote. He wanted an alliance, Chairman Goda.

Jin Goda: Terada‚Ä¶

Kiryu: And the Tojo Clan echoes Terada‚Äôs wish. An oath of equal alliance. Will you accept that?

Jin Goda: I will accept.

Kiryu: Thank you. I‚Äôll send for the Tojo Clan‚Äôs acting chairman, Yayoi Dojima, to come at once.

Jin Goda: I should say not. It‚Äôs our turn to make the trip. I‚Äôll head up to Kamurocho.

Kiryu: Very well. You have our gratitude.

[Suddenly a lot of armed men burst into the room.]

Ryuji: So ya were the real Dragon of Dojima after all, Kiryu-han.

Jin Goda: Ryuji!

Ryuji: The Tojo and the Omi in a 50-50 alliance? Sure it ain‚Äôt 80-20? Shit, more like 90-10?

Jin Goda: Why‚Äôd you come here? Ya don‚Äôt belong amongst Omi officers!

[Daigo stands in Ryuji‚Äôs way.]

Ryuji: Eh? What‚Äôs up?

Daigo: Do I look familiar?

Ryuji: Nope.

Daigo: You set me up five years ago. I‚Äôm Sohei Dojima‚Äôs son, Daigo.

Ryuji: I said I don‚Äôt know ya.

Daigo: This isn‚Äôt about the oath‚Ä¶ You and I‚Ä¶ have some unfinished business!

[He tries to hit Ryuji, but Ryuji sharply stabs him in the stomach with his tanto sheath.]

Ryuji: Can‚Äôt expect me to remember every scrub. Sit down. Take a nap or somethin‚Äô.

Jin Goda: What‚Äôs this about!?

Ryuji: Do it!

[Ryuji‚Äôs men surround the patriarchs of the families and put guns to their heads.]

Jin Goda: What‚Äôre you doing!? What‚Äôs the meaning of this!?

Kiryu: You‚Ä¶ You even know where you are?

Ryuji: What kinda question is that?

Kiryu: This is Omi Alliance Headquarters!

Ryuji: Ya think I don‚Äôt know that? This here‚Äôs what I call a coup.

Kiryu: What the hell?

Ryuji: Can‚Äôt have my old man here talkin‚Äô peace with the Tojo Clan now. He finalizes an alliance, then my plans get shot to shit.

[Ryuji‚Äôs men take the patriarchs out of the room.]

Kiryu: Is that what you‚Äôre after‚Ä¶ A war?

Ryuji: Sure is. The east versus the west. That‚Äôs all I want‚Ä¶ Well, that and one more thing‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Me?

Ryuji: Damn right. Yer head on a platter. Think yer worth the hassle? I say we find out!

[Kiryu defeats Go-Ryu Clan yakuzas.]

Ryuji: (clapping) Damn, what a beast! And here I thought ya were tough last night! I prefer a challenge. More fun than takin‚Äô out chumps.

[Daigo wakes up and punches Ryuji. He falls on his ass.]

Ryuji: What the fuck are ya doin‚Äô?

Daigo: I‚Äôm not gonna let you ignore me. I told you we had unfinished business! Kiryu-san, this one‚Äôs mine. You go help Chairman Goda.

Kiryu: All right.

Ryuji: Ain‚Äôt you a spunky one? Oh well, though‚Ä¶ You wanna die so bad‚Ä¶ I‚ÄôII send your ass to hell first!

Rescue Chairman Goda
[Kiryu runs for Chairman Goda punching sorry ass yakuzas on the way. He saves him.]

Jin Goda: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ This is my son‚Äôs mess‚Ä¶ And makin‚Äô you help clean it up‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have the words‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Tojo, Omi‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt matter. Don‚Äôt trouble yourself, sir.

[A badly beaten Daigo comes out to them. He falls to the ground.]

Kiryu: Keep it together!

Daigo: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ That guy‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a real tank.

Ryuji: This ain‚Äôt even over!

Kiryu: Daigo‚Ä¶ Take Chairman Goda. Get back to the Tojo.

Daigo: I still owe this guy a‚Äî

Kiryu: Right now, getting Chairman Goda to swear the oath with the Tojo Clan is the priority! Besides‚Ä¶ We can‚Äôt afford to lose you here.

Daigo: But if I leave it like this‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Just listen to me, damn it!

Daigo: ‚Ä¶Fine

[He leaves with the chairman.]

Ryuji: Finally down to the two of us‚Ä¶

Kiryu: The chairman‚Äôs with the Tajo Clan now. I‚Äôm not letting anything stop this alliance.

Ryuji: Fine, fine‚Ä¶ One more thing to do after I kill ya, then.

Kiryu: Think you can?

Ryuji: Yeah‚Ä¶ Only room for one dragon‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs see which one of us is real!

[The fateful fight between two dragons begins!]

Ryuji: This is where ya die!

[Ryuji Goda appears to be super tough but Kiryu manages to endure the fight and wins!]

Ryuji: This ain‚Äôt over by a longshot!

Kiryu: I never could abide an unfair fight.

Ryuji: ‚ÄôScuse me?

Kiryu: You just had it out with Daigo. He‚Äôs pretty tough. You were in no condition to fight.

Ryuji: I ain‚Äôt done til one of us ain‚Äôt breathin!

[Police sirens are heard.]

Ryuji: Fuck! Don‚Äôt forget‚Ä¶ I ain‚Äôt through with you!

[He runs away.]

Kaoru: Cuff anyone who‚Äôs still here!

Policemen: Yes, ma‚Äôam!

Kaoru: Kazuma Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: That‚Äôs me.

Kaoru: Detective Kaoru Sayama, Osaka Police. You‚Äôre under arrest for assault.

[She cuffs Kiryu.]

Chapter 4: THE FOUR KINGS OF OMI
[Next scene. Police station. Date walks in a corridor and bumps into some lady carrying documents.]

Date: Oh‚Ä¶ Sorry about that.

Young Lady: Excuse me if I‚Äôm wrong, but‚Ä¶ Aren‚Äôt you Detective Date?

Date: Huh? Yeah, why?

Young Lady: Oh wow, I knew it! I‚Äôm a huge fan of yours!

Date: Fan? How the heck?

Young Lady: A year ago, you ignored orders to follow your own lead. You‚Äôre the one who busted Jingu‚Äôs money-laundering scheme! People still talk about the legendary Detective Date!

Date: Hey, hold on! I wasn‚Äôt the one who solved that case. Besides, I‚Äôm not even a detective anymore.

Young Lady: I know! After the incident, you quit the force. I heard you threw your badge at the chief then popped him one right in the face!

Date: (—Åonfused) Oh, come on with this‚Ä¶

Voice: The legendary detective‚Ä¶

Date: Hm?

[A detective from the beginning of the game appears.]

Detective: A cop buddied up with a Kamurocho yakuza‚Ä¶ Made you famous, huh?

Young Lady: Oh‚Ä¶ Inspector Kawara‚Ä¶

Kawara: Miss, I might suggest you choose your role models more carefully. You‚Äôll go a lot further here if you learn from somebody with some discipline, right?

[Young girl leaves.]

Date: Killer Kawara‚Ä¶ What brings you here?

Kawara: Hadn‚Äôt you heard? I‚Äôm a detective with Foreign Affairs now.

Date: A guy who put that many holes in people in Foreign Affairs? Sounds like a bad joke.

Kawara: You make me sound like a monster. Besides, it‚Äôs been years‚Ä¶

Date: Yeah well, I still remember it like it was yesterday.

Kawara: Was watching some scumbags take a bullet really all that traumatic?

Date: Maybe. Not that it really matters now. I don‚Äôt figure we‚Äôll ever cross paths again.

[He walks away but Kawara grabs his shoulder.]

Kawara: Wait a sec. I hate to disappoint, but‚Ä¶

Date: Huh?

Kawara: Sudo called you here, right? He‚Äôs waiting for us. Follow me.

[They walk together.]

Date: Floor B3‚Ä¶ Kind of an odd path to take, isn‚Äôt it?

Kawara: Nervous?

Date: Yeah, maybe. Nothing but bad rumors float up from this place.

Kawara: Third floor basement, archive room 13‚Ä¶. The "forbidden room" of Tokyo PD.

Date: Yeah. Also known as the "scandal graveyard."

[Kawara enters a code near the door and they enter the room. There‚Äôs Sudo and some other guy sitting at a table.]

Date: Hey. Here he is.

Sudo: Date-san‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry to drag you down here.

Date: Right‚Ä¶

Sudo: I‚Äôll introduce you. This is Superintendent Kurahashi, chief of Foreign Affairs Division Two.

[WATARU KURAHASHI. Tokyo Metropolitan Police Chief Division Two: Foreign Affairs.]

Kurahashi: I‚Äôve heard the stories, Date-san. I‚Äôm Kurahashi.

Date: Foreign Affairs Division Two? What‚Äôs Asian Affairs doing down here?

Sudo: As I told you yesterday, Division Four is monitoring the Omi Alliance activity.

Date: Yeah‚Ä¶ the Terada murder, right?

Sudo: Yes. We suspect some foreign influence‚Ä¶ A Chinese or Korean group may be involved.

Date: You mean a foreign mafia?

Kurahashi: Actually‚Ä¶ Division Two has been monitoring Asian mafia activity for about a year now. We‚Äôre picking up chatter about some big shifts lately. It only confirmed our suspicions‚Ä¶ And we expected something big to go down.

Date: You did?

Sudo: I‚Äôd been monitoring Kamurocho for weeks ‚Äôon secret orders from Chief Kurahashi. Sure enough‚Ä¶

Date: A bomb goes off.

Sudo: Precisely. We were right all along.

Date: But‚Ä¶ What does all that have to do with you in Division Four?

[Sudo puts a photo of Ryuji Goda on the table.]

Sudo: Second patriarch of the Omi Alliance‚Äôs Go-Ryu Clan. A man named Ryuji Goda.

Date: Ryuji Goda‚Ä¶

Sudo: An Omi higher-up we suspect led the Terada hit.

Date: Okay, what about him?

Sudo: Our intelligence picked up a conversation Goda had, conspiring with the bomber.

[Kurahashi takes out a tape recorder and turns it on.]

Tape Recorder (Ryuji): But just so we‚Äôre clear, I ain‚Äôt one of your boys. Seein‚Äô Kamurocho go up in a sea of flames‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the common goal here. Once this job‚Äôs over, we‚Äôre strangers. Ya got that?

Man: Sure. You just enjoy the show.

Sudo: The man with the Kansai accent is probably Ryuji Goda.

Date: I get it. So now Divisions Two and Four are trying to figure out who the other guy is.

Kurahashi: Right again. First we have to ID this guy.

[We see a diagram on the table with different signatures. Above Ryuji‚Äôs picture is written ÈÉéÁî∞ÈæçÂè∏ (Goda Ryuji) and below the photo (ËøëÊ±üÈÄ£Âêà) (Omi Alliance).It connected to Êµ∑Â§ñÁµÑÁπî (Overseas Organization). Above the recorder it says <ÈõªË©±> (Phone). The place where Kurahashi points is marked with a circle.]

Kurahashi: Using that, we hope to uncover the organization connected to the Omi.

Date: You have a location?

Kurahashi: We tried eliminating all the line noise, but we still can‚Äôt pinpoint the location.

Date: So‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs all this about a case only I can handle?

Kurahashi: You see, Date-san‚Ä¶ We need you to get close to this man.

[He places a photo of some guy on the table.]

Date: Hm? That‚Äôs..

Kurahashi: Yes‚Ä¶ Someone you know very well, Date-san. Owner of the Kamurocho host club, Stardust. Alias, "Kazuki."

Date: Why Kazuki?

Sudo: Six months ago Ryuji Goda came to Kamurocho, just once. The man he met with was Kazuki.

Date: How is that enough to‚Äî

Kurahashi: That‚Äôs not all. He has another nameen A real name, aside from "Kazuki."

Date: Another name?

Kurahashi: Jinwu Kang. He‚Äôs a bonafide Korean.

Sudo: We‚Äôd like you to approach him subtly and apply a little pressure. Is he Korean mafia or not?

Kurahashi: That‚Äôs what we need you to find out. After last year‚Äôs events, he trusts you implicitly. You‚Äôre the only man for this job, Date-san.

[Next scene. Kaoru drives with cuffed Kiryu.]

Where are you taking me? Hey, you listening?

[Kaoru pulls off.]

Kaoru: We should be safe this far out.

Kiryu: What do you mean by that?

Kaoru: The assault charge was just a cover.

[She uncuffs Kiryu.]

Kaoru: I was asked to take you into protective custody.

Kiryu: Protective custody?

Kaoru: Try to give me the slip, and I‚Äôll arrest you for real.

[Kiryu notices a sniper on a nearby roof and tries to cover Kaoru.]

Kiryu: Get down!

[The sniper disappears after 2 shots.]

Kiryu: Where were you hit?

Kaoru: I-It‚Äôs nothing‚Ä¶

Kiryu: The bullet‚Äôs still in there‚Ä¶ This is gonna get bad. Hey, where‚Äôs the nearest hospital?

Kaoru: Sotenbori‚Ä¶

Kiryu: What?

Kaoru: In Sotenbori‚Ä¶ Find a‚Ä¶ bar called Aoi‚Ä¶

[She loses consciousness.]

Kiryu: (The bar was called Aoi. I better find it fast.)

Find Aoi
[He runs through the city.]

Kiryu: (This must be the place she wanted me to find.)

[He walk in the place called „Çπ„Éä„ÉÉ„ÇØËëµ (Snack Bar Aoi). Aoi means hollyhock. On the second sign we can read Âëë„ÅøÂá¶ (drinking place or a pub) and È£ü„ÅÑÂá¶ (eating place or a canteen). It‚Äôs a tavern! Some woman, presumably a bartender, smoking and sweeping the floor.]

Bartender: Who the hell are you?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm Kiryu, but I‚Äî

Bartender: It‚Äôs like a different thug every week‚Ä¶ Send all ya like. I can‚Äôt pay what I can‚Äôt pay!

Kiryu: What?

Bartender: It‚Äôs protection money yer after, yeah?

Kiryu: Do you know a woman named Kaoru Sayama?

Bartender: Kaoru? What of her?

Kiryu: She‚Äôs hurt.

Bartender: Where is she!?

Kiryu: I left her in the car.

Bartender: Then haul your ass back and get her!

[Kiryu runs to the car.]

Kiryu: (She‚Äôs hurt worse than I thought! If I don‚Äôt hurry‚Ä¶!)

[Kiryu brings Kaoru to the tavern.]

Kiryu: Where do you want her?

Tamiyo: Here, lay her down!

[We sneakily learn the bartender‚Äôs name through subtitles. Kiryu leaves the tavern.]

Kiryu: (I‚Äôm sure rd just be in the way in there. I‚Äôll check back in a few.)

[Daigo calls him.]

Daigo: Hey, it‚Äôs Daigo.

Kiryu: How are things on your end?

Daigo: We‚Äôre okay for now. Chairman Coda‚Äôs with We‚Äôre heading toward Kamurocho by car.

Kiryu: Good. How are you holding up, though?

Daigo: I‚Äôll make it. I‚Äôm not built like a truck like you, but I can still take a punch.   

Kiryu: Heh, good to know. This alliance is in your hands right now.

Daigo: Yeah, I know. Later, then.

[Kiryu takes a bit of time to rest and then he gets a call from Tamiyo.]

Tamiyo: It‚Äôs me, from Aoi.

Kiryu: Oh, hi. How‚Äôs she doing?

Tamiyo: Calmed down. finally. Medicine‚Äôs doin‚Äô job now so she‚Äôs nappin‚Äô.   

Kiryu: That‚Äôs good.

Tamiyo: Anyhow. sorry to bother ya, but do ya think ya could pick up some more bandages, sugar? I‚Äôm out, and if this thing opens up again‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yeah, no problem. I‚Äôll pick some up on my way back.

Tamiyo: You‚Äôre a doll. Talk to ya soon.

[Kiryu buys bandages and returns to Aoi. There are various household chemicals on the table - the operation was clearly carried out in an improvised manner. Kaoru is asleep on the couch.]

Kiryu: (to Tamiyo) You ever work at a hospital? You know what you‚Äôre doing.

Tamiyo: Yeah, way back.

Kiryu: I figured. You and Sayama must be close.

Tamiyo: Close? That‚Äôs an understatement! I‚Äôm her ma, sugar.

Kiryu: What?

Tamiyo: I mean, not by blood or nothin‚Äô‚Ä¶ But a ma‚Äôs a ma.

Kiryu: So you‚Äôre her foster mother?

Tamiyo: Close, but I‚Äôm just the ma who raised her. Kiddo‚Äôs an orphan.

Kiryu: An orphan‚Ä¶

Tamiyo: Her folks died not long after she was born So I took her in.

Kiryu: I see‚Ä¶ That explains it.

Tamiyo: Explains what now?

Kiryu: When she was shot, she told me to find a bar called Aoi‚Ä¶

Tamiyo: Yeah‚Ä¶ And?

Kiryu: A bar‚Äôs not exactly the first place people throw out in that situation. They‚Äôd start with "my mom" or "my dad."

Tamiyo: Hmm‚Ä¶ Ya think? What makes ya so sure?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm an orphan, too.

Tamiyo: Oh yeah? Well, it‚Äôs true enough I ain‚Äôt Kaoru‚Äôs real ma.

Kiryu: Sorry‚Ä¶ Did I offend you?

Tamiyo: Nah, don‚Äôt sweat it! I ain‚Äôt the type to get huffy bout that stuff.

Kiryu: Yeah?

Tamiyo: So anyway, are ya a coworker of Kaoru‚Äôs? Or maybe‚Ä¶ a private eye?

Kiryu: No‚Ä¶ Nothing that respectable.

Tamiyo: Eh? What then?

Kiryu: Well‚Ä¶ Sort of the opposite of the police‚Ä¶

Tamiyo: What?

Kaoru: Mama‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs prob ªly enough chitchat.

Kiryu: Does it hurt much?

Kaoru: You got no reason to worry ‚Äôbout me.

Tamiyo: Honey, that‚Äôs cold. He carried ya all the way here. How bout some gratitude?

Kaoru: I ain‚Äôt so far gone to be sayin‚Äô thanks to a yakuza.

Tamiyo: Some days, hon, I‚Äî

Kiryu: It‚Äôs okay. If she‚Äôs got that much fire in her, she‚Äôll be fine. Still, I‚Äôm surprised Ryuji Goda was able to put a hit out that quickly.

Kaoru: (holds a bullet) This‚Ä¶ This isn‚Äôt Ryuji Goda‚Äôs style.

Kiryu: What?

Kaoru: The Go-Ryu Clan muscles their way straight at their enemies and puts them down. Simple and to the point. They wouldn‚Äôt bother with the complexities of hiring a professional sniper.

Kiryu: That was a pro?

Kaoru: You think guys who can handle a rifle from that distance grow on trees? Plus, this bullet‚Ä¶

Kiryu: What about it?

Kaoru: Compared to a standard rifle round, it‚Äôs way smaller. It‚Äôs possible he wasn‚Äôt shooting to kill.

Kiryu: So, what‚Ä¶ They wanted to intimidate me?

Kaoru: That, I don‚Äôt know. We‚Äôd have to ask the guy who shot me‚Ä¶ Where are you going?

Kiryu: To find who put out the hit. As it stands now‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know who I‚Äôm fighting.

Kaoru: In that case‚Ä¶ Take this to the mahjong parlor in Shofukucho.

[He hands Kiryu the bullet.]

Kiryu: An info dealer?

Kaoru: Look for the guy in the padded vest at a table with three people. You ask, "What‚Äôs the rate?" Then he‚Äôll ask what you usually play for. You reply with, "It‚Äôs your call."

Kiryu: "It‚Äôs your call"‚Ä¶?

Kaoru: Right. Then he‚Äôll give you a crazy rate. Accept it.

Kiryu: All right.

Kaoru: One more thing. Let me remind you‚Ä¶ The Osaka Prefectural Police are watching. Don‚Äôt even think about skipping town. I put out the call, and your ass goes to jail. We clear?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Meet With The Information Dealer
[Kiryu finds the mahjong parlor.]

Staff: Excuse me!? Tonight‚Äôs an invite-only tournament. Can‚Äôt let folks without invitations just waltz in.

Mahjong Lover: Brushed off at the mahjong parlor, right? Askin‚Äô fer invitations and all, thinkin‚Äô they‚Äôre all big shots or somethin‚Äô. What, ya gotta be as good as Jongka just to get into the place now?

Kiryu: Sorry, Jongka?

Mahjong Lover: Any mahjong player worth his salt would bout piss his pants at hearin‚Äô the man‚Äôs name! So the three top dogs in underground mahjong were Jongka, Jongko, and Jongen. But Jongka up n‚Äô quit mahjong, and now he just wastes away at an arcade‚Ä¶ Got addicted to them UFO catcher machines. Kinda sad story.

[Kiryu walks into the nearest arcade and finds an elderly man in a hat.]

Kiryu: Are you Longka?

Longka: Hey, buddy. Think ya could snag me one of them prizes? See them kitty cats? I got my eye on the red one.

I‚Äôm kinda busy here.
Sure, sounds good. +

Kiryu: I can try, but then we‚Äôve gotta talk.

Longka: Yeah? Thanks, buddy.

[Kiryu snags the toy - Kitty Cat (Red).]

Longka: Whoa! Nice job, buddy! Aww, Yukiko‚Äôll love this! Y-Yukiko‚Ä¶

Kiryu: So you are Jongka, aren‚Äôt you?

Longka: There was a time when I went by that name‚Ä¶ But I gave up the game.

Kiryu: Why‚Äôd you stop?

Longka: Wouldn‚Äôt have, if those dirty yakuza hadn‚Äôt cheated me! Bastards forced me into debt! I was doing okay running away from ‚Äòem‚Ä¶ But now the sons of bitches have my little girl, Yukiko. They‚Äôre tellin‚Äô me if I ever want to see her again, I‚Äôve gotta give ‚Äòem five million yen‚Ä¶ Say! Ya wouldn‚Äôt happen to have five million I could have, would ya!? Not exactly a thing ya up and ask a guy, is it?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm sorry, but all I‚Äôm really after is an invitation to Riichi Towers.

Longka: Riichi Towers? Ya mean ya need a cherry blossom tile? See, it‚Äôs a special tile they made to act kinda like a membership card. Tell ya what, you get my baby girl back, and this tile‚Äôs all yours. Ya look like you can handle a tough crowd‚Ä¶ Am I right?

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶When I have to. But fine, I‚Äôll help you.

Longka: You will!? No shit!? Well, ya know those coin lockers across Bishamon Bridge? There‚Äôs a guy waitin‚Äô by those. He‚Äôs expectin‚Äô five million yen, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure ya can figure it out. Don‚Äôt you let ‚Äòem hurt my sweet Yukiko though‚Ä¶

[Kiryu runs to the coin lockers.]

Yakuza: Huh!? Who the fuck are you!?

Kiryu: Let‚Äôs just say Jongka sent me.

Yakuza: What the fuck happened to him? You got the money?

Kiryu: The last thing you‚Äôre getting from me is money.

Yakuza: Gaah ha ha! What a joke. Here‚Äôs how we deal with guys who fuck around!

[Kiryu kicks their asses.]

Yakuza: Mercy! Mercy, man! Look, the girl, she‚Äôs.

She‚Äôs by the river, near the umbrella. The guy in red clothes has her. ‚Ä¶Yawowowow!

[The yakuzas run away. Kiryu finds the man in red.]

Man in Red: Hey! Help me out here, man! Take this damn cat off my hands! Givin‚Äô this devil cat a pretty girl‚Äôs name like Yukiko‚Ä¶ The fuzzbag nearly scratched my face off!

Kiryu: You‚Äôre telling me Yukiko is a cat?

[He takes the cat to Jongka.]

Longka: Ah! Yukiko! You poor thing! Thank god you‚Äôre safe!

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Longka: Well, here‚Äôs the cherry blossom tile. Deal‚Äôs a deal. And you can have this too. It‚Äôs a mahjong strategy guide that might help ya out. I wrote it myself, actually.

[Kiryu goes back to Riichi Towers.]

Staff: Excuse me!? Tonight‚Äôs an invite-only tournament. Can‚Äôt let folks without invitations just waltz in.

Kiryu: And what if I have one of these?

Staff: Oh, how‚Äôd ya come across that? Not that it matters. Come on in.

[Kiryu enters the tournament.]

Kiryu: (I need to find the man in a padded vest‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Him?) Hey, what‚Äôs your rate?

Esaki: How much ya usually play for?

5,000 yen
10,000 yen
It‚Äôs your call. +

Kiryu: It‚Äôs your call.

Esaki: 40 million yen. Win, and you could fuckin‚Äô buy Osaka Castle.

{40 million yen is about $335,000}

Kiryu: Fine by me.

Esaki: ‚Ä¶So whaddaya wanna know?

Kiryu: What can you tell me about this bullet? I need to know where it came from.

Esaki: 100 grand‚Ä¶ Take it or leave it.

{100 grand equvalent $840}

Kiryu: I don‚Äôt have that kind of cash. I‚Äôll be back when I do.

[Kiryu collects the required amount of money and returns to the mahjong parlor.]

Esaki: That info‚Äôs gonna run ya 100 grand. Ya got the cash?   

[Kiryu pays.]

Esaki: (holding the bullet) This here‚Äôs Omi. Takashima Family.

Kiryu: Takashima‚Ä¶?

[Kiryu recalls meeting Takashima at the Omi Alliance building.]

Takashima: (from Kiryu‚Äôs memory) Yes, Terada ‚Äì No, the Tojo Clan‚Äôs fifth chairman was my sworn brother.

Esaki: That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ Bullet like this? The only guns that use ‚Äôem are smuggled in from the mainland. And the guy who‚Äôs got that market cornered in Kansai‚Ä¶ is Takashima.

Kiryu: Any chance Takashima is reselling them?

Esaki: Nope. Takashima ain‚Äôt big on risk, and that‚Äôs a rickety bridge. Any trails would lead right back to him. Only reason ya smuggle in guns is ‚Äôcause it‚Äôs cheaper that way.

Kiryu: So if this is common knowledge, why haven‚Äôt the police taken action?

Esaki: Beats me‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt ask questions. But‚Ä¶

Kiryu: But‚Ä¶?

Esaki: Uh-oh, ‚Äôfraid not. Me n‚Äô my big mouth. I‚Äôve told ya all I‚Äôm gonna tell ya‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Why would Takashima‚Ä¶?

[Meanwhile Takashima talks to the sniper on the phone.]

Takashima: So, it went according to plan?

Sniper: Yes. A non-fatal wound, just like you asked, boss.

Takashima: And the bullet?

Sniper: Also like you asked. Unless this Kiryu guy‚Äôs a moron, we‚Äôre fine. He‚Äôll trace the hit right to us from the bullet in the car.

Takashima: Good.

Sniper: But, can I ask why, sir?

Takashima: Because now he knows he can‚Äôt trust anyone‚Ä¶ And that‚Äôs enough for now.

Sniper: Understood, boss. So‚Ä¶ What do we do next?

Takashima: Stand by. Let‚Äôs let him float for a while. We have plenty of time.

Sniper: Understood. Bye then.

[When the camera moves behind the door of the room where Takashima is, you can see that he is in ÂèñË™øÂÆ§ (Interrogation Room). Chief Tsutomu enters.]

Tsutomu: You really talkin‚Äô on the phone in here? This interrogation a joke to you!?

Takashima: It was just a business call. I‚Äôm a busy man.

Tsutomu: Oh yeah, a real yakuza hotshot! We know all about the shit you‚Äôre floatin‚Äô upstream! Word is, you‚Äôre headin‚Äô up a rifle smugglin‚Äô operation?

Takashima: This is all voluntary at this point, yes? I‚Äôm under no obligation to answer you. Besides, aren‚Äôt you getting off topic?

Tsutomu: Not really?

Takashima: We‚Äôre the victims here. If you‚Äôre going to make arrests, shouldn‚Äôt it be Kazuma Kiryu?

Tsutomu: Your buddies didn‚Äôt seem to think so. Aren‚Äôt you people on Kiryu‚Äôs side here?

Takashima: How absurd‚Ä¶ Again, the Omi are victims. Why don‚Äôt you just have your little lady cop arrest him? That‚Äôs simple enough, right?

Tsutomu: How‚Äôd you know ‚Äôbout Sayama?

Takashima: It doesn‚Äôt matter. By the way, Bessho-san. Have you heard anything from your superintendent yet?

Tsutomu: Yeah, sure did! Told me to send ya on yer merry way. You can go. Move along now.

Takashima: Can I now? Very well.

[He walks to the door.]

Tsutomu: Takashima! Whatever the hell you‚Äôre playing at‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care who ya know up top around here. But you join up with those Go-Ryu fucks, and I‚Äôll bust your wrinkly ass. We clear on that?

Takashima: Bessho-san‚Ä¶ That police versus yakuza mentality? It‚Äôs a thing of the past.

[He leaves the interrogation room. Kiryu continue too talk to Esaki.]

Kiryu: There‚Äôs something else I want to know.

Esaki: What‚Äôs that?

Kiryu: The rest of the story‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs Takashima really up to?

Esaki: That‚Äôs extra‚Ä¶ Think ya can afford it?

Kiryu: How much?

Esaki: 300 grand. Can‚Äôt make it a lick cheaper. Time to hit the bank, buddy.

Kiryu: (I‚Äôm not paying that. Maybe Kurokawa can help me out on this one.)

[Kiryu finds Kurokawa on the streets.]

Kurokawa: Yo, Kiryu-han! How‚Äôs it hangin‚Äô?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm having a problem with an information dealer named Esaki. Ever heard of him?   

Kurokawa: Esaki? Ehhh, you fallin‚Äô in with bad crowds now, Kiryu-han? The guy looked me up once, though‚Ä¶ Askin‚Äô about the price of ‚Äúalmonds." Dunno what ‚Äúalmonds‚Äù are, myself, and that‚Äôs how I suggest ya keep it, ‚Äôcause rm sure it ain‚Äôt pretty. Oh yeah! Y‚Äôknow somethin‚Äô? I forget where, but I recall a local barkeep talkin‚Äô about almonds too‚Ä¶ Sketchy bastard. Somethin‚Äô about 100 grand, 200 grand a pop‚Ä¶ Too rich for my blood!    Maybe the bartender could give ya the scoop if ya manage to track him down.

Kiryu: Maybe I will. Thanks.

[Kiryu runs to Stijl to talk to the bartender. It‚Äôs quite a classy place.]

Bartender: Welcome. sir.

Kiryu: Hey, I‚Äôve heard you‚Äôre the guy to ask about ‚Äúalmonds.‚Äù

Bartender: Hmm? Perhaps I am. Interested?

Kiryu: Maybe. But what would that run me?

Bartender: 100,000 yen, sir.

Kiryu: Pricey, aren‚Äôt they? But good to know.

Bartender: Do I have your interest, sir? I‚Äôd need you to pay up front.

Kiryu: No, I think I‚Äôm all right. Thanks for the tip.

[Having the information Kiryu returns to the mahjong parlor.]

Kiryu: I‚Äôve heard you‚Äôre a big player in the almond market. Is that something you‚Äôd like to discuss?

Esaki: Hey, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Fine. Let‚Äôs drop that and call this a fair trade, eh? Takashima‚Äôs a Touto U grad with connections to all sortsa government officials. But his loyalty to the Omi Alliance‚Äôs fifth chairman is what got him to where he is today‚Ä¶ Now he‚Äôs top Of the food chain. Can‚Äôt remember a time when he wasn‚Äôt an officer.

[Esaki‚Äôs phone ringing.]

Esaki: Eh? Ya serious? Gotchya.

Kiryu: Thanks for your help.

Esaki: Hey, just a sec now‚Ä¶ Kazuma Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: How do you know my name?

Esaki: Buddy‚Ä¶ Ya just turned into 100 million yen!

Kiryu: What the hell?

Esaki: It‚Äôs a bounty man. Nothin‚Äô personal. Put 100 mil on a guy‚Äôs head, who wouldn‚Äôt jump at it?

Kiryu: 100 million‚Ä¶ A little on the cheap side, no?

Esaki: True, considerin‚Äô this is a Tojo ex-chairman we‚Äôre talkin‚Äô here‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs a helluva payday for us. ‚ÄôFraid you‚Äôve gotta die now!

[Kiryu forced to defend himself, but he went a little overboard and covered the floor with battered mahjong players.]

Kiryu: Who put the bounty on my head!?

Esaki: Who knows?

[Kiryu bangs his head against the table so that the mahjong chips stick to his face.]

Esaki: S-Stop! Th-The Sengoku Family!

Kiryu: This the Sengoku I think it is?

Esaki: E-Exactly!

[Kiryu recalls the cocky man with the fan he saw at the meeting with Goda.]

Toranosuke: (in Kiryu‚Äôs memory) What? Handle this however ya damn please. If ya need money to cover Terada‚Äôs incense, just lemme know, yeah?

Esaki: Goda, Takashima, and Sengoku are on your ass. You‚Äôre outta options, buddy.

Kiryu: Why put a price on me?

Esaki: You‚Äôre the finish line at the end of their race‚Ä¶.

Kiryu: Me?

[Meanwhile, in Sengoku‚Äôs office‚Ä¶]

Sengoku Thug: (on the phone) Got it‚Ä¶ So Kiryu walked outta the mahjong parlor in one piece? ‚Ä¶Alright. (hungs up) (to Toranosuke) Waste o‚Äô time, hittin‚Äô up that lady cop‚Äôs stool pigeon and buyin‚Äô out those broke-ass info dealers‚Ä¶

Toranosuke: Guess an amateur couldn‚Äôt hack it against Kiryu.

Sengoku Thug: So, what‚Äôs our next move?

Toranosuke: We chill out let ‚Äôim take in Osaka for a bit.

Sengoku Thug: But boss, what if the Go-Ryu boys get to him first?

Toranosuke: What can that man-baby actually do? Kid‚Äôll probably pick a fight head-on and land his sorry ass in jail. Meanwhile, Kiryu‚Äôs gonna hightail it back to Kamurocho. If n‚Äô when he does, brat-boy‚Äôs gonna give chase‚Ä¶ So before that‚Ä¶

[Two thugs bring a large box full of money.]

Toranosuke: Here‚Äôs a cool bil. Make it rain in Kamurocho.

Sengoku Thug: You got it, boss.

[Back to Kiryu.]

Kiryu: (I should be getting back to Aoi.)

[He meets two strange man on the way.]

Man 1: Four Shine is practically a trash heap. What if we were to offer you a position with us?

Kiryu: Hm?

Man 2: O-Oh, but‚Ä¶ They made an offer, and I already accepted it‚Ä¶

Man 1: In that case, I‚Äôm prepared to pay double what Four Shine offered. How does that sound?

Man 2: What!? Double!? Sign me up! Forget Four Shine, I‚Äôm your man!

Man 1: That‚Äôs excellent enthusiasm. I look forward to working with you, Kiritani-san.

[They walk away.]

Kiryu: (Sounds like Four Shine lost a hire. It‚Äôs a shame that talent sniping is such a common issue in this business‚Ä¶) Hm? Four Shine? They stole that guy from right outside their club?

[While Kiryu is looking at the sign, a young girl with glasses comes running out of the club.]

Excited Girl: Aaaaah! You‚Äôre here! I‚Äôve been waiting for you forever!

Kiryu: Hm?

Excited Girl: It‚Äôs such a blessing to have someone with your experience join the team! Thank you so much, Kiritani-san! Or should I say, Floor Manager Kiritani!

Kiryu: You‚Äôre confused, lady. The name‚Äôs Kiryu.

Excited Girl: Kiryu? I could‚Äôve sworn it was Kiritani‚Ä¶ Oh well! Anyway, come on inside! Come, come, come!

Kiryu: Wh-Whoa‚Ä¶

[She pushes Kiryu into the club.]

Excited Girl: Koyuki-chan! Our new manager‚Äôs here!

Koyuki: We‚Äôve been waiting for you, Kiritani-san! ‚Ä¶Huh?

Excited Girl: What‚Äôs the matter, Koyuki-chan?

Koyuki: This guy looks pretty different than the picture on his file‚Ä¶

Excited Girl: Maybe he‚Äôs just not very photogenic? He could be sensitive about that, you know!? If you wanna get to the top of the hostess biz, you can‚Äôt just blurt that kinda stuff out!

Koyuki: Yeah but‚Ä¶ The difference is like night and day here‚Ä¶ Any chance you grabbed the wrong guy?

Excited Girl: The wrong guy!? Koyuki-chan, don‚Äôt even go there‚Ä¶ (looking at Kiryu) Hmm? Hmmmm‚Ä¶? Hmmmmmmmmmm!? He‚Äôs the wrong guy!

Koyuki: That‚Äôs what I just said!

Kiryu: (What the hell is happening right now‚Ä¶)

Excited Girl: I can‚Äôt apologize enough for this, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: Don‚Äôt worry about it. You‚Äôre the‚Ä¶ owner, I take it?

Excited Girl: Yes, apologies for the late introduction. I‚Äôm the owner of Club Four Shine, Yuki. And this is our number one girl, Koyuki-chan.

Koyuki: Nice to meet you! I‚Äôm Koyuki.

Kiryu: Oh, number one, huh? That‚Äôs pretty amazing.

Koyuki: Thank you very much‚Ä¶ We say number one, but.. We only have three girls working here‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Just three?

Yuki: And I double as the owner and staff‚Ä¶ We haven‚Äôt been able to open the doors here for a while due to the shortage‚Ä¶ We were struggling to hire new staff, but then we got lucky with Kiritani-san.

Koyuki: Speaking of Kiritani-san, he‚Äôs running awfully late‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yeah, about Kiritani‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think you should count on him showing up.

Yuki: Huh?

Kiryu: I just saw him get bought out by some other guy in a suit. He offered him double whatever Four Shine could pay him‚Ä¶

Yuki: N-No way‚Ä¶

Koyuki: What do we do? We already spent a ton of money advertising that we‚Äôd be re-opening to get customers in‚Ä¶

Yuki: Not good‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll take a huge loss if we can‚Äôt open, not to mention our reputation taking a nose dive‚Ä¶ Ahh, what do we do!? If only we had one more person on staff to help us out‚Ä¶

Koyuki: Hm?

Yuki: Hm?

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Yuki & Koyuki: ‚Ä¶Hmmmmm?

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Yuki & Koyuki: ‚Ä¶Hmmmmmmmm!?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm not doing it!

Yuki: Won‚Äôt you please reconsider!? If we don‚Äôt open tonight, our club‚Äôs dead in the water! We‚Äôll even pay you a full day‚Äôs salary‚Ä¶ Won‚Äôt you please do it!?

Kiryu: Easy to say‚Ä¶ But you know I‚Äôve never been a cabaret club manager, right?

Yuki: You‚Äôll be fine! Our club is very welcoming to beginners!

Koyuki: And you‚Äôll have our full support, too!

Kiryu: Still‚Ä¶

Yuki: Please, Kiryu-san. Opening our doors is so important to our customers today‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt imagine betraying all the customers who‚Äôve been looking forward to this‚Ä¶.

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Yuki: I‚Äôm know we‚Äôre asking the impossible‚Ä¶ But, please!

Koyuki: Please!

Kiryu: I guess I‚Äôm in‚Ä¶ But just this once.

Yuki: Yes!? You‚Äôll do it!?

Kiryu: Yeah, but I‚Äôm totally green at this. Don‚Äôt get your hopes up, okay?

Yuki: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ Thank you so much!

Koyuki: Yuki-san! We‚Äôve gotta get ready to open!

Yuki: Right! Well, Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ Er, Mr. Manager! I look forward to working with you!

[Kiryu greets new customers with a bow.]

Kiryu: Welcome‚Ä¶ sir.

Girls: Welcome!

[Kiryu works a full day helping girls out.]

Girls: Thank you for coming!

Kiryu: Whew‚Ä¶ We made it through!

Yuki: Kiryu-san, we owe you one! Was that really your first time!? You were so good!

Koyuki: I agree! Kiryu-san, you‚Äôre a natural at this!

Kiryu: Heh, don‚Äôt flatter me. But I‚Äôm impressed by the club. The customers really seem to love it here.

Yuki: Thank you!

[Man 1 with a girl in red dress suddenly enters.]

Man 1: My, my. And I was sure you‚Äôd be drowning in your sorrows, considering the loss of your manager‚Ä¶ Are you enjoying yourselves?

Kiryu: That‚Äôs the guy who stole your hire..

Koyuki: Kanzaki-san‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Kanzaki?

Koyuki: He‚Äôs the chairman of the Kanzaki Group, a huge cabaret club conglomerate. And he‚Äôs been harassing us at every chance he gets‚Ä¶

Kanzaki: Koyuki-chan, you‚Äôre still scraping by at this heap? Wouldn‚Äôt a cutie like you fare better with us?

Koyuki: N-Not a chance!

Kanzaki: Mm, cold as ice‚Ä¶ Well, I suppose that‚Äôs part of your charm.

Yuki: Kanzaki-kun‚Ä¶ Why are you here? Did you come to stir up trouble again?

Kanzaki: You wound me, Yuki-san! I came today to bring you this‚Ä¶

[He gives her a flyer.]

Yuki: I-Is this‚Ä¶

Kanzaki: A flyer for the Cabaret Club Grand Prix!

Yuki: Cabaret Club Grand Prix!?

Kiryu: What is that?

Koyuki: Cabaret clubs across the nation compete in a contest of sales. It‚Äôs the event of events in this industry! The Grand Prix‚Äôs winner is practically guaranteed to sky rocket in popularity.

Kiryu: Really? I‚Äôve never heard of it.

Koyuki: Yes, and last year‚Äôs champion‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Was the club run by Kirara-san here, the Sotenbori Sunshine. The largest club in the Kanzaki Group‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶With the highest sales in Japan.

Kirara: Hi there!

Kanzaki: And under the most incredible circumstances‚Ä¶ Four Shine has been invited to compete!

Koyuki: Whaaaaaaaaat!?

Yuki: But with the number of girls we have, Four Shine shouldn‚Äôt meet the entry requirements‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs going on here?

Kanzaki: Well, as a former colleague, couldn‚Äôt just watch as Four Shine shut down in ignominy‚Ä¶ So I spoke with the organizers‚Ä¶ And I asked them to make a special exception this year. Really‚Ä¶ You ought to be thanking me here.

Kirara: Oh don‚Äôt be coy‚Ä¶ You just wanted to finish off Four Shine yourself, didn‚Äôt you?

Yuki: Finish us?

Kirara: With the Grand Prix drawing the strongest clubs across country‚Ä¶ How could little old Four Shine hope to compete? A blunder there would be the doom of any club‚Äôs profits and reputation‚Ä¶ Considering the financial woes Four Shine‚Äôs already having. Could you survive such a fall?

Yuki: No way‚Ä¶

Kanzaki: Woah, woah, woah, let‚Äôs not reveal our whole hand, Kirara‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs just rude.

Yuki: Ergh‚Ä¶!

Kanzaki: Well‚Ä¶ Give it your best shot, Four Shine! Take care‚Ä¶ And see you at the tournament.

[They‚Äôre leaving. Koyuki makes an obscene gesture.]

Koyuki: Annnd choke on it!

Yuki: What now‚Ä¶?

Koyuki: Yuki-san, we should contact the organizers and withdraw!

Yuki: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Koyuki: Yuki-san?

Yuki: Koyuki-chan‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre doing the Cabaret Club Grand Prix.

Koyuki: Huh!? B-But‚Ä¶

Yuki: Whether we compete or not, Four Shine‚Äôs on the brink of closing. I know our chances are slim of course‚Ä¶ But even if it‚Äôs a tiny chance, even if we embarrass ourselves, I want to bet on us. I won‚Äôt just roll over. If we‚Äôre going to go down we may as well go down fighting, right?

Koyuki: Yuki-san‚Ä¶

Yuki: Besides‚Ä¶ I still believe in us and this club. It‚Äôs small, but it puts the customer above anything else‚Ä¶

Koyuki: And how can a place like that lose, you know?

Kiryu: Heh.

Koyuki: You‚Äôre right! Let‚Äôs do it, Yuki-san!

Yuki: Good! Then we‚Äôre agreed that we charge into battle! Kiryu-san, you‚Äôve got this!

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ Wha!? Me too!?

Yuki: (begging) Oh please! You‚Äôre one of us now! And you‚Äôre a natural at this, Kiryu-san! C‚Äômon!

Kiryu: Easy for you to say‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve got a lot going on, you know.

Yuki: You can help whenever you find the time! We‚Äôll pay you and you‚Äôll learn from it too! Please, please!

Kiryu: Geez‚Ä¶ What a world‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll do it.

Koyuki: Perfect! Kiryu-san, let‚Äôs get this club climbing through the ranks of the Cabaret Club League!

Kiryu: Sure.

Yuki: Oh, I know! We finally have a new coworker, so why don‚Äôt we do the thing!? You know!?

Koyuki: Good idea!

Kiryu: What now?

[They do a dance.]

Girls: Here goes! One‚Ä¶! Two‚Ä¶! Three‚Ä¶! Four Shine!

[Kiryu‚Äôs face at this moment is priceless.]

Yuki: Nice! We still got it!

Koyuki: Kiryu-san, you caught that, right? You‚Äôre doing it next time too.

Kiryu: Oh‚Ä¶ Uhhh‚Ä¶ (quietly) Oh man‚Ä¶ What kind of nonsense have I gotten myself into now?

[Kiryu returns to his life and goes to Aoi. As he approaches the bar door he hears the voices of Tamiyo and Kaoru. He stops to eavesdrop on them.]

Tamiyo: Ya can‚Äôt keep doin‚Äô this to yourself!

Kaoru: This again!?

Tamiyo: Why ya gotta be so stubborn!?

Kaoru: Because you keep yer lips sealed, Mama!

Tamiyo: I‚Äôve told ya plenty! They had nothin‚Äô to do with the yakuza!

Kaoru: Then tell me! Who are my real parents!? This is goin‚Äô in circles‚Ä¶ Say what ya want, I‚Äôm following Kazuma Kiryu.

Tamiyo: But why?

Kaoru: Because he‚Äôs Tojo, that‚Äôs why.

Tamiyo: He is!?

Kaoru: With him in my custody. I can get closer to the Tajo Clan. Whatever happened.. I‚Äôll finally be close enough to dig it up.

Tamiyo: Kaoru‚Ä¶ Are ya really‚Ä¶

[Kiryu enters.]

Kiryu: How‚Äôs your arm?

Kaoru: It‚Äôs fine now.

Kiryu: Could I trouble you for some water?

[Tamiyo nods and leaves. Kaoru‚Äôs phone ringing.]

Kaoru: This is Sayama. Ah, yes. A minor injury, yes. Yeah, he‚Äôs here. Hm? Y-Yeah, sure. (to Kiryu) Chief wants to talk to you‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Huh? This is Kiryu.

Tsutomu: This is Bessho, Division Four. Did Sayama fill ya in on the investigation?

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ But what do you want with me?

Tsutomu: Hope you‚Äôre sittin‚Äô down. Yer buddy and Chairman Goda have been kidnapped by some gang.

Kiryu: What‚Äôd you say?

Tsutomu: They ran off in a blaze of machine gun fire when we chased ‚Äôem.

Kiryu: Was it the Go-Ryu Clan?

Tsutomu: Nope, they were speakin‚Äô a foreign language. Any other guesses?

Kiryu: No‚Ä¶

Tsutomu: Well, what can ya do. Figured I‚Äôd throw it out there. I‚Äôm thinkin‚Äô y‚Äôoughta book it back to Kamurocho, y‚Äôknow?

Kiryu: Go back to Kamurocho? But‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt leave Daigo and Chairman Goda like this.

Tsutomu: Well, the plates on the getaway cars had Kamurocho numbers.

Kiryu: What!?

Kiryu: That‚Äôs all I can give ya. Protocol, y‚Äôknow.

Kiryu: Right. I owe you one.

Tsutomu: Yeah? Remember, Sayama and Osaka PD have ya by the short n‚Äô curlies.

Kiryu: I‚Äôll remember.

Tsutomu: Later.

[He hungs up.]

Kiryu: I‚Äôm going back to Kamurocho.

Kaoru: What?

Kiryu: That‚Äôs outside Osakan jurisdiction. You don‚Äôt have to come.

Kaoru: The second they put you in my custody, jurisdiction went out the window. I‚Äôm going with you.

Kiryu: Have it your way.

Chapter 5: HIDDEN PAST
[Kiryu and Kaoru return to Kamurocho. The sign above their heads with Á•ûÂÆ§Áî∫Â§©‰∏ã‰∏ÄÈÄö„Çä means ‚ÄúKamurocho Tenkaichi Street‚Äù. Kaoru gets sick and falls down. Kiryu catches her.]

Kiryu: What‚Äôs wrong?

Kaoru: I‚Äôm fine. Just a little light-headed‚Ä¶

Kiryu: (touches her forehead) I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre still running a fever.

Kaoru: And I said I‚Äôm fine. Drop it! Put me down! This is embarrassing!

Kiryu: You‚Äôll live. We‚Äôre not going far anyway.

[He brings her to some long abandoned place‚Ä¶]

Kaoru: Where are we?

Kiryu: Just a bar I used to unwind at.

Kaoru: Oh.

Kiryu: You shouldn‚Äôt be pushing yourself so hard yet.

Kaoru: I‚Äôll be fine after a little rest.

Kiryu: (turns on the light) The place is closed up, but the lights still work‚Ä¶ Yeah, glad to hear your voice, Kashiwagi-san.

[Ironically, as he speaks, Kashiwagi calls him.]

Kashiwagi: This is Kashiwagi. Kiryu, are you all right?

Kiryu: Yeah, glad to hear your voice, Kashiwagi-san.

Kashiwagi: Where are you now?

Kiryu: I just got back to Kamurocho.

Kashiwagi: I‚Äôm getting some crazy reports out of Kansai. What the hell happened down there?

Kiryu: Chairman Goda and Daigo were abducted. And I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs behind it yet. I‚Äôll head down to Tojo HQ to fill you in.

Kashiwagi: Good plan. I‚Äôll round up the officers. They‚Äôll want to hear this.

Kiryu: (Guess it‚Äôs time to catch a cab.)

[On the way to cabs Kiryu got a call.]

Kiryu: This is Kiryu.

Daigo: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs Daigo.

Kiryu: Daigo! Are you all right!?

Daigo: Yeah, I‚Äôm‚Äî

Unknown voice: Is this Kazuma Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Who the hell are you!?

Unknown voice: You‚Äôll find out soon enough. If you want Daigo Dojima to live‚Ä¶ Meet me at 1 A.M. tomorrow night at the Amano Building.

Kiryu: The Amano Building? What about Chairman Goda? Is he alive?

Unknown voice: You‚Äôll find out soon enough. Oh, and be sure to come alone.

Kiryu: Fine.

Unknown voice: See you.

(Tomorrow, 1 A.M., the Amano Building‚Ä¶ The Tojo Clan officers will want to hear this. I better catch a cab.)

Taxi Driver: The base fare is 660 yen. Where would you like to go? Very well. Let‚Äôs be on our way.

[Kiryu arrives at Tojo HQ meeting.]

Kashiwagi: The Go-Ryu Clan staged a coup!?

Kiryu: Ryuji Goda‚Ä¶ He wants an all-out war between Kansai and Kanto at any cost.

Kashiwagi: Then have you figured out who the foreigners behind the kidnapping are?

Kiryu: Not yet‚Ä¶

Yayoi: And the man who took Daigo told you to come to the Amano Building alone at 1:00 tonight?

Kiryu: Right.

Yayoi: This is a trap.

Kiryu: I know. But if I don‚Äôt go, we‚Äôll never know who we‚Äôre dealing with here.

Yayoi: Maybe so, but still‚Ä¶

Kashiwagi: You think the foreigners are tied to the Go-Ryu Clan behind the scenes?

Kiryu: No doubt they are. I can‚Äôt think of anyone else who would take Daigo and Chairman Goda.

Kashiwagi: It‚Äôs probably the same foreign group responsible for bombing my office‚Ä¶

Yayoi: If so, they know their way around Kamurocho. Which means going in alone is even more dangerous. Shindo! The Amano Building is your territory, right? Give Kiryu some backup here. Keep your distance, but be ready.

Shindo: I don‚Äôt think so.

[KOJI SHINDO. Patriarch of the Nishikiyama Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

Kashiwagi: (stands from his chair) What was that!?

Shindo: My boys are still sore from what Kiryu here did to the family. Considering that‚Ä¶

Kashiwagi: You little shit! That‚Äôs because Nishikiyama was a traitor!

Shindo: I‚Äôm well aware of that. But our respect for Patriarch Nishikiyama led us to this life. And that respect for the boss‚Ä¶ hasn‚Äôt changed.

Yayoi: Then you‚Äôre openly defying clan orders?

Shindo: Even if it means expulsion from the Tojo Clan, that‚Äôs the one‚Äî

Kiryu: Fine then. I know better than anyone what sort of man Nishiki was. And I understand the sentiment. But‚Ä¶ Let me ask you just one thing.

Shindo: And that is?

Kiryu: Other than your grudge against me‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not hiding any other objections to this, are you?

Shindo: Of course not.

Kiryu: All right‚Ä¶ Then it‚Äôs settled.

Shindo: If you‚Äôll excuse me.

[He bows and leaves the room. Some time later Kiryu talks with Yayoi in private.]

Yayoi: Kiryu, I have something personal I‚Äôd like to discuss with you. Can you meet me on the first floor?

Kashiwagi: If you‚Äôre sure, I‚Äôd suggest trying Purgatory, then.

Kiryu: He hangs out there?

Kashiwagi: In a manner of speaking, yes. But things have changed since last year. Better that you see for yourself. The entrance is still through that public bathroom near West Park. I never understood it, but it makes about as much sense as Purgatory does. Be careful.

Kiryu: I‚Äôll do my best.

Go to Purgatory
[He exits the Tojo building and sees a frightened worker talking to the guards.]

Man: I got a dispatch from the company saying there‚Äôs a gas leak on the premises. I‚Äôll need to get through here‚Ä¶

Tojo Clan Member 1: Well nothing‚Äôs come down to me, so I suggest you turn around!

Man: But if I ignore it I‚Äôm gonna lose my job‚Ä¶

Tojo Clan Member 2: What!? You dumb bastard, listen, we‚Äôre‚Äî

Man: Fine! You leave me no choice‚Ä¶!

[He punches Tojo Clan Member 1.]

Tojo Clan Member 1: Gergh! What the fuck are you doing!?

Tojo Clan Member 2: Hey, are you okay!?

Tojo Clan Member 1: Damn‚Ä¶ I knew he seemed fishy!

[Kiryu runs in.]

Kiryu: (Some kind of hitman? He‚Äôs not making it past me!)

[Kiryu and the two Tojo Clan Members punches the stupidest assassin to the ground.]

Kiryu: (He must have been sent by the Omi Alliance‚Ä¶)

Tojo Clan Member 1: Who the fuck was he!? Not that it matters, I‚Äôm about to beat it out of him!

Tojo Clan Member 2: (bows) Thanks for your help, Fourth Chairman.

Kiryu: It‚Äôs fine. The Tojo Clan is going to be assaulted from every angle now, so you‚Äôve gotta stay sharp. Keep security tight, too.

Tojo Clan Member 1: Yes, sir!

Kiryu: (I should get back to Kamurocho now.)

[When Kiryu arrives in Kamurocho by cab, Kaoru calls him.]

Kiryu: Sayama? What‚Äôs up?

Kaoru: What‚Äôs up!? Oh, I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs up‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt really get the position you‚Äôre in, do you? Disappear like that again, and I‚Äôll‚Äî

Kiryu: You were unconscious. Was I supposed to watch you sleep?

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶Whatever. Let‚Äôs just say you‚Äôve used your get outta jail free card. Anyway, where are you?

Kaoru: Out in Kamurocho.

Kaoru: Oh, perfect. Can you do me a favor?

Kiryu: I guess?

Kaoru: Can you pick up a few things for me?

Kiryu: You want me to shop for you?

Kaoru: Listen, let‚Äôs not make this any more awkward than it has to be. I need some underwear.

Kiryu: W-Wait, what? Is this a joke?

Kaoru: Look, I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd be staying in Kamurocho like this.

Kiryu: You were the one that came along‚Ä¶

Kaoru: And while you‚Äôre out, I could really use a beer.

Kiryu: Seriously‚Ä¶?

Kaoru: Underwear and beer! It‚Äôs two things! Can you manage that?

Kiryu: Listen. I‚Äôm not your personal‚Äî

Kaoru: Oh, sorry, what? You‚Äôre breaking up! Thanks, see ya soon!

[Kiryu buys what Kaoru asked for and returns to his old bar.]

Kiryu: Hello? Where are you? Where‚Äôd she go?

[Kaoru walks out of the shower. She‚Äôs wrapped in a towel.]

Kaoru: Ah, that felt good. I was so sweaty and gross, I figured I‚Äôd hit a sauna or something‚Ä¶ But the place next door had a shower, so I just helped myself.

Kiryu: (turns around) So I see.

Kaoru: I‚Äôm guessing the place used to be a brothel? I‚Äôve never seen so many showers all crammed together like that. In Kansai, we‚Äôd have busted them in a heartbeat.

Kiryu: Are you feeling better then?

Kaoru: Yeah, my fever finally broke. My shoulder‚Äôs almost good as new too. I feel like I‚Äôm ready for action again.

[Kaoru drops the towel.]

Kiryu: Yeah, well‚Ä¶ You should still take it easy.

Kaoru: Thanks for picking stuff up.

[Kiryu lights a cigarette.]

Kiryu: Hey‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Hm?

Kiryu: I know you only followed me here to dig up some Tojo Clan history.

Kaoru: (in Kiryu‚Äôs memory) With him in my custody, I can get closer to the Tojo Clan. Whatever happened‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll finally be close enough to dig it up.

Kiryu: I didn‚Äôt mean to eavesdrop.

[Kaoru opens a can of beer and has a few sips.]

Kaoru: If you knew that‚Ä¶ Why‚Äôd you let me follow you to Kamurocho?

Kiryu: Because it‚Äôs a Tojo Clan issue.

Kaoru: And you‚Äôre curious?

Kiryu: A little. Will you tell me?

Kaoru: It‚Äôs just like Mama said‚Ä¶ I grew up without knowing my real parents. I was told they got sick and passed when I still a baby‚Ä¶ But I could tell Mama was hiding something. Then one day I heard Mama shouting on the phone.

Kiryu: What‚Äôd you overhear?

Kaoru: "The Tojo Clan‚Äôs what made Kaoru‚Äôs life a livin‚Äô hell."

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan‚Äôs responsible?

Kaoru: I‚Äôm sure she was talking to someone who knows my past. That was 10 years back. I‚Äôve asked her a thousand times, but she‚Äôll never tell me. She‚Äôd always just say. "Knowing won‚Äôt make you any happier."

Kiryu: You‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs not a misunderstanding?

Kaoru: I can read Mama like a book‚Ä¶ And she‚Äôs hiding something. But it was killing me to keep hounding her. So I joined the force hoping to find out for myself.

Kiryu: You think the Tojo Clan killed your parents?

Kaoru: After all these secrets, isn‚Äôt that the natural conclusion?

Kiryu: Now it‚Äôs making sense. You used "protective custody" as a cover to get close to me‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Some cop I am if you can read me that easy, huh?

Kiryu: It‚Äôs not like I can‚Äôt sympathize.

Kaoru: Huh?

Kiryu: I had one too‚Ä¶ A secret, I mean.

Kaoru: Something in your past?

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ But when I learned the truth, it only brought me pain. I still wish I‚Äôd never found out. Isn‚Äôt it possible‚Ä¶ that some secrets are better off kept that way?

Kaoru: Spoken like a man who knows his past.

Kiryu: I guess that‚Äôs fair.

[Some time later.]

Kiryu: Hey, I‚Äôve got somewhere I need to go.

Kaoru: Oh yeah? Where?

Kiryu: The place is called Purgatory.

Kaoru: Purgatory? Sounds cheery. Where is it?

Kiryu: Well, the entrance is disguised as a bathroom near a park.

Kaoru: Really‚Ä¶ And just what are we gonna find in this ‚ÄúPurgatory?‚Äù

Kiryu: It‚Äôs a little corner of the underworld. You never really know.

Kaoru: I‚Äôm not sure I follow, but I‚Äôm coming all the same. Let‚Äôs move.

Go to Purgatory
[They go to the bathroom near the park. A man meets them there.]

Tamura: Oh, Kiryu-san! It‚Äôs been forever!

Kiryu: Hey, Tamura. How goes the info business? Haven‚Äôt talked to you in a while.

Tamura: Yeah, same old, same old! What have you been up to, though? I haven‚Äôt seen you around.

Kiryu: Yeah, I don‚Äôt live here anymore.

Tamura: That would explain it. Well, if you ever need info, you know I‚Äôm your man. I‚Äôll cut you a good deal. I still hang around the theater if you need me. Hope to see you around!

[Kiryu enters the bathroom. Kaoru looks a bit worried.]

Kaoru: Hold up! This is a men‚Äôs room‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt see anything. Stay close, now.

[Kiryu enters the booth.]

Kaoru: This is the place?

Kiryu: I was just as surprised the first time.

[When they enter the Purgatory itself, Kiryu notices that construction is going on everywhere. A rather dirty park with tents of homeless people is being transformed into a well-kept residential area.]

Kiryu: This was a different place a year back.

Kaoru: What was it like before?

Kiryu: It was a homeless encampment.

Kaoru: Looks like they‚Äôre renovating.

Kiryu: Yeah.

[A muscular black guy approaches Kiryu. If I remember correctly his name is Gary "Buster" Holmes and he was one of underworld fighters. He‚Äôs a construction worker now.]

Gary: It has been a long time, Kiryu-san. Boss is waiting in the back downstairs. Go ahead.

[Kiryu and Kaoru enter the underground city of sin. It doesn‚Äôt change much since the previous game - it‚Äôs still a traditional Japanese Red Light District.]

Hooker: Come play with me!

Kaoru: There‚Äôs a whole city under here‚Ä¶

Kiryu: You haven‚Äôt seen anything yet.

Kaoru: What IS this place!?

Kiryu: Probably better not to ask questions. Just follow me, would you?

[They go to The Florist Palace at the end of the street.]

Gate Guard: Well, well, well! If it isn‚Äôt Kiryu-san! And your lady fried here is your‚Ä¶?

Kaoru: His what?

Gate Guard: ‚Ä¶Nothing! Perish the thought!

Kiryu: I‚Äôve got some business inside‚Ä¶

Gate Guard: Of course! You‚Äôre welcome any time, sir.

[Kiryu opens the door and enters. He is holding a tanto with red flowers on the handle.]

Kiryu: It‚Äôs Kiryu. Anybody home? I know you‚Äôre here‚Ä¶ Show yourself.

[He sticks the tanto in the floor. Mad laughter comes from somewhere.]

Majima: It‚Äôs been too long‚Ä¶ Kiryu-chan! You got any idea how lonely I‚Äôve been since ya got outta the game last year? Oh, but I knew my Kiryu-chan would come home sooner or later!

[GORO MAJIMA. President of Majima Construction.]

Kaoru: Who or what is he?

Kiryu: Former captain of the Tojo Clan‚Äôs Shimano Family‚Ä¶ He was my aniki once. He had a hand in last year‚Äôs incident, too. It‚Äôs been awhile, Majima-san.

Majima: The hell, Kiryu-chan. Ya already got a lady? What a player!

Kiryu: Don‚Äôt get the wrong idea.

Majima: Aww, no need to be shy ‚Äôbout it! Right, babe?

Kaoru: Osaka PD Division Four‚Äôs Kaoru Sayama. ‚Ä¶Charmed.

Majima: Osaka PD? Division Four? You‚Äôre a copper, sweetheart? Kiryu-chan, what the fuck?

Kiryu: Moving on‚Ä¶ Why are you even down here?

Majima: ‚ÄòCause the last guy gave up his digs.

Kiryu: The Florist left?

Kaoru: Florist‚Ä¶?

Kiryu: Yeah, he‚Äôs this legendary information dealer who ran the operation here a year ago.

Majima: Yup. "The Florist of Sai" they call him. The guy‚Äôs an ex-cop. Used to deliver info on bouquet cards, so the name followed.

Kiryu: Where is he now, then?

Majima: Went back to the sunny side.

Kiryu: Sunny side?

Majima: He‚Äôs subcontractin‚Äô to the cops. All the cameras in Kamurocho work for them now. Well, far as the Florist is concerned, I guess it‚Äôs just new place, same ol‚Äô shit, eh?

Kiryu: So he‚Äôs back on police payroll?

Majima: Yup. And when he left, this place turned into a ghost town. So I figured I‚Äôd start up Majima Construction and get to work on Kamurocho Hills!

Kiryu: Kamurocho Hills?

Majima: Didn‚Äôt ya see it up there? That huge-ass steel skeleton? That‚Äôs Kamurocho Hills, buddy! Course, I‚Äôm only in it ‚Äôcause this little underground city was part of the package‚Ä¶

Kiryu: You never cease to amaze.

Majima: Right!? So‚Ä¶ What brings ya here?

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan‚Ä¶ needs you.

Majima: For fuck‚Äôs sake. What‚Äôs this‚Äô BS now!? You‚Äôre a shitty comedian, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: I‚Äôm serious. The Tojo Clan has never needed you more than now. Please.

Majima: No fuckin‚Äô way.

Kiryu: (bows) Please‚Ä¶

Majima: You‚Äôre killin‚Äô me, Kiryu-chan! I can‚Äôt stand seein‚Äô ya like this! Please, Majima-san‚Ä¶

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan is as good as dead without the Majima Family. Please! If that‚Äôs how ya want it‚Ä¶

Majima: Only on one condition, though.

Kiryu: What is it?

Majima: A little thing only you can do, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: Seriously‚Ä¶?

Majima: Oh yeah. A tournament. So? You in?

Kaoru: Tournament? What does he mean?

Kiryu: This won‚Äôt take long. I‚Äôll meet you back at Serena.

[Kaoru leaves.]

Kiryu: So, where‚Äôd the Florist go?

Majima: He‚Äôs up in the Millennium Tower.

Kiryu: What?

Majima: 50th floor, last I heard. Guy gets stuck underground long enough, I guess he starts yearnin‚Äô for the sky.

Kiryu: Maybe so‚Ä¶

Majima: Anyway, are ya ready for a good ol‚Äô fashioned beating? Hit me when you‚Äôre ready, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: (Maybe I should check in with Komaki before I tackle this tournament.)

Majima: Ya ready, Kiryu-chan?

Just a second.
Tell me the rules first. +
I‚Äôm all set.

Kiryu: I want to know what this tournament‚Äôs about before I do this.

Majima: Oh, ya wouldn‚Äôt be gettin‚Äô cold feet now, would ya? Well‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs gonna be you up against three of my best, one after another. That‚Äôs all it is. Just you and my boys, makin‚Äô a bloody mess of each other. Pretty fun, right, Kiryu-chan?

Kiryu: Well, at least I get it now.

Feel the Heat! (sub story)
[He finds Komeki in some filthy alley, sleeping in a tent. It seems the old master is not doing very well.]

Old Man: Oho, my prized pupil! So you have chosen to grace me with your presence!

Kiryu: Hey there, old man. Long time no see.

Old Man: I‚Äôd heard whispers of a dragon rematerializing in the unkempt streets of Kamurocho, and I am pleased to find they were true. I, Sotaro Komaki, shall train you anew.

Kiryu: You haven‚Äôt changed at all, old man. Sounds like you‚Äôre still pretty active, too.

Komaki: Ohoho! I may be advancing in age, but my strength shall endure as a mighty river through a verdant mountain! Some rapscallions in white jerseys learned that lesson the hard way when they sought to challenge me for ownership of this lot.

Kiryu: White jerseys? Sounds familiar.

Komaki: They are no more, regardless. Now I can dedicate my entire strength to training pupils such as you. Having said that, we have already trained extensively. So, let us first ensure you have not rusted like a blade in the beating rain. Show me your strength, my pupil.

Kiryu: You just want me to attack you?

Komaki: Hm? No! I want you to focus your energy in combat, and let that power envelop you. Doing so will draw out the full extent of your strength and elevate your consciousness to a higher state of being. I call this state‚Ä¶ Extreme Heat Mode.

Kiryu: Sounds pretty extreme.

Komaki: You will grow accustomed to it in time. Soon, this power shall rise from within you as effortlessly as the sun at dawn. Now, to activate Extreme Heat Mode, press R2 when you have a full Heat Gauge. If your Heat Gauge runs dry, simply attack enemies to fill it. Well then, I believe it is time for you to prove your mettle.

[Three thugs appear before Kiryu.]

Komaki: This rabble should be adequate subjects for your newly learned ability. Are you ready, my pupil?

Kiryu: I think so. I just have to press R2 with a full Heat Gauge. Right?

Komaki: Oho, right you are! You are actually listening! Now then‚Ä¶ Begin!

[Kiryu defeats his opponents using Extreme Heat Mode.]

Komaki: Incredible, my disciple. Truly incredible.

Kiryu: So that‚Äôs what you meant by drawing out all of my strength‚Ä¶

Komaki: Remember that feeling well. It will prove invaluable the next time you are besieged by hooligans. I shall have another lesson for you in the near future. Now get out there and continue your training!

Kiryu: Will do. Thanks, old man.

[Kiryu returns to Majima.]

Majima: Ya ready, Kiryu-chan?

Just a second.
Tell me the rules first.
I‚Äôm all set. +

Kiryu: Yeah, I‚Äôm all set.

Majima: Hell yeah! Let‚Äôs get this started, then!

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen! At long last, the Dragon of Dojima returns to the ring! He endured a decade of unjust jail time, only to save the city and become a legend! Last year‚Äôs underground king of the ring, Kazuma Kiryu! Facing him, a rising star of the cage! The Brazilian Juggernaut‚Ä¶ Robison Caetano di Sciuva! So, after a year‚Äôs absence, the champion returns to the ring! Who will victory smile upon tonight!? Now, the gong!

[Kiryu defeats a strange guy in a pelt and with an axe.]

Announcer: Winner! Kazuma Kiryu! The champion remains a legend! But! Our next challenger is yet another lost legend of the cage! The king of the ring dethroned last year, Gary Buster Holmes!

Gary: Some coincidence, huh, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Gary: Sudden death or Asian youth‚Ä¶ Which you want?

Kiryu: I see your Japanese still sucks.

Announcer: Legendary yakuza versus legendary fallen king! An epic battle sounds the gong!

[Kiryu defeats the muscular black guy.]

Announcer: Kiryu‚Äôs a beast! He‚Äôs unstoppable! A complete domination over the fallen king! Here we are at the final round‚Ä¶ Time for the big man himself to make his entrance! Give it up for our reigning tournament champion‚Ä¶ Goro Majima.

[Majima is as extravagant as usual. He dances with his tanto in his hands in sparks from fireworks.]

Announcer: In his six months since appearing in the ring‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶The Mad Dog of Shimano has yet to taste defeat! Look at that chilling chiurance! Half performance art, half raw power! Is kiryu the man to take him down? And now, he enters the ring!

Majima: Whaddya think, Kiryu-chan!? Ain‚Äôt I red hot!?

Kiryu: You always were the one guy I couldn‚Äôt read.

Majima: Well, let‚Äôs do this shit. I‚Äôll keep it fair n‚Äô square!

Announcer: Now, the gong!

[Kiryu fights his sworn best friend and wins.]

Majima: That‚Äôs the Kiryu-chan I know‚Ä¶ Still a goddamn tough customer‚Ä¶

Kiryu: You promised me‚Ä¶ Come back to the Tojo Clan.

Majima: Right, let‚Äôs hash this shit out over a drink.

[Kiryu runs to The Florist Palace to drink with Majima.]

Majima: Nice moves out there‚Ä¶ Glad ya still got it, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: I did what you asked. Are you going to hold up your end?

Majima: Yeah, yeah. A promise is a promise. Ya really want me back in the Tojo Clan?

Kiryu: No‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt need to rejoin them.

Majima: Eh? You changin‚Äô the terms on me, Kiryu-chan? That ain‚Äôt what ya said earlier.

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan can‚Äôt handle you. You‚Äôre way more than they could hope to chew. So I just want you to give them a hand. They need your strength now.

Majima: Oh, so ya want me to give ‚Äôem a little juice is all?

Kiryu: Basically. Think you can do that form

Majima: Fine. Only ‚Äôcause it‚Äôs you, Kiryu-chan. But I gotta ask‚Ä¶ Is the Tojo Clan really so fucked that you‚Äôd call me in?

Kiryu: Shindo is threatening to split the Nishikiyama Family off from the clan.

Majima: That‚Äôd be what, half the Tojo‚Äôs men?

Kiryu: More or less. And with the Go-Ryu Clan bearing down on the city, the timing‚Äôs terrible.

Majima: Yeah? Well this is all settin‚Äô off my stank detector, Kiryu-chan. It don‚Äôt feel right.

Kiryu: Why do you say that?

Majima: Can‚Äôt help but feel like someone‚Äôs pullin‚Äô your string.

Kiryu: How so?

Majima: Well, the Omi capped Terada, yeah? Let‚Äôs start there.

Kiryu: Yeah. Right in front of me.

Majima: That‚Äôs some iffy shit.

Kiryu: Iffy? Seems pretty clear cut to me, but let‚Äôs hear it.

Majima: When Terada took the reins, the Omi actually stopped makin‚Äô trouble for the Tojo Clan. We were makin‚Äô trouble for them.

Kiryu: Really? Then the attack is what‚Äôs strange to you?

Majima: Hey, if it was a Go-Ryu power play, maybe it‚Äôs legit. That crazy fuck‚Äôll kill ya then steal your pants. But Terada didn‚Äôt make enough waves to warrant a hit.

Kiryu: But if it would weaken the clan‚Ä¶ they wouldn‚Äôt take the opportunity?

Majima: Hey, I been outta the game a while now. Can‚Äôt say I know all the fine print. All I‚Äôm sayin‚Äô is I never liked the guy.

Kiryu: Why not?

Majima: He was always givin‚Äô us that weak shit about "peace n‚Äô coexistence.‚Äù And now look, everyone thinks the Tojo Clan‚Äôs lost its sack. ‚ÄòSides‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Besides what?

Majima: Terada left the whole clan scramblin‚Äô around like this‚Ä¶ Just goes to show he never had his shit together.

Kiryu: Then‚Ä¶ You didn‚Äôt trust Terada?

Majima: Naw. That man wasn‚Äôt the kinda yakuza fools thought he was.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Majima: Terada surrounded himself with nothin‚Äô but head-bobbin yes-men. The old guard like me n‚Äô Kashiwagi got sidelined soon as he took over.

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san too?

Majima: Yeah. Acting clan captain my ass. He was an ornament. Gave him a cushy office in the Millennium Tower, but he still couldn‚Äôt do shit without Terada‚Äôs nod. I got tired of the Terada drama‚Ä¶ So I bailed.

Kiryu: Hard to believe that‚Äôs the man Terada really was‚Ä¶

Majima: Eh, can‚Äôt fault ya for not bein‚Äô a mind-reader. But Kiryu-chan‚Ä¶ Ain‚Äôt nothin‚Äô wrong with trustin‚Äô a guy, but ya gotta be careful‚Ä¶

[The alarm goes on.]

Majima: Tch‚Ä¶ This shit again? Some fools don‚Äôt know when to quit!

Kiryu: What‚Äôs this alarm for?

Majima: It‚Äôs the intruder alarm for the build site. They‚Äôre a pain in my ass lately.

Kiryu: Who‚Äôs invading your site?

Majima: Just some fuckwads tryin‚Äô to steal our Kamurocho Hills plans.

Kiryu: They‚Äôre after your Hills plan‚Ä¶?

Majima‚Äôs Worker: Boss! Bad news! It‚Äôs them again! What do we do?

Majima: C‚Äômon‚Ä¶ Show ‚Äôem to the door, that‚Äôs what! We gotta get wild again. Form up!

Majima‚Äôs Worker: R-Right!

[The worker runs away.]

Majima: Attackin‚Äô us like this all the damn time‚Ä¶ They‚Äôve sure got balls!

[Majima and his men goes on the street. There‚Äôs a group of men waiting for them.]

Majima: Huh‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs a lotta dudes. They finally takin‚Äô this seriously?

Kiryu: So, what now? Against that many‚Ä¶ You have a game plan?

Majima: You‚Äôre damn right I do! Punch ‚Äôem all dead! Right, Nishida!?

Nishida: R-Right!

Kiryu: Okay‚Ä¶ Then count me in.

Majima: You, Kiryu-chan?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Nishida: Nice! Kiryu-san‚Äôs worth at least a hundred guys! That‚Äôs cool, right boss!?

Majima: Nope. He can‚Äôt.

Nishida: Wha!?

Majima: This fight‚Äôs ours to deal with. Kiryu-chan ain‚Äôt got a stake in our business.

Nishida: Y-Yeah, but‚Ä¶

Majima: Zip it! If I say he stays outta our business, he stays the hell out! Or are ya sayin‚Äô we won‚Äôt win without his help. That what yer gettin‚Äô at!? Huh!?

Nishida: N-No, that‚Äôs not what I meant!

Kiryu: I can see your point here. But all the same‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm helping you.

Majima: Eh? And why‚Äôs that?

Kiryu: Didn‚Äôt you just promise to help me out because I‚Äôve got trouble on my end? So tell me‚Ä¶ Why wouldn‚Äôt I extend the same courtesy to you? You manned up, and here‚Äôs my answer. So too bad, because it‚Äôs personal now. That‚Äôs just the kinda guy I am‚Ä¶ And you know full well, right?

Majima: Heh, so be it. Fine! Kiryu-chan gets to lend a hand without even raisin‚Äô one.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Majima: Kiryu-chan‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre gonna be the foreman!

Kiryu: The foreman‚Ä¶?

Majima: Yup! The foreman! Majima Japan‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Foreman Kiryu!

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶.You‚Äôre kinda losing me here.

Majima: Y‚Äôsee, they ain‚Äôt here to kick our asses‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre here to wreck our shit!

Kiryu: Your equipment?

Majima: Yeah! They‚Äôre tryin‚Äô to destroy our stuff, cause a setback on the Hills plan, and then swoop in on the deal.

Kiryu: I see now‚Ä¶ Then we need to toss them out while protecting your equipment.

Majima: That‚Äôs exactly it. But y‚Äôsee‚Ä¶ We ain‚Äôt so hot on defense‚Ä¶ We get so caught up cavin‚Äô faces in, we kinda forget about the gear‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why I want ya to take a top view and give orders to protect the gear while we wreck shop.

Kiryu: I can see that, but‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs not exactly my forte‚Ä¶

Majima: Weren‚Äôt ya gonna man the fuck up? Um countin‚Äô on ya here! It‚Äôs the foreman‚Äôs job!

Kiryu: Heh‚Ä¶ You got it.

Nishida: Boss! They‚Äôre about to strike!

Majima: Good shit! Let‚Äôs do this, Kiryu-chan!

Kiryu: Yeah!

Majima: Majima Construction‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs get to work!

[Kiryu helps defend Majima‚Äôs equipment in unique tower defense style gameplay.]

Majima: You guys did great. We mopped ‚Äôem all up, I think. Not too shabby, Foreman Kiryu. Ya got a real knack for this.

Kiryu: I won‚Äôt lie, that was hard‚Ä¶

[Two guys dressed like cyberpunk pimps approaches.]

Man: Bravo! Man, Majima Construction is one fine company. Eh? Who‚Äôre you? A new hire or something?

Kiryu: It‚Äôs Kiryu. And who might you be?

Man: Whoops! My bad, guy. Name‚Äôs Keiji Mutoh, CEO of Mutoh Realty.

[KEIJI MUTOH. CEO of Mutoh Realty.]

Kiryu: Mutoh Realty‚Ä¶

Keiji: Yeah, we‚Äôre a pretty big firm ‚Äôround these parts. I keep asking Majima-san here to give us the Hills plan, but he‚Äôs playin‚Äô hardball.

Kiryu: That means you guys are‚Ä¶

Majima: Yeah, the ass rats we‚Äôve been beatin‚Äô back.

Keiji: You‚Äôre so stubborn, Majima-san! He won‚Äôt give the go no matter how much cash we flash

Majima: I don‚Äôt got a single hill in these plans for guys like you.

Keiji: Oh yeah? Well then I guess taking them by force is all we‚Äôve got left. Right, Chono?

Chono: Yeah‚Ä¶

[MASAHIRO CHONO. Leader of the Color Gang.]

Keiji: This‚Äôs my partner, Chono. He‚Äôs the head of the color gangs in these parts.

Chono: It‚Äôs gonna be a pleasure, Majima-san and‚Ä¶ Kiryu-san, was it? Figured my boys would be able to take down a simple construction company‚Ä¶ But I guess not. You guys are the real deal. Why you gwastin‚Äô away as civilians?

Keiji: Yeah‚Ä¶ Hey, want me to introduce ya to my yakuza buds? Feel like a career change?

Kiryu: No thanks, I‚Äôm good.

Keiji: Suit yourself. Anyway, I just wanted to say hi. Wanna head out?

Chono: Yeah. With this guy helpin‚Äô out‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll need to step our game up.

Keiji: Step it up, huh? Think we should get the Three Musketeers involved? Not sure that‚Äôs wise,

Kiryu: Three Musketeers‚Ä¶?

Chono: The Three Musketeers land sharks‚Ä¶ Ever heard of ‚Äôem?

Majima: Hmph. Not ringin‚Äô any bells here.

Chono: Hm. As a construction company president, you probably oughta study up. Well, you‚Äôll meet ‚Äôem soon enough. It‚Äôll be good times.

Keiji: Let‚Äôs roll, Chono. I‚Äôm starving.

Chono: Right.

Keiji: Hey, Majima Construction!

Majima: Eh?

Keiji: Playtime‚Äôs over. I‚Äôm goin‚Äô all out next time.

Kiryu: Hm. Can‚Äôt wait.

Majima: We won‚Äôt hold back either. Three Musketeers or not, we‚Äôll smoke the lot of ya.

Keiji: Haha! The Hills plan is a cash cow‚Ä¶ Too much steak for you to handle! Better get ready.

Chono: I‚Äôll crush the lot of you! Just you wait!

[They leave.]

Majima: This is my bad, Kiryu-chan. Didn‚Äôt wanna drag ya into this shit show.

Kiryu: You‚Äôve done more for me than this. This is nothing. We can‚Äôt let those guys interfere with the Hills plan. Let‚Äôs break them.

Majima: Heh, damn right. Gotta admit, the prospect of fightin‚Äô alongside Kiryu-chan again is gettin‚Äô me hyped!

Kiryu: Heh.

Majima: Alright! Let‚Äôs build Kamurocho Hills over the pools of their blood! Foreman Kiryu leadin‚Äô Majima Japan‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs officially on!!

[Next scene. Keiji and Chono stand in some luxury hotel room. There‚Äôs three men before them sittin on a couch.]

Chono: I apologize for having to bring you all together today, Three Musketeers.

Man 1: Right, pretty rare to get an invite from you, yeah? Here I was thinking you hated our guts.

[RIKI CHOSHU. CEO of Chosu Production.]

Keiji: How could I hate you three? You‚Äôre all my senpai‚Ä¶ Nothin‚Äô but respect.

Man 2: I don‚Äôt really give a shit. Get to the point .

[GENICHIRO TENRYU. CEO of Tenryu Enterprise.]

Keiji: Tenryu-san‚Ä¶ Still so impatient!

Chono: I asked you here for one reason. We want your help taking the Kamurocho Hills plan.

Tenryu: Kamurocho Hills?

Man 3: Yeah? Sounds fancy‚Ä¶ I can smell the money already.

[TATSUMI FUJINAMI. CEO of Fujinami LTD.]

Choshu: The hell? What‚Äôs this hills crap? There a profit in it?

Fijinami: That‚Äôs the plan to build a commercial district over ol West Park, yeah? That‚Äôs gotta be worth over a bil.

Choshu: Yeah? Nice. Let‚Äôs get those plans then.

Chono: That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting at‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôve got a problem.

Fijinami: A problem?

Tenryu: If Chono and Mutoh are comin‚Äô to us‚Ä¶ It must be some fierce competition‚Ä¶

Chono: Exactly right, Tenryu-san. You nailed it. The Hills plan is contracted to Majima Construction. Its president is Goro Majima‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs a former Tojo Clan officer. Earned his name on the streets, ‚ÄúThe Mad Dog of Shimano.‚Äù

Choshu: Yeah? What‚Äôs a guy like that doin‚Äô running a construction company? Life‚Äôs just full‚Äôa surprises.

Chono: And his right-hand man‚Ä¶ Kazuma Kiryu. Check it out‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs the ex-fourth chairman of the Tojo Clan‚Ä¶ The Dragon of Dojima‚Ä¶ A yakuza legend.

Tenryu: Kiryu‚Ä¶?

Fijinami: What‚Äôs up, Tenryu?

Tenryu: Nah, it‚Äôs nothing.

Choshu: In other words, you can‚Äôt handle Kiryu and Majima, so you‚Äôre calling in the specialists.

Keiji: Right on the mark, Choshu-san! You got it. We need ya to knock ‚Äôem out and take that Kamurocho Hills plan. The Hills are money‚Ä¶ Name a price, and it‚Äôs yours. That sound agreeable?

Fijinami: I‚Äôm in. Long as the cash is good, no job‚Äôs too small. That‚Äôs how I roll. And this Dragon of Dojima dude? Gotta say I‚Äôm curious. After all‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a dragon myself. (laughs)

Keiji: Nice, a battle of dragons, huh? Should be exciting‚Ä¶ Ha ha ha‚Ä¶

Chono: What about you, Choshu-san?

Choshu: My jobs have been shit lately. I‚Äôve been lookin‚Äô for something a little meaner. The Dragon of Dojima and the Mad Dog of Shimano‚Ä¶ Sounds like a blast. As the Revolution Warrior‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll show them that reality is a cruel world.

Fijinami: Tenryu‚Ä¶ You in? I heard you‚Äôd gotten outta the game.

Choshu: Really? That true?

Tenryu: Yeah, but if it‚Äôs Kiryu we‚Äôre talking here‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm all the way in.

Chono: Then we‚Äôve got an accord.

Keiji: Right! It‚Äôs all on you, the Three Musketeers land sharks! First guy to bring back the Hills plan gets the whole shebang!

Chono: As for men, you‚Äôve got full rein over my gang of boys. We‚Äôre hoping‚Ä¶ You can win.

Choshu: Eh? Who ya think you‚Äôre talking to? I don‚Äôt botch my jobs.

Fijinami: Better move quick‚Ä¶ Sorry gents, but that payout‚Äôs gonna be mine. Heh heh.

[Tenryu groans.]

Keiji: Huh?

Tenryu: Kazuma Kiryu‚Ä¶

[Back to our hero.]

Kiryu: (I should get back to Serena for now.)

[He gets back to the bar. Kaoru plays with her gun as a worried wife.]

Kaoru: It‚Äôs past midnight, you know. Daigo Dojima‚Äôs expecting you at 1:00, yeah?

[Kiryu lights a cigarette.]

Kaoru: What‚Äôs your deal? You really have time for this?

Kiryu: Hey‚Ä¶ Aren‚Äôt you scared?

Kaoru: Of what?

Kiryu: Of finding out the truth about your past.

Kaoru: What kind of question is that?

Kiryu: Just hear me out. My own parents‚Ä¶ Were murdered by the Tojo Clan.

Kaoru: What?

Kiryu: I learned that last year. The man who killed them‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Was the guy who led me to this life. A man named Shintaro Kazama.

Kaoru: That‚Äôs the secret you mentioned earlier?

Kiryu: I grew up thinking of Kazama-san as my father, so I was able to forgive him in the end. But‚Ä¶ What about you?

Kaoru: If it were me‚Ä¶ If I learn who killed my parents‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll forgive them, no matter who it is. Of course I‚Äôm scared to find out. But it‚Äôs fine. This is the road I‚Äôve chosen.

Kiryu: I see‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Then use me how you can. Stay close, and go hard at the Tojo Clan. If that‚Äôs how you‚Äôll discover your past, I say do it.

Kaoru: You mean that? You were in the Tojo Clan, weren‚Äôt you? How can you say that?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm not proud of my life as a yakuza.

Kaoru: And if you had something to do with it?

Kiryu: Then you point that thing at me, pull the trigger, and don‚Äôt look back. You said you couldn‚Äôt forgive anyone, didn‚Äôt you?

Kaoru: Right‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll do that.

[She stands from her chair.]

Kiryu: Where are you going?

Kaoru: To do my job.

Kiryu: What job?

Kaoru: You‚Äôre in my protective custody. So let‚Äôs move.

Majima Saga - Chapter 1: TOJO CLAN REFORM
February 17th, 2006

[Tojo Clan HQ. Terada, alive and well at the time, enters the meeting room and sits in his chair as the chairman.]

[YUKIO TERADA. Fifth Chairman of the Tojo Clan.]

Patriarch 1: Fifth Chairman! We aren‚Äôt going to stoop to conducting our business like two-bit criminals!

Patriarch 2: The Tojo Clan abides the Tojo Clan‚Äôs code, and no one else‚Äôs! Just because you‚Äôre a former Omi man doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs how we do things here!

Patriarch 1: Exactly! I don‚Äôt know what this Tojo Clan Reformation is about, but we‚Äôre not just money-grubbing thugs like the Omi!

Patriarch 3: All I hear is the cheepin‚Äô and chirpin‚Äô of a buncha whiners!

[AKINOBU UEMATSU. Patriarch of the Uematsu Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

Uematsu: Flappin‚Äô your lips after postin‚Äô up chump change profits‚Ä¶ If ya wanna preen in here‚Ä¶ Do it after ya send up some real revenue, dipshits!

Patriarch 1: The fuck you say? You think being the fifth chairman‚Äôs little pet gives you the right to talk like that!? You‚Äôre just a baby fresh up from some third-rate family! Know your goddamn place!

Patriarch 4: One‚Äôs tenure no longer has any bearing here.

[KEI IBUCHI. Patriarch of the Ibuchi Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

Ibuchi: Those who produce profits are promoted, those who can‚Äôt fall from grace. A blood transfusion based on results and ability‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the basic concept behind the fifth chairman‚Äôs Tojo Clan Reformation Plan. Power is transferred to those who produce results, whether you‚Äôre the old guard or the new blood. Which means‚Ä¶ Since we‚Äôre the ones showing profits, we can talk to you however we see fit.

Patriarch 1: What was that!?

[Every patriarch stands from their couches, offended.]

Terada: I will have order!

[Patriarchs sit down.]

Terada: Shall we proceed? Then I call to order this executive‚Äôs meeting.

Kashiwagi: Fifth Chairman‚Ä¶What is today‚Äôs agenda? Is this the Tojo Clan Reformation again?

Terada: Yes. We‚Äôre picking up where we left off. It‚Äôs time to select who will fill the clan captain‚Äôs empty seat. The clan captain is a position that acts as my right-hand in the Tojo Clan. It‚Äôs a role that has the power to determine the fate of our organization. However, as an outsider myself, this decision is a difficult one to make. Which is why I will select this person through the rules established by my Tojo Clan Reformation project.

Kashiwagi: Rules?

Terada: The Tojo Clan Reformation seeks to elevate those who produce results‚Ä¶ "Results," meaning profits, the group that tithes the highest cut into headquarters‚Ä¶ That family‚Äôs patriarch will become the Tojo Clan‚Äôs next clan captain.

[The patriarchs seem to gladly accept the challenge.]

Terada: That all said‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs look at the total revenues produced by each family for the clan. ‚Ä¶ Ibuchi.

Ibuchi: Yes, sir. Please direct your attention to the screen.

[Families revenue table appears on the screen.]

Patriarch 1: What the hell‚Ä¶

Patriarch 2: No way‚Ä¶ Is the gap really that large?

Ibuchi: As you can see, the Tojo Clan‚Äôs old guard families have more or less the same margins across the board. Well, Kashiwagi-san‚Äôs Kazama Family seems to be making some effort‚Ä¶ Still, even the Kazama Family falls behind two groups who more than double his score. That would be my Ibuchi Family and Uematsu-san‚Äôs Uematsu Family, of course. The very "newcomers" you have so much disdain for, correct? Going by the numbers, Uematsu is clearly first. So it would seem‚Ä¶ Uematsu-san is our next clan captain.

Patriarch 1: Bullshit! You only pull numbers like that because you‚Äôve got your hands in dirty business!

Patriarch 2: In the Tojo Clan, we actually have ethics. Even if the fifth chairman condones this‚Ä¶ I never will!

Patriarch 5: Are you so blinded by profits that you‚Äôve lost the yakuza spirit!?

Uematsu: All you pussies can shut the fuck up! You gripe‚Ä¶ But we‚Äôre the reason you‚Äôve got food on the table! We don‚Äôt work our asses off for charity. It‚Äôs only right that we get ranks fitting our contribution to the clan! If you‚Äôve got a problem with that‚Ä¶ Try makin‚Äô as much as we do!

Ibuchi: It seems there are no further objections. Then our next clan captain is Uematsu-san of the Uematsu Family.

Terada: Mm.

[A sound of laughter and murmuring coming from behind the door of the meeting room.]

Uematsu: Huh?

[Majima enters the room in his usual frantic manner and sits in the captain‚Äôs chair.]

Majima: Don‚Äôt mind if I do!

[GORO MAJIMA. Patriarch of the Majima Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

Uematsu: Hey‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt recall that bein‚Äô your seat.

Majima: Shut up and watch.

[He claps.]

Majima: Roll it in!

[Three of Majima‚Äôs men roll up a cart full of money.]

Patriarch 1: What in the hell is that!? Where‚Äôd he get all that money!?

Ibuchi: Impossible‚Ä¶ How? How‚Äôd you get this much!?

[Majima smiling.]

Majima: See, I‚Äôd been itchin‚Äô to play some baseball‚Ä¶ So I lent some money in exchange for this teeeeeny dirt patch near Kamurocho. Next thing I know, some business swoops in askin‚Äô to buy that land so they can build on it or somethin‚Äô. So I put a crazy-ass price on it, and somehow I ended up with a barrel fulla money. What can I say? Money comes easy when I actually try a little. But oh damn‚Ä¶ If we re going purely off profit, your next clan captain‚Äôs gonna be me of all people! You‚Äôre the fifth chairman, though‚Ä¶ The criteria‚Äôs totally up to you. All I‚Äôm sayin‚Äô is‚Ä¶ Underestimate the Tojo Clan, and its dog‚Äôs gonna bite ya.

Ibuchi: Fifth Chairman‚Ä¶ Your thoughts?

Terada: Let‚Äôs table the issue for now. We‚Äôll revisit the policy at our next executive meeting.

Majima: What gives? This seat‚Äôs just as stiff as the others!

[The meeting is over. Majima leaves the hall and speaks to the patriarchs.]

Toda (Patriarch 2): I don‚Äôt know him well, but I‚Äôm hearing that lbuchi‚Äôs a clever devil. Terada‚Äôs only standing on his own two feet thanks to that kid. I still can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs going on in Terada‚Äôs head, though. I‚Äôll never forgive the fourth chairman for putting us in this mess‚Ä¶

[As Majima approaches the exit he is stopped by Kashiwagi.]

Kashiwagi: Majima‚Ä¶ What are you planning to do after pulling a stunt like that?

Majima: Specifically? Nothin‚Äô. Just gonna keep doin‚Äô my thing.

Kashiwagi: Uematsu‚Äôs not likely to take a slight like that lying down, you know. Be careful, would you?

Majima: Sure.

Yajima (Patriarch 1): The Mad Dog of Shimano strikes again.. Incredible, Majima-san. Ha, I‚Äôm sure you gave Uematsu a lot to think about, eh? I‚Äôm just glad he got his ass handed to him.

Majima: Heh.

[He approaches his car and speaks to the driver.]

Kawamura: Another great day at the office, boss? Nishida-aniki and the others already headed back. I‚Äôm ready to roll if you are, sir.

[They hit the road.]

Kawamura: What do you think‚Äôs gonna happen to the Tojo Clan?

Majima: Ehh?

Kawamura: No it‚Äôs just, all this talk about a Tojo Clan reformation‚Ä¶ Is it really wise to let money be the deciding factor on everything? And those Uematsu-san and Ibuchi-san guys‚Ä¶ Think you can trust them?

Majima: It‚Äôs nothin‚Äô a new kid like you needs to stress about.

Kawamura: Y-You‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ Sorry.

Majima: Doesn‚Äôt matter. Terada‚Äôs the fifth chairman. If he says somethin‚Äôs black, it‚Äôs black. If he says it‚Äôs white, it‚Äôs white. That‚Äôs the world ya sign up for as a yakuza. Long as he trusts ‚Äôem‚Ä¶ So be it. But I say they‚Äôre both shady as fuck. Not a huge fan of either one of ‚Äôem.

Kawamura: I agree‚Ä¶ I think you‚Äôd make a much better clan captain, boss.

Majima: No way in hell I‚Äôm takin‚Äô the captain‚Äôs seat.

Kawamura: Huh? You wouldn‚Äôt?

Majima: Hell no! wouldn‚Äôt last a day with a con man like Terada! Terada probably wants Uematsu, one of his own boys. This Tojo Clan Reformation shit is just an excuse to get his own crew into executive roles.

Kawamura: You‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs rigged?

Majima: Well, pretty much. Yakuza these days beat around the bush too much‚Ä¶ Or maybe I‚Äôm just agin outta this yakuza thing‚Ä¶

Kawamura: No way boss, you‚Äôre too young for that!

Majima: Who the hell are you to say!? Now quit bein‚Äô such a goddamn chatterbox and step on it!

Kawamura: Y-Yes, sir!

[Some time later they pull over.]

Kawamura: I‚Äôll go find a parking spot, boss.

Majima: (May as well head back to the office. The Majima empire ain‚Äôt gonna run itself.)

[He runs down the street, but then he is surrounded by people in black suits.]

Majima: Huh? Who the hell are ya? Ahh, some of Uematsu‚Äôs goons? He works fast, don‚Äôt he? That‚Äôs cool. (pulls out his tanto) Bring it on!

[He kicks their asses.]

Majima: You fools‚Ä¶ You his boys or not!?

Man in black: Heh heh‚Ä¶ Actually‚Ä¶ You oughta be more worried about your own family! (passes out)

Majima: My family? That a threat? | gotta get to the office!

=Go to the Family Office=
[Majima runs to his office. A group of thighs stands in his way.]

Thug: Heh, my boss said he‚Äôd pay me good if I beat the shit out of you! See you in hell, cyclops!

[Majima beats them up and moves along.]

Thug: What‚Äôs the hurry? Hang out with us for a while, old guy!

[Majima cuts them to strips and moves along. He found his men near the office severely injured.]

Majima: What the hell?

Nishida: B‚Ä¶ Boss‚Ä¶

Majima: Nishida‚Ä¶ Who did this?

Nishida: Uematsu‚Ä¶ Family‚Ä¶

Majima: Uematsu‚Ä¶! That guy even know who he‚Äôs fucking with!? Fine‚Ä¶ He wants a war‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs got one! (Uematsu‚Ä¶ Get ready to answer the door, because hell‚Äôs about to come knockin‚Äô!)

=Go to the Uematsu Family Office=
Majima: (The Uematsu office should be somewhere east of Senryo Avenue. If I head there now, I‚Äôll get the jump on his sorry ass!)

[He finds a building with a sign Ê§çÊùæÁµÑ which means ‚ÄúUematsu Family.‚Äù]

Majima: (This is the Uematsu Family office‚Ä¶ Weird, nobody‚Äôs here celebrating that cheap shot on my boys?)

[He enters the building. There‚Äôs blood on the floor. Mjima finds Uematsu‚Ä¶ dead. He was shot in the head.]

Majima: Uematsu‚Ä¶

Chapter 6: SCHEMES
[We go back to the present. The camera flies into the Stardust Club, where Yuya brings Date and Kawara drinks on the second floor.]

Yuya: Feel like it‚Äôs been forever‚Ä¶

Date: Yeah, a whole year flew by.

Yuya: I still owe you for everything, Date-san.

Date: Nah, I should be thanking you for what you did for Saya.

Kawara: Saya?

Date: She‚Äôs my only daughter.

Yuya: How‚Äôs Saya-chan doing?

Date: She‚Äôs at cosmetology school every day, and she‚Äôs loving it.

Yuya: Glad to hear it.

Date: You know, you were just a punk when we met. Now you‚Äôre a bonafide manager!

Yuya: Aww, I‚Äôve still got a ton to learn, sir!

[Kazuki enters.]

Kazuki: (bows) Welcome.

Date: Hey‚Ä¶ Long time no see. This is Kawara, my senpai from HQ in the force.

Kawara: You must be Kazuki-san? Nice to meet you.

Kazaki: HQ, huh? (bows) A pleasure to meet you, sir.

Date: Sorry to drop two cranky old men on you.

Kazaki: Not at all. Might I ask what brings you here tonight?

Date: I needed to tell you something in private.

Yuya: Oh, I‚Äôll go get you gentlemen some snacks.

[He bows and leaves.]

Kazaki: So what‚Äôs going on?

Date: In about an hour, there‚Äôs going to be a flood of investigators busting in here.

Kazaki: Huh? Why here?

Date: It‚Äôs not just you. They‚Äôre raiding sex shops, bars, casinos‚Ä¶

Kazaki: What brought this on?

Date: The Millennium Tower bombing. Sources are pointing to a foreign organization as the perps.

Kazaki: A foreign organization? Really?

Kawara: Tokyo PD would look like fools if that slipped under their radar. So the plan is to mobilize 400 cops to round up all the illegal aliens in one shot.

Kazaki: But‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt have any illegals working here.

Kawara: You could still get busted on vice laws. Closing up tonight might be better than getting shut down.

Kazaki: True, I guess‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ Why would you tell me this in advance?

Date: I caused quite a scene here last year. Now we‚Äôre even.

Kazaki: Is that so‚Ä¶ Date-san, Kawara-san‚Ä¶ Thank you both so much.

[He bows and leaves.]

Kawara: There. If he‚Äôs mafia, he‚Äôll go straight to his boys.

Date: I still don‚Äôt buy it. No way he‚Äôs got foreign mafia ties.

Kawara: Look what they managed to pull off. They‚Äôre not gonna be easy to bust.

[Kazaki apologizes to the visitors and asks them to leave.]

Date: He‚Äôs not acting strange at all. Sure we‚Äôre not chasing our tails here?

Kawara: Quit staring! You‚Äôll make him nervous.

Date: We can‚Äôt just sit here forever.

Kawara: Just long enough to figure out‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶What his next move is.

[Kazaki runs out of the club.]

Date: What!?

Kawara: Got him! Come on, Makoto!

Yuya: Ah, whoa! What‚Äôs going on, Date-san!?

[Date and Kawara run after Kazaki. We go back to Kiryu and Kaoru.]

Kaoru: Time‚Äôs almost up. Let‚Äôs head to this ‚ÄúAmano Building.‚Äù

Go to the Amano Building
Kaoru: But do you even know where it is?

Kiryu: No‚Ä¶ I can ask Tamura, though.

Kaoru: That‚Äôs your info guy who hangs out near Theater Square? Worth checking, I suppose. But let‚Äôs hurry.

[On his way out of the Siren, Kiryu encounters Yuya. ]

Yuya: Hey, if it isn‚Äôt Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: Yuya. Been a while, hasn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs good to see you.

Yuya: Yeah, likewise. Just wish it was under better circumstances‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Why, what‚Äôs wrong?

Yuya: Oh, it‚Äôs Kazaki‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Kazaki? He‚Äôs okay, right?

Yuya: Er‚Ä¶ Well, I don‚Äôt know, actually. Date-san came by the club for the first time in at least a year, and we were all stoked to see him, but‚Ä¶ Something must have gone wrong, ‚Äôcause Kazaki went running out of the club‚Ä¶

Kiryu: All because of Date-san? What could have happened‚Ä¶

Yuya: I didn‚Äôt want to pry, but he was with another detective, I think.

Kiryu: You know where Date-san is now?

Yuya: He ran out, too. He might have even been chasing after Kazaki.

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶This does sound pretty odd.

Kaoru: Look, I know you‚Äôre worried about this, but don‚Äôt you think the Amano Building should be the real priority here?

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶You‚Äôre right. Yuya, we‚Äôll catch up soon. If anything comes up in the meantime though, just give me a call.

Yuya: All right, will do!

[Kiryu runs to the Theater Square.]

Morita: Ah, Kiryu-san? I‚Äôm Morita. I deal in information. Tamura‚Äôs a friend of mine. He‚Äôs told me a lot a lot about you. But I should mention that I haven‚Äôt seen Tamura lately‚Ä¶Hopefully, he‚Äôll be back soon. Anyway, if you need anything, I‚Äôm happy to help.

You know Kazuki? +
Where‚Äôs the Amano Building?
Any word on Daigo Dojima?

Kiryu: You know Kazuki? I‚Äôve got a friend who‚Äôs worried about him. Any idea where he is?

Morita: Hmm, sorry. That‚Äôs news to me. I‚Äôll keep my ear to the ground, though.

Where‚Äôs the Amano Building? +
Any word on Daigo Dojima?


Kiryu: I‚Äôm looking for the Amano Building. Know where it is?

Morita: Ah, that‚Äôd be in front of the Children‚Äôs Park. It‚Äôs been abandoned for awhile now, though‚Ä¶ I hear this gang of kids has moved in that go by the name, ‚Äú16-Bit.‚Äù

Any word on Daigo Dojima? +

Kiryu: Have you heard any word on Daigo Dojima?

Morita: Hmm, no actually. There used to be news about him every night, but he‚Äôs gone dark. Wonder what happened to him?

[Gathering information, Kiryu easily finds the place.]

Kiryu: This should be the Amano Building‚Ä¶ Hm? It‚Äôs locked.

[Some kids approthes him.]

16-Bit: Hey! You with those assholes inside!?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm sorry?

16-Bit: Playin‚Äô dumb? Well drop your dumb ass!

Minions: Fuck yeah!

[Kiryu and Kaoru easily punch them to the ground.]

16-Bit: Huff‚Ä¶ Huff‚Ä¶

Kiryu: What the hell was that about?

16-Bit: This place‚Ä¶ was our hideout, man‚Ä¶ Then these guys speaking another language showed up‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not with ‚Äòem?

Kiryu: No, I‚Äôm not. But I do want to have some words with them. You know where the key to this place is?

16-Bit: Our boss carries it on him, but he‚Äôs out right now.

Kiryu: Out? Out where?

16-Bit: In the alley behind the drugstore, usually. No way he‚Äôs just gonna give you the key, though!

Kiryu: If you kids are anything to go by, maybe he will.

16-Bit: Pah! Go see for yourself, old man.

Kaoru: Come on.

Kiryu: Right.

[They find the gang ‚Äúboss.‚Äù It‚Äôs just a kid playing on his handheld console.]

Nashino: Whaddaya want!? I‚Äôm fighting a boss here, man! If you know what‚Äôs good for you, you‚Äôll fuck right off!

Kiryu: Hey, you wouldn‚Äôt happen to be the leader of those 16-Bit kids, are you?

Nashino: Gah! It‚Äôs my last continue!

Kaoru: Hey! Have you heard a word we‚Äôve said, little punk!? Put down the damn game!

Nashino: What!? Yeah, I heard you the first time, and I said fuck off!

Kiryu: I just need the key to the Amano Building, and we‚Äôll leave you alone.

Nashino: Are you still here? You‚Äôre throwing me off, asshole!

Kiryu: (grabs him) Sometimes there are more important things in life than video games!

Nashino: Not right now there isn‚Äôt! Sounds like we‚Äôre at an impasse so I‚Äôm gonna kick your ass! Give me just a sec, though‚Ä¶ (calling) Hello? ‚ÄòSup, bro, I got these assholes givin‚Äô me shit right now. Come gimme a hand with this. Yeah! Right now, man!

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶You actually called in back up?

[A fat guy walks in.]

Nashino: Ahh, there‚Äôs my boy!

[Kiryu and Kaoru fight the Nashino Brothers and show them what the real boss fight looks like.]

Kiryu: Hand over the key!

Nashino: I‚Äôve still got‚Ä¶ my second form‚Ä¶

Kaoru: If it‚Äôs anything like your first form, you‚Äôre in for another beating if you don‚Äôt give us that key!

Nashino: Rrgh‚Ä¶ Fine. I remember this‚Ä¶

[He hands over the key and passes away.]

Kaoru: This should get us in. Let‚Äôs get back to the Amano Building!

[Near Amano Building.]

Kiryu: They told me to come alone, so we should part ways here.

Kaoru: Can‚Äôt say I agree with your plan. but fine. Call me if you even think things are going sideways.

[Kiryu enters the building.]

Find Daigo
[He clears floor after floor using the classic baseball bat and even shield to fight armed men in black! On the roof he finds Date, Kawara and‚Ä¶ two Kazuki.]

Kiryu: Date-san!

Date: Kiryu!?

Kawara: Ah, Kiryu.

Kiryu: Kazuki!

Two Kazuki (at the same time): Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: What the hell is this!?

Date: Don‚Äôt ask me. We tailed Kazuki here and found two of him!

Right Kazuki: I‚Äôm the real one! They had me locked up! I was up here when I came to!

Left Kazuki: That‚Äôs a lie! You dragged me up here at gunpoint!

Date: (to Kiryu) Why are you here?

Kiryu: I was told to be here at one o‚Äôclock.

Kawara: The hell?

Kiryu: Figures‚Ä¶ It was a trap.

Kawara: Sure seems that way.

[He aims his gun at the left Kazaki.]

Left Kazaki: Wh-What are you doing?

Date: Kawara-san!

Kawara: The one who led us up here is the fake. He put on a good show down at Stardust, and we took the bait.

Left Kazaki: You‚Äôve got it wrong!

Kawara: Shut up! Don‚Äôt underestimate a cop. Change your face all you like, but you can‚Äôt disguise your voice. I know for sure you‚Äôre the one we spoke to at the bar. Now talk. Why did you lure us up here?

Left Kazaki: I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about!

Kawara: Drop the act! Who‚Äôs the one writing the script here?

Date: (aims at Kawara) Stop! You‚Äôd shoot to kill right in front of me again?

Kawara: Get it straight, Makoto. This guy‚Äôs not the Kazuki you know. Just a mafia goon.

Date: How can you say that without any proof?

Kawara: I just know.

Date: Really? You‚Äôd kill on your intuition?

Kawara: A cop‚Äôs instincts are more than gut feelings. I‚Äôve been in more kill-or-be-killed situations than I can count. This guy reeks of blood. The stench is all over him.

Date: You‚Äôre out of your damn mind‚Ä¶

Kawara: (turns to him) Get back!

[At this moment the Left Kazaki pulls out two guns and shot Kawara in the leg and the Right Kazaki in the chest.]

Date: Kawara-san!

Kiryu: Kazuki!

Left Kazaki: Kiryu‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm the one who called you here yesterday.

Kiryu: It was you‚Ä¶? Where‚Äôs Daigo!?

Left Kazaki: No point in giving details to the dead.

Date: So you brought us all up here to kill us?

Left Kazaki: (laughs) You finally get it. The four of you came up, fought, and shot each other dead. That‚Äôs the ending to your "script."

Date: The four of us? Why the hell would we kill each other?

Left Kazaki: Once you know the ending, the rest of the story writes itself. That‚Äôs just how it works. (laughs)

Kawara: (to Date) Now‚Ä¶ Shoot‚Ä¶ Do it‚Ä¶ Shoot!

[Date thinks for a while and then shoots indecisively, only scratching Left Kazuki‚Äôs forehead.]

Left Kazuki: [You‚Ä¶ bastard! Die!]

[He prepares to shoot Date but someone shoots him first.]

Kaoru: I heard the gunshots.

[She checks the pulse of the Left Kazuki. He‚Äôs dead. Police sirens howling is heard from afar.]

Kiryu: Let‚Äôs go!

Kaoru: Why would we run? That was clearly self-defense!

Date: No, there‚Äôs something fishy about this. We should lay low for now.

Kiryu: Come on!

Date: Right!

[They help Kazuki and Kawara and leave the scene with them.]

Chapter 7: THE FOREIGN THREAT
[They descend to the streets.]

Date: He needs medical attention, fast. Should we drive him to a hospital?

Kiryu: There‚Äôs no time. I know a doctor who runs a clinic in the area. We just need to get him there!

Kaoru: The police are going to be fanning out across the city. You can‚Äôt just carry him like that.

Date: We don‚Äôt have much choice here. If we wait for the cops to pack it in, we might lose him!

Kaoru: Yeah, I know. Still, good luck explaining this to them if they spot you.

Date: You‚Äôre right. We stick out like a sore thumb like this.

Kiryu: Fine, what‚Äôs the plan then?

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôve got an idea.

Kiryu: Yeah?

Kaoru: Let me draw the attention of the cops just outside first. Nothing they can really do to a fellow officer out of their jurisdiction. I‚Äôll keep them occupied as long as I can. You guys head out the other way.

Kiryu: Think you can pull it off?

Kaoru: We‚Äôll find out ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll meet you at the clinic. Where is it?

Kiryu: A little building on the west side of Taihei Boulevard.

Kaoru: Got it!

Hurry to Emoto Clinic
[Kiryu and Date run to the clinic with Kazuki and Kawara on their backs.]

Date: He‚Äôs hurt bad. Doc, please!

Doctor: Huh‚Ä¶ Kawara-san? And you‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Sorry, but this is kind of an emergency.

Doctor: What happened to your leg?

Kawara: Forget about me. He‚Äôs in a lot worse shape.

Doctor: What happened?

Kiryu: He‚Äôs been shot.

Doctor: Hm?

Doctor: I know him‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs a hotshot host in the city, right? We better get him patched up fast. Help me get him on the operating table. This could take a while. I won‚Äôt ask questions, but if people are still after you, you should leave. He doesn‚Äôt need that kind of attention.

Kiryu: Got it.

[They help the doctor with the operation. Some time later‚Ä¶]

Kiryu: This was the last thing I expected, honestly. I‚Äôm still not even sure what happened.

Date: Me either. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to find you up there, myself. We should probably compare notes to see if we can learn anything.

Kiryu: Good call. But let‚Äôs find a better place to talk first.

Date: Know anywhere quiet?

Let‚Äôs go to Serena. +
Let‚Äôs go to Stardust.
Let‚Äôs go to Bantan.

Date: Serena‚Ä¶? What‚Äôs that place like these days?

Kiryu: It‚Äôs deserted. Sayama and I are using it as a home base, though.

Date: I see‚Ä¶ But Serena is across the street from Stardust. That area‚Äôll be flooded with cops.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre right. Let‚Äôs avoid that.

Let‚Äôs go to Serena.
Let‚Äôs go to Stardust.
Let‚Äôs go to Bantan. +

Kiryu: I think Bantam would work.

Date: Bantam?

Kiryu: Remember Bacchus? They closed down, and when it re-opened, they called it Bantam.

Date: Oh, that bar behind the Millennium Tower? That‚Äôs right, I remember now. So it‚Äôs Bantam now, huh?

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ Last year I got to know the bartender there. That‚Äôs far enough away from Stardust.

Date: Heh, Bacchus‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs where you and I joined up for the first time, remember?

Kiryu: Yep. And what a ride it‚Äôs been.

[They walk outside the clinic.]

Date: Man‚Ä¶ I still can‚Äôt get over running into two Kazukis like that.

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ What the hell is going on? I don‚Äôt think we should tell Yuya or the Stardust crew about this yet.

Date: Yeah, we‚Äôd just worry them. Besides, we don‚Äôt know a damn thing about Kazuki‚Äôs double. There‚Äôs nothing to tell them, really.

Kiryu: And I‚Äôd hate to drag Yuya into this mess.

Date: You hear he made manager? I‚Äôm sure he can hold down the fort for a while. I feel bad, but I agree. Let‚Äôs keep him out of this.

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶

[Yuya suddenly runs to them.]

Yuya: Kiryu-san! Date-san!

Date: Yuya!?

Kiryu: How‚Äôd you know we were here?

Yuya: One of our regulars told me she saw a guy who looked like Kazuki being carried in here‚Ä¶ I could hardly believe it, but I came running all the same. What happened, though!? Is he going to be okay!? The doc‚Äôs got him in surgery now. He was shot.

Yuya: Shot‚Ä¶? Why would anyone shoot Kazuki!? Did he get mixed up in something?

Kiryu: Well‚Ä¶

Date: ‚Ä¶There was a yakuza brawl in the street that got out of hand. Unfortunately Kazuki took a stray bullet.

Yuya: Wh-What!? Where are these yakuza, then!? Which of those goddamn bastards did it!? I‚Äôll beat the shit out of the whole family for this!

Kiryu: Calm down Yuya!

Yuya: But‚Ä¶!

Kiryu: Date-san was just telling me you‚Äôre the manager of Stardust now.

Yuya: Y-Yeah‚Ä¶

Kiryu: You‚Äôre the one responsible for your team and your customers‚Ä¶ You of all people should know you can‚Äôt lose your cool now.

Yuya: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Kazuki‚Äôs in bad shape. It‚Äôs tough to think about, but who knows how long he‚Äôll need to recover?

Date: Exactly. Kazuki needs you to be strong. Your boys need your strength now more than ever, too.

Yuya: Kiryu-san, Date-san‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Kazuki‚Äôs going to make it. You just worry about Stardust.

Yuya: ‚Ä¶You‚Äôre right. Y‚Äôknow, even though he promoted me, I don‚Äôt think I ever really stopped relying on Kazuki for everything. But I guess that needs to end‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve gotta pull it together. Thanks, guys. I‚Äôm gonna keep Stardust in the black so Kazuki can rest easy, knowing his club‚Äôs in good hands!

[He leaves.]

Date: Phew‚Ä¶ I guess we‚Äôve got a band-aid on that for now. We can fill him in on the rest once we know more ourselves.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Date: All right, it‚Äôs getting late, but let‚Äôs head for Bantam.

[They walk to Bantam.]

Kiryu: Long time no see, barkeep.

Bartender: K-Kiryu-san!? When did you get back into town? Please, have a seat!

[Date and Kiryu sit at the counter.]

Date: (to Kiryu) Brings you back, doesn‚Äôt it?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Bartender: What‚Äôll it be, then?

Kiryu: Actually, I need a favor.

[The bartender closes the bar so Kiryu and Date can drink in peace.]

Date: So you went to the Amano Building looking for Daigo Dojima?

Kiryu: Yeah. But the part I don‚Äôt get is why someone wants us dead.

Date: Kazuki was just the bait to lure us in. Someone stands to gain from taking us out‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs the link between us, though? I don‚Äôt know.

Kiryu: I‚Äôd guess the foreigners who kidnapped Daigo and Chairman Goda are behind this.

Date: Foreigners?

Kiryu: An Osakan detective named Bessho tipped me off.

Date: Bessho?

Kiryu: You know him?

Date: Used to be in Kamurocho‚Äôs Division Four.

Kiryu: Wait, Kamurocho?

Date: He was their golden boy when I joined up. Came in around the same time as Kawara. "Bessho the Viper" and "Kawara the Demon." They were legendary.

Kiryu: Hell of a story. Date-san, what you said to Kawara back there‚Ä¶ About his kills‚Ä¶

Date: Yeah. I still hold a grudge against the guy.

Kiryu: What exactly happened?

Date: It was just after I started at Division One. More than 15 years ago. As a rookie, I got paired up with Kawara-san, the squad leader back then. We were investigating some illegal aliens‚Ä¶ Trying to track down a murder suspect. Kawara-san was just a rank-and-file cop, but he was famous for his stainless record. I asked to tag along for the ride, hoping to pick up a few tips from him. Didn‚Äôt take long for any respect I had for him to fly out the window, though.

Kiryu: Why‚Äôs that?

Date: They immigrants resisted, so Kawara-san pulled his gun and shot them. Sure, they were putting up a fight. But we‚Äôre protectors of the peace, dammit. Shooting should be our last resort. But Kawara-san just mowed them down‚Ä¶

Kiryu: He shot them all?

Date: Yeah. Dead, every one of them. Kawara-san killed them. I was livid. I asked him, suspected criminals or not, how could he kill them without batting an eye? But all Kawara-san had to say was‚Ä¶ "They left me no choice. This is on them." That wasn‚Äôt the last time Kawara-san opened fire on illegal aliens, either. Every time it happened, it got cleaned up as self-defense‚Ä¶ But people started calling him Killer Kawara, and he eventually got bumped from Division One.

Kiryu: That‚Äôs quite a history.

Date: The image of those men is still burned into my brain.

Kiryu: It sounds like Kawara‚Äôs got some deep scars.

Date: I got the same feeling, but he‚Äôd never go into it. But it‚Äôs not like he just hates foreigners, either‚Ä¶ As for me, Kiryu‚Ä¶ I feel worse that I couldn‚Äôt stop Kawara-san than I do about shooting Kazuki.

Kiryu: Date-san‚Ä¶

Date: He‚Äôs got some seriously heavy baggage. I just wish I could understand him.

Kiryu: Despite it all, you still care about him, don‚Äôt you?

Date: Maybe I do.

[They share a few drinks.]

Date: Say, I wonder what happened to Sayama? I hope she made it out all right‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ I better go look for her.

[He exits the bar. His phone‚Äôs ringing.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Kaoru: I just got to the clinic.. Where are you?

Kiryu: We moved. Me and Date-san headed over to a bar called Bantam.

Kaoru: Wait, you decided now would be a good time to hit the town for drinks?

Kiryu: No, but we couldn‚Äôt stay. I‚Äôll explain later. I think it‚Äôd be best if you meet us over here.

Kaoru: Fine, but where‚Äôs ‚Äúhere‚Äù? I don‚Äôt know the area, remember?

Kiryu: Right. I‚Äôll come get you then. Give me a few.

Kaoru: All right, but hurry.

[Kiryu gets back to the clinic. Kaoru sits there and smokes a cigarette. Kawara sits right next to her.]

Kawara: Smoking doesn‚Äôt suit a lady.

Kaoru: I didn‚Äôt ask. Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre so hot just because you‚Äôre serving in Tokyo.

[But she put the cigarette away.]

Kaoru: What now?

Kawara: Would it kill you to act like a lady?

Kaoru: Excuse me?

Kawara: I hear you‚Äôre lead detective for Division Four.

Kaoru: How‚Äôd you know?

[Kawara throws her a police badge. Her badge.]

Kawara: I found it up on the roof. Might be bad if it turned up at a crime scene, yeah? Probably dropped it when you went for your gun. Smooth move. Not much you can do in a situation like that, though.

Kaoru: You‚Äôre pretty relaxed for a guy with a hole in him.

Kawara: Well, you get used to this sort of thing.

Kaoru: Yeah? I suppose Tokyo cops really do see more action.

Kawara: It‚Äôs not like that. Tokyo, Osaka, it‚Äôs all the same. I‚Äôm just lucky. So, how‚Äôs a gal like you find herself working for Division Four?

Kaoru: None of your business. Why the obsession, anyway?

Kiryu: Sorry I‚Äôm late.

Kaoru: Took your sweet time.

Kiryu: Kawara-san. Are you all right?

Kawara: Yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll pull through.

Kiryu: How‚Äôs Kazuki doing?

Kaoru: Still in surgery. That‚Äôs the latest.

[Suddenly two men burst in!]

Kaoru: What the!?

[One of them punches the doctor]

Doctor: Who the hell are you!?

Man 1: [Is this Kang?]

Man 2: [Hey, you okay? Get up. We came to get you.]

Kazaki: Who‚Ä¶ are you people?

Man 2: [No‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs not Kang!]

[They leave the operation room.]

Kiryu: You guys with those foreign thugs?

Kaoru: Don‚Äôt move! I‚Äôm an officer. (wave her badge) What brings you guys here?

[One of the bandits smacks Kaoru in the face.]

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶Hold up.

Man 1: (with accent) You people‚Ä¶ annoying.

Kiryu: So you do speak Japanese. Makes it that much worse.

Man 1: (with accent) This not concern you.

Kiryu: Oh, it does now.

Man1: What?

Kiryu: I won‚Äôt just watch some asshole punch a woman‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Then try to walk away.

Man 1: Fine. We kill you then! Die!

[Kiryu defeats the rude foreigners which were named Kim and Choi by the way. Kawara stands from the couch with his trusty revolver.]

Kawara: Damn, you are tough. Who sent you?

Kiryu: Don‚Äôt!

[Kawara shots near Man 1‚Äôs head.]

Kawara: The next one won‚Äôt miss‚Ä¶ Talk!

Man 1: [Korean syndicate‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Jingweon Mafia.]

Kawara: I‚Äôm starting to see.

Kiryu: What did he say?

[Police sirens are heard from afar.]

Kawara: ‚Ä¶That was quick.

Kaoru: The police are on high alert.

Kawara: We can‚Äôt stay here‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll talk later.

Kiryu: Let‚Äôs join Date-san at the bar.

[They go outside the clinic.]

Kiryu: Date‚Äôs waiting at a bar called Bantam.

Kaoru: Let‚Äôs move, then.

Kawara: Sorry, but you guys go ahead. I can‚Äôt walk around looking like this. I‚Äôll need to find a change of pants.

Kaoru: You gonna be okay on your own?

Kawara: I‚Äôll be fine. See you guys at Bantam.

Kiryu: All right.

[Kiryu and Kaoru walk to Bantam.]

Date: Oh, you‚Äôre back.

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ Where‚Äôs the barkeep?

Date: He stepped out. Took you long enough, though.

Kawara: Yeah, but we got ourselves a lead.

Date: What sort of lead?

Kawara: A couple of heavies came after Kazuki, and we made them cough up a name.

[He pushes his notebook to Date with handwritten ÁúüÊã≥Ê¥æ.]

Date: True Fist Faction‚Ä¶?

Kawara: In Korean, true is "jin," fist is ‚Äúgweon," and the character for faction is read, ‚Äúpa.‚Äù But that‚Äôs a Japanese reading.

Date: So Jingweon Mafia‚Ä¶ A Korean mafia?

Kawara: Without a doubt.

Kaoru: I‚Äôve never heard of them before.

Kawara: I‚Äôd be surprised if you had. They‚Äôre not like Japan‚Äôs yakuza. This is a mafia we‚Äôre talking about. They‚Äôre not gonna wear flashy pins. The name‚Äôs just a label anyway. They couldn‚Äôt care less about it. What they do care about‚Ä¶ is absolute loyalty.

Kiryu: So this Jingweon Mafia kidnapped Daigo and Chairman Goda?

Date: Yeah, that‚Äôs what it looks like.

Kaoru: Good thing you understand Korean, then.

Kawara: I picked up a little‚Ä¶

Date: I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre safe here. We should head out soon.

Kiryu: Why do you say that?

Date: I think they‚Äôre onto this place, if you ask me.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre serious?

Date: The barkeep‚Äôs been acting strange‚Ä¶ He keeps coming and going. Like he‚Äôs talking to someone. And‚Ä¶

Kawara: And what?

Date: Seems like he‚Äôs after you, too.

Kaoru: Me‚Ä¶?

Date: These pictures were behind the bar.

Kaoru: Why would he have these?

[It‚Äôs a photo of Kaoru and Kiryu.]

Kiryu: Let me handle this one. I‚Äôll ask him about it. (to Kaoru) You take Date-san and Kawara-san back to Serena.

Kaoru: All right.

[Kawara, Date and Kaoru leave the bar. Some time later the barkeep returns.]

Bartender: Hm? Kiryu-san, you‚Äôre back.

Kiryu: Barkeep, know anything about these photos?

Bartender: Th-Those‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Come on, barkeep. We go back more than a year. I would never want to cause you any trouble. But can you at least tell me what‚Äôs going on?

Bartender: I-It‚Äôs not that‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Who put you up to this?

Bartender: Uh, no, I‚Ä¶

[Three armed men burst into the bar.]

Cook: He leaves us no choice, barkeeper. This is the only way!

Bartender: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ Please let us kill you! We beg you‚Ä¶!

[Kiryu finishes his drink and fights the citizens of Kamurocho. Despite the fact that they are armed with bats, he handles them easily.]

Bartender: I‚Äôm so sorry! After what happened last year, we lost our whole clientele. We‚Äôre so deep in debt‚Ä¶

Kiryu: You borrowed dirty money?

Bartender: The banks were turning me away at the door‚Ä¶ There were loan sharks hounding me every day‚Ä¶ Then out of nowhere, a guy showed up and offered to pay it all off‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Who‚Äôs making offers like that?

Bartender: He said he was from the Sengoku Family‚Ä¶ Then he gave me those photos.

Kiryu: So he put a bounty on our heads.

Bartender: I‚Äôm afraid so. I was at a loss‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ Against the wall like that, what choice did I have? So, please ‚Äì

Kiryu: Hey, it‚Äôs fine.

Bartender: Huh?

Kiryu: Last year‚Ä¶ was mostly my fault.

Bartender: Wha? B-But‚Ä¶

Kiryu: I‚Äôll take care of all of this. Just hold on a little longer. Until then, I want you to stay put. Keep serving fine drinks to fine people.

Bartender: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Knowing you have a place to make part of your daily routine‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs your soul‚Äôs salvation in a city like this. So‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt just throw this place away.

Bartender: (bows) Thank you!

[Kiryu leaves the bar.]

Kiryu: (Everyone‚Äôs waiting for me at Serena.)

[He goes back to Serena.]

Date: Hey, you‚Äôre back.

Kaoru: So, was it the Omi Alliance pulling the strings?

Kiryu: Yeah, Sengoku. Took advantage of the barkeep‚Äôs financial woes.

Kaoru: Oh.

Kiryu: (to Date) What‚Äôs wrong? Did something happen?

Date: Kiryu‚Ä¶ Things just took an ugly turn. The Amano Building shooting‚Ä¶ Apparently I‚Äôm wanted for murder.

Kiryu: How can that be?

Kawara: Surveillance cameras picked up Makoto firing his gun.

Chapter 8: SUSPECT
[Some high ranked police official watch the security footage with Sudo and Kurahashi.]

Police Official: Any way you look at it, Date shot him.

Sudo: Something‚Äôs off about this though!

Police Official: (shows a bullet) We found this on the scene. Forensics confirms it came from his pistol.

Sudo: As I‚Äôve explained, he was contracting for us on a classified investigation‚Ä¶

Police Official: Ex-cop or not civilians have no business carrying firearms.

Sudo: True enough, but consider his record here. Pinning down the group that bombed the Millennium Tower would‚Äôve been tough without him.

Police Official: So who is this group you‚Äôre pursuing?

Kurahashi: The Jingweon Mafia.

Police Official: Jingweon Mafia? That‚Äôs absurd. They were annihilated years ago.

Kurahashi: No‚Ä¶ Foreign Affairs has been watching them for six months. We have a resurgence of Jingweon survivors in Kamurocho.

Police Official: Is that reliable information?

Kurahashi: Yes. The man we‚Äôd marked was the owner of the Stardust host club. Evidence suggested he was one of them.

Police Official: Then why didn‚Äôt Foreign Affairs perform a standard investigation?

Sudo: Kazuki is a cautious man, and sharp. Chief Kurahashi suggested we bring in Date-san due to his familiarity with Kazuki.

Police Official: I can see the logic‚Ä¶ But here‚Äôs the result of that. We‚Äôll need to arrest Date.

Sudo: Arrest him!?

Police Official: Imagine this going public. An ex-cop scandal would have the media tripping over itself. I want Date brought in immediately.

Sudo: Please, sir, wait!

Police Official: Effective immediately. Division One is taking command of this investigation. The Jingweon investigation too. Foreign Affairs and Division Four are off the case. Are we clear?

Sudo: ‚Ä¶Yes sir.

Kurahashi: Understood.

Police Official: That‚Äôs all then.

[He leaves the room.]

Sudo: Chief Kurahashi‚Ä¶

Kurahashi: I know. I‚Äôm responsible for what happened to Date-san. I‚Äôll think of something‚Ä¶

[Back to Serena‚Ä¶]

Kaoru: That video doesn‚Äôt show half of what happened up there.

Kawara: Yeah, but headquarters doesn‚Äôt know that.

Kaoru: Even so, how is that footage enough to incriminate him?

Kawara: This department relies on video footage to verify everything these days.

Kaoru: I‚Äôm the one who shot him. I‚Äôll turn in my gun and give a statement.

Kawara: Don‚Äôt bother. Reality is, they threw a civilian into a classified investigation, even if he is an ex-cop. And Makoto‚Äôs bullet from the crime scene is all the "ammo" they need. They‚Äôd take your smoking gun and just bury it.

Kiryu: Did that footage come from the Florist?

Kawara: Most likely.

Date: Then we need to hunt down the Jingweon, fast.

Kawara: Still, if you stay in Kamurocho, it‚Äôs only a matter of time until they arrest you. You should probably skip town.

Date: (to Kiryu) What‚Äôs your plan, then?

Kiryu: Track down Daigo, then start looking for the Jingweon Mafia from there.

Date: Track him down how?

Kiryu: I think I‚Äôm gonna need to pay him a visit.

Date: The Florist?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Date: I‚Äôll give you a call if I find anything.

[Kawara and Date leave the room.]

Kaoru: We need to dig up what we can on the Jingweon Mafia, right away. For Date-san‚Äôs sake too‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yeah. Our best bet right now is the Florist. He‚Äôs apparently up in the Millennium Tower now.

Kaoru: Yeah. Let‚Äôs head over.

Go to the Millennium Tower
[They run to the Tower and find out that the entrance is blocked by the police.]

Police Officer: No one‚Äôs allowed beyond this point.

Kaoru: (shows her badge) It‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôm on your side.

Police Officer: Oh? M-My apologies, ma‚Äôam!

[Kiryu and Kaoru enter the Tower.]

Kaoru: Is this the place?

Kiryu: Yeah. On the 50th floor. The elevators are up ahead.

[They go up to the 50th floor. They are greeted by the Florist in a police uniform. He sits behind a giant video surveillance system.]

The Florist: Haven‚Äôt seen you in a while, Kiryu.

Kiryu: I see you‚Äôve gone from underground hideout to high-profile luxury suite‚Ä¶ You always were full of surprises.

The Florist: Lovely young lady you‚Äôve got there.

Kiryu: She‚Äôs a detective with Osaka‚Äôs Division Four.

The Florist: Kaoru Sayama-san, correct?

Kaoru: How‚Äôd you know my name?

The Florist: Passed the Tier 10 Public Service Exam at 20 while in technical college. Joined the Osaka Prefectural Police on that career track with a state recommendation. Entered Division Four where, as of this April‚Ä¶ You set a record by getting promoted to assistant inspector in four years. Following said promotion, you made Division Four lead detective. AKA, the "Yakuza Huntress." I leave anything out?

Kaoru: How‚Äôd you know all that?

The Florist: I‚Äôve tracked pretty much all of your activity since you got to Kamurocho. I just did a little homework on the side.

Kiryu: Impressive as ever.

The Florist: Yeah, well.

Kiryu: Then you already know why we‚Äôre here.

The Florist: Yeah, I‚Äôve got a guess. This Daigo Dojima issue?

Kiryu: Yeah. Daigo‚Äôs kidnappers led me to the Amano Building‚Ä¶

The Florist: And that landed you in a shootout. You‚Äôre wrapped up in a real mess, huh?

Kaoru: Date-san said the video the police are using as evidence came from you.

The Florist: It‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ That was pure bad luck. The way the camera was angled, you could only see Date and Kazuki.

Kiryu: As a result, he‚Äôs a murder suspect now.

The Florist: I know. I feel guilty.

Kaoru: Hm? How so?

The Florist: If I‚Äôd seen it first‚Ä¶ I never would have handed over a tape so full of holes as evidence. Not that it means anything now, but it was submitted behind my back.

Kiryu: What are you implying?

The Florist: In short‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve got a rat problem here.

Kaoru: A spy?

The Florist: I can‚Äôt say for sure, but take the bombing that happened upstairs. I should have seen that one from a mile away. Yet none of the relevant data ever came through here.

Kaoru: So someone‚Äôs sneaking around, filtering your data from the inside?

The Florist: We‚Äôve got eyes on Kamurocho 24 hours a day here. But even I‚Äôve gotta sleep sometimes. And when the cat‚Äôs away, the rats will play.

Kiryu: Any idea who this rat is?

The Florist: No. The team here is made up of all my old buddies from Purgatory. Hard to imagine any of them could be a turncoat‚Ä¶

Security Camera Guy: Boss! I‚Äôve got a visual on our man!

The Florist: Push it to the main monitor!

[Two men on video pouches someone out of a car.]

Kiryu: Was that Daigo?

The Florist: Yeah. Figured I‚Äôd get a jump on tracking him before you showed up. Pinpoint that location!

Security Camera Guy: Taihei Boulevard! The building is ‚Äî

[The lights go off.]

The Florist: What‚Äôs going on!?

Security Camera Guy: The power‚Äôs down!

The Florist: Why though!?

Security Camera Guy: Looks like trouble in the transformer room! We‚Äôll switch over to the backup system!

The Florist: The whole building‚Äôs power comes from the transformer room.

Security Camera Guy 2: Boss! Intruders in the transformer room! I‚Äôll put ‚Äôem on the monitor now!

[Some guys in masks crushing transformers with sledgehammers.]

The Florist: Who are these fools? How many we got!?

Security Camera Guy 2: Eight, sir!

Kiryu: Where is that room!?

The Florist: Basement, B10. You going to do your thing?

Kiryu: Yeah. They‚Äôre stopping me from getting Daigo‚Äôs location.

[He and Kaoru enter the transformer room. Kiryu punches the mysterious intruders to the floor without even saying hi. The last one comes from the shadows afterwards.]

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶And he makes eight.

Kiryu: Right. He‚Äôs the last one.

[The intruder takes off his mask. It‚Äôs Hiroshi Hayashi, an Omi assassin from the first game.]

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶You!

Hayashi: (in Kiryu‚Äôs memory) Kiryu-han, be a pal and hand the girl over. Killin‚Äô a guy like you in a place like this would be a cryin‚Äô shame. Do it! Boys‚Ä¶ Kill ‚Äôim!

Kaoru: Who is he?

Kiryu: Hayashi, of the Omi Alliance.

Kaoru: Omi!?

Kiryu: Why are you doing this?

Hayashi: These days I work for Ryuji-san. I got nothin‚Äô to do with Omi proper anymore.

Kiryu: What? So he sent you here to slow us down?

Hayashi: (laughs) His reasons ain‚Äôt my business. All I got was orders from the man to bust this room up.

Kaoru: I remember now‚Ä¶ A year ago, the name "Hayashi" was struck from our list of Omi officers. Figures that he‚Äôd go crawling to the Go-Ryu Clan‚Ä¶

Hayashi: You the lady detective they call the Yakuza Huntress, miss?

Kaoru: That‚Äôs Detective Sayama. Division Four.

Hayashi: Wow, a stand-up cop like you gettin‚Äô cozy with a former yakuza chairman? Crazy, right?

Kaoru: Don‚Äôt get cocky now! Breaking and entering, destruction of property‚Ä¶ Add resisting arrest if you give us any more lip. You‚Äôre in it deep.

Hayashi: That a threat? It don‚Äôt mean much to a man who already gave up everything.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Hayashi: Hayashi of the Omi Alliance is dead and gone. Seein‚Äô Ryuji-san rise to the top‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm makin‚Äô it happen‚Ä¶ Even if it means goin‚Äô to prison or worse!

[Kiryu fights him and wins.]

Hayashi: You‚Äôre still a beast‚Ä¶ Kiryu‚Ä¶

Kaoru: I had no idea Ryuji‚Äôs band had officer-level guys like Hayashi‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yeah, and sending him here is a clear sign.

Kaoru: (pulls a lever) Well, that takes care of the power.

Kiryu: Good. Let‚Äôs head back up.

[They return to The Florist.]

Security Camera Guy: Boss! The system‚Äôs coming back up!

The Florist: Good. Give her some juice! I want eyes on Daigo Dojima!

Security Camera Guy: Yes sir!

Security Camera Guy 2: Boss!

The Florist: An error?

Security Camera Guy: No‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre being hacked!

The Florist: What the hell!?

Kiryu: What‚Äôs wrong?

The Florist: Somebody‚Äôs hacked into the system to block our access.

Kiryu: Another Go-Ryu surprise?

The Florist: If how it looks is how it is, then yeah.

[Programmers fight begins! It‚Äôs pretty obvious what the rat is Security Camera Guy 2 and he fights with Security Camera Guy for control of the system.]

Security Camera Guy: Damn‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre fast! I can‚Äôt keep up!

Kaoru: Allow me.

Security Camera Guy: Huh?

Kaoru: Move it! Okay then‚Ä¶

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶Wow.

[Kaoru types something without understanding the system she‚Äôs on. And of course she beat the professional that built the system.]

Security Camera Guy: Unreal!

The Florist: I guess it figures.

Kiryu: Figures how?

The Florist: What, you didn‚Äôt know? Sayama‚Äôs actually in her element here.

Kiryu: Her element?

The Florist: My file on her says she mastered programming at tech school. That‚Äôs how she landed the job on the force. She came in as an engineer for the high-tech crime unit under Foreign Affairs.

Kiryu: High-tech crime unit‚Ä¶

The Florist: Right, they‚Äôre desk jockeys who track internet crimes and all that Sayama tested for the Tier II career track. But she was hired as a specialist, and you‚Äôre looking at it.

Kiryu: So, how‚Äôd she wind up in Organized Crime?

The Florist: She applied in person right after she got placed. Probably planned on going to Division Four from the get-go.

Kiryu: Why Division Four‚Ä¶?

The Florist:Hey, all I‚Äôve got is her file. My cameras can‚Äôt see inside her head.

Kaoru: Whoever he is, he‚Äôs good. Ooh, gotchya.

[She returns the control of the cameras to the Florist.]

Kiryu: That was impressive.

Security Camera Guy: I‚Äôve got a fix on Daigo Dojima!

The Florist: Where?

Security Camera Guy: Taihei Boulevard, sir! A room in the Shangri-La!

The Florist: Shangri-La!?

Kaoru: You know it?

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ I was there last year. (to the Florist) I owe you one.

The Florist: All things considered around here, they‚Äôre gonna know you‚Äôve found him.

Kiryu: The only reason they‚Äôd bring him to Kamurocho at all is to bait me.

The Florist: Probably a safe assumption. You be careful out there.

Kiryu: I will.

[Kiryu and Kaoru leaves.]

The Florist: An ex-yakuza and a Division Four cop‚Ä¶ Helluva pair.

[Kiryu and Kaoru approach a spooky looking house.]

Kaoru: This is the place?

Kiryu: Yeah.

[They enter the house.]

Kiryu: (The place is trashed. Majima-san, the truck was a little much‚Ä¶)

Kaoru: Hey, this place is creepy. Let‚Äôs hurry up and find this guy.

Kiryu: It‚Äôs probably dangerous to even move through there. Let me handle this one. If I make it through, we‚Äôll know it‚Äôs safe.

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶All right. I‚Äôm not too keen on being buried in rubble anyway.

Find Daigo
[Kiryu rushes through the house kicking yakuza ass. In one of the rooms he find his friend with a couple of yakuza guarding him.]

Kiryu: Give him back or else.

[He and Kaoru defeat Go-Ryu Clan yakuzas. After that Kiryu unties Daigo.]

Daigo: Thanks‚Ä¶ They took Chairman Goda someplace else. ‚Ä¶Sorry.

Kiryu: No, I‚Äôm sorry I took so long to get here. You okay?

Daigo: Not really‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm dying here.

Kiryu: What‚Äôs wrong? What‚Äôd they break?

Daigo: That‚Äôs not it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fuckin‚Äô starving, man.

Kiryu: I think you‚Äôre gonna pull through.

Majima Saga - Chapter 2: PRODIGAL SON
[Majima tells that happened to Uematsu to the chairman and other patriarchs at the next meeting.]

Ibuchi: This incident we have‚Ä¶ Care to explain yourself, Majima-san?

Majima: Nothin‚Äô to explain, actually. I went in and found Uematsu dead. All there is to it.

Ibuchi: Majima-san and Uematsu were rivals for the clan captain‚Äôs seat. And it‚Äôs purely coincidence, then, that Majima-san discovered his corpse?

Majima: Somethin‚Äô you‚Äôre gettin‚Äô at? If ya got somethin‚Äô to say, spit it out.

Ibuchi: I‚Äôm saying that Uematsu‚Äôs death‚Ä¶ Was probably by your own hand!

Kashiwagi: Enough with the absurd speculation! What proof do you have that Majima did it!?

Ibuchi: None, at the moment. But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs only a matter of time until I do. Uematsu was Majima-san‚Äôs only obstacle for the captain‚Äôs chair. He has a clear motive for the murder. They call Majima-san the "mad dog" for a reason‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him. Shall we end this charade? ough to watch the old guard stumble to cover for each other.

Kashiwagi: You son of a‚Ä¶!

Majima: Kashiwagi-san! It‚Äôs cool.

Kashiwagi: Majima..

Majima: I get real tired real quick of guys who talk in circles‚Ä¶ So I think I‚Äôm gonna bail on this stupid little tea party of yours. You gonna stop yappin‚Äô if I bring ya the head of Uematsu‚Äôs killer?

Ibuchi: Yes, of course. If you can, that is.

[Majima leaves the meeting and the building.]

Uematsu Family Member: You kept us waiting, Majima.

Majima: Uematsu‚Äôs strays, I take it?

Uematsu Family Member: You thought we were gonna just sit in the office and mourn? We won‚Äôt be satisfied until you don‚Äôt have a pulse!

Majima: (pulls out his tanto and laughs) Nice‚Ä¶ At least Uematsu raised his boys up right!

[He kicks their asses.]

Uematsu Family Member: Damn‚Ä¶ Too strong‚Ä¶

Majima: Yeah, learned any lessons today? I can take six guys with my good eye shut. Didn‚Äôt ya figure that out when ya jumped me in Kamurocho?

Uematsu Family Member: In‚Ä¶ Kamurocho? What do you mean? That wasn‚Äôt us, man‚Ä¶

Majima: Eh?

Kashiwagi: Majima! Are these guys Uematsu Family? Idiots! You attacked him with no evidence to suggest he even did it!?

Majima: It‚Äôs cool, Kashiwagi. Their boss just took a bullet‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt blame ‚Äôem for wantin‚Äô to take out some pent-up aggression.

Kashiwagi: Hmm‚Ä¶ Then what‚Äôs your next move, Majima?

Majima: Eh, I figured I‚Äôd just start smackin‚Äô up every thug this side of town. Rattle enough skulls, you‚Äôre bound to hit the right one eventually.

Kashiwagi: I should have expected as much‚Ä¶ Here‚Ä¶ This might help.

Majima: What‚Äôs this?

Kashiwagi: The name and location of a legendary information dealer‚Ä¶ The Florist of Sai.

Majima: What‚Äôs he gonna have for me, a pretty bouquet?

Kashiwagi: That and every bit of info you could ask for. If it happens in Kamurocho, he‚Äôll know. At the very least, there‚Äôs no harm in starting there.

Majima: Yeah, less bloody that way too. Much obliged, Kashiwagi-san.

Kashiwagi: We need your attention on the clan. The Tojo Clan is on a precipice here. Find the real culprit. Clear your name and any doubt from Terada and his lackeys.

Majima: Can‚Äôt say I honestly give a damn about Terada and his circus monkeys. I ain‚Äôt gonna complicate this. I wanna find the guy who set me up and dislocate a few bones.

Kashiwagi: This whole thing stinks, Majima‚Ä¶ Be careful out there.

Majima: (So this legendary informant hangs out at the top of the Millennium Tower? Talk about hidin‚Äô in plain sight. Guess I‚Äôll drop in.)

[He goes to Kamurocho, finds the Tower and goes up to the 50th floor.]

The Florist: Yo. I knew you‚Äôd come, Goro Majima.

Majima: Oh yeah? Nothin‚Äô gets past you, eh? That business ‚Äôbout you bein‚Äô a legendary informant‚Äôs true, I take it.

The Florist: If I couldn‚Äôt keep tabs on a guy who dresses like you‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd have no business doing what I do here. All the same, I‚Äôll ask. What are you here to find out?

Majima: The truth behind this whole mess, of course. If I‚Äôm bein‚Äô set up by some schemin asshole‚Ä¶ Then I‚Äôm not chillin‚Äô out ‚Äôtil I find and crush the fool.

The Florist: Considering how hot this is‚Ä¶ The details won‚Äôt come cheap.

Majima: All good. For once, I‚Äôve got a barrel fulla cash. How much?

The Florist: Nope. I‚Äôm not taking cash on this one. I‚Äôll sell you this in exchange for a single favor. How‚Äôs that sound?

Majima: Hm. Kinda depends on the favor.

The Florist: I used to run this place called Purgatory before I came up here. I want you to take over operations.

Majima: Purgatory‚Ä¶?

The Florist: You enter from a bathroom in West Park. It‚Äôs like an underground city. I used to have my "office" down there. It‚Äôs got anything you could desire. From gambling to an underground fighting ring.

Majima: Hoho‚Ä¶ Now you‚Äôre speakin‚Äô my language.

The Florist: Well‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs been getting neglected, for obvious reasons. I want someone I can trust to take care of it.

Majima: I ain‚Äôt the kinda guy you can trust.

The Florist: Who I can trust or not is my call to make‚Ä¶ Not yours. So? Are my terms agreeable?

Majima: Heh, fine, long as this ends with punchin‚Äô. Takin‚Äô care of a few layers of Purgatory won‚Äôt slow me down.

The Florist: I‚Äôd say we have a deal, then.

[He pushes a button. The videos on all the screens change.]

Majima: Whoa, what the!?

The Florist: It‚Äôs all in the job. My intersection on the information super highway of Kamurocho. Now, let‚Äôs pull up Uematsu‚Äôs untimely demise. Give that monitor a look.

Majima: Wait a minute, that‚Äôs me!

The Florist: Yeah. Let‚Äôs start from where you raided the Uematsu office. And if we rewind a bit‚Ä¶

Majima: That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Kawamura!? Why would he..!?

The Florist: Who knows? You‚Äôll have to ask him yourself. Not like I can record what‚Äôs in someone‚Äôs head. Where you headed?

Majima: My only option! Back to my office! Kawamura has some explainin‚Äô to do!

The Florist: Sorry, but he‚Äôs not in Kamurocho anymore.

Majima: Then where is he!?

The Florist: In Sotenbori.

Majima: Sotenbori‚Ä¶?

[Majima returns to his cradle, to his prison‚Ä¶ Sotenbori.]

Majima: Back here of all places‚Ä¶

(Let‚Äôs just focus on findin‚Äô Kawamura. Best place to round up info here is probably‚Ä¶ Well, shit. This blows. But ya gotta do what ya gotta do.)

=Go to the Cabaret Grand=
Club Grand Waiter: Welcome to the Grand, sir! Is this your first visit, sir?

Majima: Uh‚Ä¶ First time as a guest‚Ä¶

Club Grand Waiter: Any particular hostess you‚Äôd like to request, then?

Majima: Nah‚Ä¶ Just set me up with whoever‚Äôs popular with young assholes.

Club Grand Waiter: O-Oh, yes sir‚Ä¶

Majima: Don‚Äôt sweat it, I got money to burn.

Club Grand Waiter: Huh? Er‚Ä¶ Yes, sir, understood!

[He sits on a couch with a hostess.]

Hostess: Hello, sir! Would ya like to start with a cocktail?

Majima: Nah, let‚Äôs jump straight to the best bottle in the house.

Hostess: Really? You mean that?

Majima: Sure. That‚Äôll be a nice chunk of change for ya, right? But I‚Äôm hopin‚Äô you‚Äôll indulge me on this burnin‚Äô question I got in exchange.

Hostess:  Oh, no problem! How can I help ya?

Majima: (shows a photo of Kawamura) Just wanna know if you‚Äôve seen this guy around.

Hostess: Hm? Oh, can‚Äôt say that I have‚Ä¶ Or at least, he‚Äôs not been at my table. I figured a girl like you might have the

Majima: That so‚Ä¶ I figured a girl like you might have the inside scoop‚Ä¶

Hostess: Hmm‚Ä¶ Well, I‚Äôll tell ya what, I‚Äôll ask around with the other girls.

Majima: You‚Äôd do that for me?

Hostess: Sure! The crowds are light today. They‚Äôll have enough time. Besides, a guy who orders a bottle at these prices deserves a little TLC.

Majima: Heh, give my regards to your manager, I‚Äôll leave ya to it.

[Some time later she returns with a girl.]

Hostess: Sir, I think Ayumi-chan here might have a lead for you.

Ayumi: (bows) It‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you, sir.

Hostess: That guy in the picture‚Ä¶ Ayumi-chan recognized him.

Majima: Did ya now?

Ayumi: I did, I did! Kawamura, right? We went to the same junior high. But to be honest, he hung out with a rough crowd, so I avoided him most of the time.

Majima: Well, I happen to be lookin‚Äô for the rascal. Ya heard anything more recent?

Ayumi: Um‚Ä¶ Only bad news‚Ä¶ It sounds like he had some debt problems.

Majima: Debt collectors, eh?

Ayumi: Yeah, I guess he‚Äôs a bit of a gambler. He was in town askin‚Äô some of my friends if he could borrow money. But they weren‚Äôt dumb. They knew they‚Äôd never see that money again.

Majima: Smart girls.

Ayumi: So I guess he borrowed money from the local yakuza, and‚Ä¶ Well, interest rates and all‚Ä¶ It sounded like he was runnin‚Äô from some guys I wouldn‚Äôt mess with.

Majima: I‚Äôm gettin‚Äô the picture‚Ä¶ Anythin‚Äô else come to mind?

Ayumi: Hm, not really‚Ä¶ Sorry I couldn‚Äôt be of more help.

Majima: Nah, you‚Äôve been a doll. Here, would ya mind callin‚Äô me if anything comes up? I get the feelin‚Äô it will.

Ayumi: Sure! You‚Äôre trying to help him, right?

Majima: (So Kawamura was carryin‚Äô debt, huh? I just gotta figure out how that connects to Uematsu‚Ä¶ Better hit the town and see what I can dig up.)

[He walks out of Grand. Five men in black suits approach Majima.]

Majima: Hm? Ya knew I‚Äôd come, eh? Must mean I‚Äôm getting closer to the guy you boys work for‚Ä¶ But if ya think ya got the drop on me‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre dead wrong!

[Majima cuts through them.]

Majima: (I gotta get to the bottom of this shit. If the Grand was a bust, maybe I‚Äôll try my luck at Odyssey. ‚Ä¶Assumin‚Äô the place is still standin‚Äô. Heh. If memory serves, Odyssey is in South Shofukucho.)

=Go to Odyssey=
[Majima runs to South Shofukucho, but only finds a place called Andromeda.]

Majima: (This is where Odyssey woulda been‚Ä¶ So much for that!)

[He walks a couple of stems and sees an advertisement.]

Majima: (Four Shine? Heh, the ol‚Äô club‚Äôs got copycats now? Guess the cabaret club business is still boomin‚Äô.)

[A man named Yamagata walks down the stairs towards Majima.]

Yamagata: Well, that was miserable. They‚Äôve got a year, tops..

Majima: Whoa. I know you. You‚Äôre the old manager of the Odyssey. Yamagata-han?

Yamagata: Yours isn‚Äôt a face I‚Äôd forget either. Well, well, Majima of the Grand. You disappeared so fast, I was sure you‚Äôd gotten erased. To what do we owe the pleasure of your triumphant return?

Majima: Nothin‚Äô so grandiose. I‚Äôm just lookin‚Äô for a guy. Thought I‚Äôd pop into the Odyssey to get some intel, but it seems to have gone belly-up.

Yamagata: Right. It wasn‚Äôt sustainable with the numbers it was pulling in. But that‚Äôs all in the past. Maybe I can help?

Majima: Maybe. Know this guy? (shows the photo)

Yamagata: Hmm‚Ä¶

Majima: That a yes?

Yamagata: Not by name, but I‚Äôve shared a table with the man. He‚Äôs a mahjong addict. Any time of day I went there, I‚Äôd see him. Even sat at his table a few times. Not a bad player for a kid.

Majima: Mahjong, huh?

Yamagata: Yes, but that parlor‚Äôs gone now too. It‚Äôs been maybe a few years since they shut their doors. Outdated info like that probably isn‚Äôt much use, is it? Sorry.

Majima: Nah, it‚Äôs enough. But that mahjong parlor‚Ä¶ Where was it?

Yamagata: A little deeper south in Shofukucho. Above a massage parlor named "Hogushi Kaikan."

Majima: Hogushi Kaikan!?

Yamagata: Yes, remember that explosion back in the ‚Äò80s? It closed down after that‚Ä¶ But then it re-open the following year. Who knows? Maybe the staff there could tell you something. Your buddy there‚Ä¶ When he had a good day at the tables, he‚Äôd go downstairs and get a massage.

Majima: Would he, now. I owe ya one, Yamagata-han.

Yamagata: Ha, hardly. Yesterday‚Äôs foes are tomorrow‚Äôs friends. Don;t be a stranger, Majima-han.

Majima: Heh, maybe.

[Yamagata leaves.]

Majima: (Hogushi Kaikan, huh‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs get this over with.)

[The two girls who are familiar to us are quietly watching him‚Ä¶]

Koyuki: Huh? He left!

Yuki: You sure you saw him?

Koyuki: Yes! There was a creepy man with an eyepatch just down there! I wanted to yell at him to move along, but I was too scared‚Ä¶

Yuki: Hmm‚Ä¶ You think he was sent to intimidate us? Eh, doesn‚Äôt matter. He‚Äôs gone now.

Koyuki: That‚Äôs true.

Yuki: Come on, let‚Äôs go back inside.

Koyuki: Yeah.

[She walks away.]

Yuki: A creepy guy‚Ä¶ wearing an eyepatch? ‚Ä¶Nahhh. No way.

[Meanwhile Majima has no trouble finding an important place from his past - Hogushi Kaikan „Åª„Åê„ÅóÂø´È§® (approximate translation - Relaxation Center).]

Majima: (So they rebuilt Hogushi Kaikan, eh? Kinda the last place I wanna be‚Ä¶ But a lead‚Äôs a lead, right? No other way around this‚Ä¶ Okay, good talk. Let‚Äôs just do this!)

[He gets inside.]

Majima: It‚Äôs hardly changed at all‚Ä¶

Nurse: Welcome! Right this way, sir! Which course would you like?

Majima: Ah, actually, I just have a question for ya. I heard this guy was a regular in here‚Ä¶

Nurse: Ohhh! Kawamura-kun, right? I used to do his massages all the time.

Majima: Really!?

Nurse: Yes, although I haven‚Äôt seen him here in a year or so.

Majima: A year, huh? That‚Äôs about the time he joined up with me‚Ä¶ Well y‚Äôsee, he‚Äôs in a bit of trouble, so I gotta find him. Anything helps! Can ya tell me when ya saw him last?

Nurse: Hmmm‚Ä¶ Oh! Actually‚Ä¶ The last day he was in the store, he said somethin‚Äô strange‚Ä¶

Majima: Strange, huh?

Nurse: Yes, Kawamura-kun was always playin‚Äô mahjong upstairs‚Ä¶ But on that last day, he was really excited, talkin‚Äô about being free of his debts‚Ä¶

Majima: He cleared his debt?

Nurse: Yes, he said he‚Äôd met someone who would shoulder the whole thing‚Ä¶ And that he‚Äôd be going to Kamurocho with him, so he wouldn‚Äôt be back‚Ä¶

Majima: So his savior took him out to Kamurocho?

Nurse: I didn‚Äôt know people even did that kinda thing! Made me a little jealous.

Majima: Anythin‚Äô else come to mind?

Nurse: Hmm‚Ä¶ It was pretty long ago‚Ä¶ Sorry.

Majima: Nah, you‚Äôve helped a ton. Thanks, lady!

Nurse: Oh but sir, which course would you like?

Majima: Huh? Oh, I don‚Äôt need a massage.

Nurse: What!? Won‚Äôt you get a massage while you‚Äôre here, sir!? Or did you put me through all that for nothing? After I broke every privacy protection rule in the book, too!

Majima: Tch, alright, alright! Gimme the quickest, shortest course ya got.

Nurse: Great! The 30 minute course, then! Tateyama-san‚Äôs the best in our store! Will she work for you, sir?

Majima: I don‚Äôt care either way, so up to you.

Nurse: Sure! We‚Äôll get set up for you, sir! Please undress and wait here.

[Some time later Majima is laying on the table.]

Nurse: Tateyama-san, can you take the customer in number one?

[An unexpected person enters the room!!!]

Makoto: Good afternoon! I‚Äôll be your masseuse today. I‚Äôm Makoto Tateyama. Nice to meet you, sir.

[Majima slowly turns his head, gets shocked and hides his face.]

Chapter 9: THE OMI INVASION
[Kiryu, Daigo and Kaoru talking at Serena.]

Daigo: The way they moved and handled their guns‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre not just some gang. They were more like a military.

Kiryu: That good?

[Kashiwagi bursts in.]

Kashiwagi: You okay, Daigo!?

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san!

Kashiwagi: You‚Äôre not hurt, are you?

Daigo: Sorry‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt protect Chairman Goda.

Kashiwagi: I heard. Don‚Äôt worry about it. You‚Äôre alive, that‚Äôs all that matters now. (offers him a cigarette) So, any clue who‚Äôs responsible for kidnapping you and Chairman Goda?

Daigo: I didn‚Äôt get much‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ they called themselves "The Jingweon."

Kashiwagi: You‚Äôre sure? The Jingweon Mafia?

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san, you‚Äôve heard of them?

Kashiwagi: Yeah‚Ä¶ But the Jingweon I know were wiped out.

Kaoru: I called HQ and asked them to search the records. They didn‚Äôt even have a record of their existence.

Kashiwagi: That‚Äôs because they‚Äôve been erased from the records.

Kaoru: Still, any mafia that big should turn up in police records somewhere.

Kashiwagi: The police are the ones who erased them.

Kaoru: But why?

[He plunges into memories‚Ä¶]

Kashiwagi: It happened over 20 years ago‚Ä¶ Back then, the Dojima Family stood against foreign factions all over Kamurocho. Of them, the Korean Jingweon Mafia was our biggest threat. The Dojima Family was already the Tojo Clan‚Äôs backbone, but to grow‚Ä¶ They needed a definitive strike.

Shimano: So‚Ä¶ We doin‚Äô this‚Ä¶ boss?

Dojima: Yeah‚Ä¶ Wipe ‚Äôem all out.

Kazama: All of them!?

Dojima: What? You got a problem with that?

Kazama: No‚Ä¶

Shimano: What, Kazama? A guy with a hundred kills is suddenly shittin‚Äô his pants?

Kazama: That‚Äôs not the issue! Boss‚Ä¶ Is war really the only option here?

Shimano: The fuck you smokin‚Äô, man!? They‚Äôre the ones who brought the fight! Kill us, we kill you harder. Welcome to the yakuza!

Dojima: Listen, Kazama‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt hear you.

Shimano: Boss‚Äî

Dojima: C‚Äômon, chill. Still‚Ä¶ These Jingweon fucks are different. Their methods are below the belt. If we don‚Äôt act, the Dojima Family‚Äôs good as done.

Kazama: Still‚Ä¶

Dojima: If we strike, it has to be now. Hit too soft, and we‚Äôve dug our own graves. They have to be wiped out. Am I clear?

Kazama: Yes. But is killing them all really necessary?

Shimano: Damn right! How many of my boys y‚Äôthink they‚Äôve buried? I wanna choke the life outta every last one of ‚Äôem!

Dojima: They‚Äôre operating behind a disco here in town. Tonight‚Äôs our only chance.

Shimano: Leave ‚Äôem to me!

Kazama: ‚Ä¶Fine.

Kashiwagi: Kazama-san was against it to the end. But if the boss says white is black, then black it is. In the end, Kazama-san went along with Shimano. They hit the Jingweon base and killed every last man. As a result, the Dojima Family took back Kamurocho, and became its de facto force. Not long after, Shimano split off to form his own family.

Daigo: So that‚Äôs how the Dojima Family came to power‚Ä¶

Kashiwagi: And not just the Dojima Family. The Tojo Clan used that momentum to spread all over Kanto.

Daigo: But if that‚Äôs all true, shouldn‚Äôt the Jingweon have been eradicated?

Kashiwagi: They were. The Jingweon Mafia was wiped out. But‚Ä¶ Maybe this means some of them lived after all.

Kaoru: Survivors of the raid?

Daigo: That would mean those survivors have allied with the Go-Ryu Clan.

Kiryu: Right.

Kaoru: But‚Ä¶ While all this was happening, where were the police?

Kashiwagi: The police didn‚Äôt have a solid lead on the Jingweon at the time. So they let the Dojima Family do their jobs for them.

Kaoru: Meaning‚Ä¶ They turned a blind eye?

Kashiwagi: That‚Äôs about the size of it. You‚Äôd have to ask the detective on the case for the details.

Kaoru: Oh really? You got a name?

Kashiwagi: I don‚Äôt remember his name. Like I said‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs been over 20 years‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Oh.

Kashiwagi: This is a hell of a mess‚Ä¶ Chairman Goda is still captive out there‚Ä¶ The Go-Ryu have their sights on Kamurocho‚Ä¶ And now the ghost of the Jingweon Mafia‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Plus the rat that set up Date-san.

Kashiwagi: It‚Äôs a crowded board‚Ä¶ Who‚Äôs going to make the next move?

Daigo: (puts out a cigarette) Doesn‚Äôt matter. Any way it goes down‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve got to beat it.

[Kiryu walks to Kashiwagi to talk to him.]

Kashiwagi: Tomorrow is Fifth Chairman Terada‚Äôs funeral service. Lady Dojima has been heading up the arrangement.

Kiryu: I see. I‚Äôll be there, then. I‚Äôd like to pay my final respect too.

Kashiwagi: Of course. I‚Äôll be a bit late, but I‚Äôll be there too. Once you‚Äôre settled in at HQ, make sure you update Lady Dojima on everything.

Kiryu: I will.

Kashiwagi: Thanks, Kiryu.

[He leaves. Kiryu walks to talk to Sayama.]

Kaoru: Sounds like tomorrow‚Äôs another busy day. Shall we call it a night?

Kiryu: You‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs get some rest.

Kaoru: All right. Plan on getting woken up bright and early.

Kiryu: Thanks.

[The next day.]

Kaoru: Mornin‚Äô. You‚Äôre going to the fifth chairman‚Äôs funeral today, yeah? I‚Äôll use the time to touch base with Osaka PD. I‚Äôll be out for a while.

Kiryu: Take your time.

Kaoru: I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt have to say it‚Ä¶ but try to stay out of trouble, okay?

Kiryu: Yeah, I‚Äôll do my best. I‚Äôll call you when I get back.

Kaoru: Now you‚Äôre getting it.

Kiryu: (I‚Äôll catch a cab when I‚Äôm ready to head to the funeral.)

Go to Tojo Clan Headquarters
[Kiryu changes clothes, catches a cab and goes to the Tojo Clan‚Äôs office. He enters the memorial room with the coffin.]

Kiryu: (Terada‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just like when I lost Kazama-san. I‚Äôm left here to wonder how it was you and not me. I guess I‚Äôve got more to accomplish first.)

[The ceremony begins.]

Yayoi: (to Daigo) If the Jingweon Mafia and the Go-Ryu Clan really are working together‚Ä¶ There‚Äôll be no avoiding bloodshed.

Kiryu: Our first priority is finding Chairman Goda.

Daigo: If we establish the alliance, the Go-Ryu get their hands tied.

[Voices come from the next room.]

Yakuza: Hey! Who the hell are they!?

Yakuza 2: What the fuck!?

[Kiryu, Daigo and Yayoi run there. The patriarch of the Nishiyama Family smiles.]

Kiryu: (What the hell is going on!?)

[He runs out into the courtyard.]

Daigo: What the hell is this?

[A lot of black Mercedes drive into the courtyard, out of which the Yakuza come out.]

Daigo: Go-Ryu scum!?

Yakuza Boss: Step aside, dinky! We meet again, Kiryu-han.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre not taking another step further.

Yakuza Boss: Ryuji-san ain‚Äôt here today. So me n‚Äô the boys came to bury yer sorry ass! Wreck ‚Äôim!

[Kiryu and Daigo crush them. For Daigo though the fight appears to be not that easy. He falls on one knee.]

Yayoi: Daigo!

Kashiwagi: The Go-Ryu Clan?

Kiryu: Yeah.

[New cars are coming up. Ryuji gets out of one of them in a traditional Japanese costume.]

Daigo: Ryuji Goda!

Ryuji: Mornin‚Äô, Kiryu-han.

Kiryu: Who starts a fight in the middle of a funeral?

Ryuji: My boys get so damn fired up sometimes‚Ä¶ I tell ‚Äôem to cool it, but it‚Äôs in one ear, out the next. It ain‚Äôt right, I know.

Kashiwagi: You dare to show your face here!?

Ryuji: Terada-han did right by me as a kid. Thought I‚Äôd come pay my respects.

Kashiwagi: Your "respects" mean less than nothing! Get the hell out!

Ryuji: That‚Äôs a helluva scowl ya got there. Who are ya now?

Kashiwagi: Acting clan captain, Kashiwagi.

Ryuji: (claps) No shit!? Here I was thinkin‚Äô ya were with the funeral staff! Well, can ya blame me, considerin‚Äô how thin the Tojo Clan‚Äôs lookin‚Äô now? Even yer dead chairman got plucked from the other team. And his replacement‚Äôs the ol‚Äô black widow here‚Ä¶ Thinkin‚Äô this is what I‚Äôm up against, hell, I almost wanna cry.

Daigo: Chairman Terada‚Äôs only gone‚Ä¶ Because you killed him, asshole!

[Daigo is trying to punch Ryuji, but he easily dodges and kicks him. Daigo falls to the ground.]

Ryuji: C‚Äômon now, bud. Where‚Äôd all your spunk go?

Daigo: Son of a bitch‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll kill you!

Kiryu: (stops Daigo) Where is Chairman Goda?

Ryuji: Taking a little vacation. Up where the air‚Äôs nice and clean.

Daigo: You‚Äôre trying to stop the alliance?

Ryuji: ‚ÄôCourse. The world-renowned Omi Alliance and this wobbly-ass clan shakin‚Äô hands? That ain‚Äôt level.

Kashiwagi: Bastard‚Ä¶ So you came for a fight!?

Ryuji: No, no, no, good sir. For real, I came to offer some incense for Terada-han. My humanity‚Äôs as good as yours‚Ä¶ And I wouldn‚Äôt make trouble at a funeral. This shit‚Äôs sacred.

[He snaps his fingers. Two yakuza walks in carrying suitcases full of money.]

Ryuji: Please, with my condolences.

Kashiwagi: We don‚Äôt need any Go-Ryu money!

Ryuji: Didn‚Äôt the Tojo Clan damn near fall apart over a measly 10 bil last year? If money‚Äôs really that tight, I suggest ya scoop it on up.

Yayoi: You think childish taunts like this make you man enough to be the sixth Omi chairman?

Ryuji: You‚Äôre really the acting chairman?

Yayoi: Were I in Chairman Goda‚Äôs shoes, I‚Äôd be the one crying.

Ryuji: Whatchya implyin‚Äô by that, grams?

Yayoi: A parent loves their kids, no matter how far they fall. That said, when your flesh and blood is this rotten, all a parent feels is unrelenting shame!

Ryuji: (laughs) I ain‚Äôt the old man‚Äôs flesh and blood.

Yayoi: What!?

Ryuji: So fuck off with the "parental love" shit. All we got is lots o‚Äô hate, and it‚Äôs mutual. Ya got it rough, bud. Yer ma‚Äôs a real battle-axe.

Daigo: Fuck you!

Ryuji: That‚Äôs enough fun for today though. I ain‚Äôt wanted here, so I‚Äôll see myself out. Oh, right. Three days.

Kiryu: Three days?

Ryuji: Yeah, I‚Äôm givin‚Äô us three days to mourn the dead. When the third day‚Äôs up, it‚Äôs rematch time.

Kiryu: You want a rematch?

Ryuji: Sure do. But if ya don‚Äôt wanna beat around the bush, we can settle it now. It‚Äôs gonna rain blood over Kamurocho. Which reminds me, wonder what that dirty bastard‚Äôs up to? He‚Äôs probably here in Kamurocho now, makin‚Äô a big ol‚Äô show of it.

Kiryu: Dirty bastard? Who?

Ryuji: Sengoku.

Kiryu: Sengoku‚Ä¶

[The scene ends. In the next scene several helicopters hover over Kamurocho, confusing the inhabitants. A yakuza gang walks down a Kamurocho street. Majima gets in their way.]

Yakuza Boss: Who the fuck is this clown!?

[Majima pulls out his tanto and attacks the yakuza with a crazy laugh. Meanwhile, Kiryu is walking down the street. His phone rings.]

Kaoru: Hello?

Kiryu: Sayama. Sorry, I got too tied up to call you.

Kaoru: I got the gist of what happened already. The Omi Alliance have launched their attack?

Kiryu: Yeah, Sengoku, specifically.

Kaoru: Wait, just Sengoku? Why?

Kiryu: Can we talk later? There‚Äôs a lot going on at the moment.

Kaoru: Where are you?

Kiryu: Near Purgatory.

Kaoru: I‚Äôm nearby anyway. Just give me a sec and I‚Äôll be there.

[They meet up.]

Kaoru: So what‚Äôs going on?   

Kiryu: All I‚Äôve got to go on at the moment is what Ryuji said.

Kaoru: Wait, Ryuji came out here too?

Kiryu: Yeah. The Go-Ryu attacked Tojo Clan Headquarters. We beat them back, but he said he didn‚Äôt even order it‚Ä¶ And if what he‚Äôs saying is true, then Sengoku‚Äôs attack was independent of the Go-Ryu Clan.

Kaoru: Seems like the whole Omi Alliance has gone rogue‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Maybe, but our first priority needs to be pushing Sengoku back.

Kaoru: Right. Let‚Äôs hurry.

[Kiryu and Kaoru investigate the city. They find Majima barely alive.]

Kiryu: Majima-san!

Majima: Too late, Kiryu-chan‚Ä¶ I already smeared all o‚Äô Sengoku‚Äôs girls.

[He falls on the asphalt.]

Kiryu: Majima!

Majima: Promise is a promise, right? I‚Ä¶ kept it.

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶Yeah.

Majima: As fer you‚Ä¶ Ya gotta get back to Tojo HQ!

Kiryu: Why‚Äôs that?

Majima: All those ‚Äôcopters flyin‚Äô around town and these fools marchin‚Äô in‚Ä¶ It was all to lure ya out, Kiryu-chan. Their real goal‚Ä¶ was HQ. They‚Äôre movin‚Äô on it.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre serious!?

Majima: Yeah‚Ä¶ Sengoku has a rat on the inside‚Ä¶ Shindo.

Kiryu: Shindo!?

Majima: That fuckwad‚Ä¶ He sold out. So get goin‚Äô, Kiryu-chan!

Kaoru: I can take care of him!

[She runs to Majima and holds him.]

Majima: (flirting) Y‚Äôknow, up close‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre pretty damn hot. Wanna go out some‚Äî

Kaoru: Oh, shut up! No more talking!

Kiryu: He‚Äôs in your hands.

Kaoru: Yeah.

Kiryu: (I need to get back to Tojo Clan HQ!)

Go to Tojo Clan Headquarters
[Kiryu runs to Tojo HQ. There‚Äôs a lot of bodies in the courtyard and kicks asses of the Nishikiyama Family yakuzas inside. He rushes to the meeting room where some yakuza takas Daigo and Kashiwagi and other patriarchs hostage.]

Yayoi: Don‚Äôt think for a second you‚Äôll get away with this!

Shindo: I‚Äôm afraid I already have.

Kiryu: Yayoi-san!

Shindo: I got quite a bit done while you were out.

Kiryu: So you‚Äôve sold out to Sengoku?

Shindo: (laughs) As it stands, the Tojo Clan‚Äôs on its last legs.

Yayoi: You think a boor like you can shake the Tojo Clan!?

Shindo: No, but what‚Äôs that I hear? The sound of the Tojo Clan, changing‚Ä¶ As we speak, Sengoku‚Äôs hitmen are wiping out the other officers.

Kiryu: What!?

[The scene switches to the three yakuza in the elevator.]

Tojo Clan Boss: Kamurocho may be infested with Sengoku‚Äôs men, but today‚Äôs the fifth chairman‚Äôs funeral. I want all your men to stand down. Is that clear?

Tojo Clan Yakuza: Yes, sir.

[When they get off the elevator, the two killers shoot them with guns. Later, another patriarch of Tojo is killed with a shotgun, and then another is blown up in his own car.]

Kiryu: Have you no shame!? The Tojo Clan stood by you‚Ä¶ And you handed it over for money!

Shindo: I never said anything about handing it over. I‚Äôm taking over as chairman. And finally‚Ä¶ Yayoi-san will be mine.

Yayoi: What do you mean by that!?

Shindo: You know, my lady‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve wanted you for a while now!

[He kisses Yayoi and she slaps his mug.]

Shindo: It‚Äôs not like you can escape me.

Kiryu: Do you have any idea what you‚Äôve done!?

Shindo: Didn‚Äôt you and Patriarch Nishikiyama go to war over a woman just last year? And as a result, the Tojo Clan went all to hell. I guess at the end of the day, we‚Äôre both skunks of the same stripe.

Yayoi: It‚Äôll be a cold day in hell before I‚Äôd be with you!

Shindo: Patriarch Dojima had a mistress on every corner‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd make you happier than that toad ever could!

Yayoi: You don‚Äôt know a damn thing about him! Even if he did have his women‚Ä¶ Sohei Dojima was the only man I ever had eyes for! He may be gone now, but that changes nothing!

Kiryu: Shindo! You heard her. She‚Äôs only ever loved the man she fell for. She‚Äôs too strong for you.

Shindo: That‚Äôs lovely, but let‚Äôs cut the crap. What I want, I take by force. It‚Äôs just that easy.

Kiryu: Over my dead body‚Ä¶

Shindo: That‚Äôs certainly the plan. With your head, I‚Äôll become Tojo Clan chairman. And then‚Ä¶ Yayoi-san will be all mine!

[They have an epic fight all over the Tojo HQ! Kiryu slays Shindo with a katana!]

Yayoi: Are you all right?

Kiryu: Yes.

Yayoi: Let‚Äôs go check on Daigo and Kashiwagi. Come on.

[They return to the meeting room. Shindo, who appeared to be dead, attacks Kiryu from behind! Kiryu finishes him off with a nifty chair strike!]

Yayoi: Our ties are cut with you! Get the hell out of my sight!

[Barely alive Shindo stretches his arm for a gun‚Ä¶ Daigo notices it and quickly shoots the bastard.]

Daigo: Your greed damn near fucked over the clan! Die, you son of a bitch!

[He shots Shindo dead.]

Yayoi: I‚Äôm so ashamed‚Ä¶ I let a man like Shindo put a blade to my neck‚Ä¶

Kashiwagi: Acting Chairman, my deepest apologies!

Yayoi: It‚Äôs not your fault. An outside threat is a visible danger. But when it comes from within, you never see it coming. But listen well, and tell your families. There will be no mercy for any Omi men in Kamurocho. I want them out of our city!

Kiryu, Kashiwagi and Daigo: Understood!

Chapter 10: SURVIVORS
[Date reads some papers in the police archive.]

Date: Here we go. What? The Dojima Family wiped out the Jingweon?

[Kawara enters.]

Kawara: Make any progress, Makoto?

Date: God, Kawara-san‚Ä¶ Scared the crap outta me.

Kawara: My bad. I just took a peek outside. No one‚Äôs onto you, yet anyway.

Date: Not like Archive 13 gets a whole lot of traffic these days.

Kawara: So you finally hit the Foreign Affairs file. Figured you would.

[Date closes the file he reads. On the cover it says ‚é°Á•ûÂÆ§Áî∫Êµ∑Â§ñ„Éû„Éï„Ç£„Ç¢Â§ßÈáèÊéíÈô§‚é¶„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÂ†±ÂëäÊõ∏ that roughly translates ‚ÄúReport on Overseas Mafia Mass Elimination in Kamurocho.‚Äù]

Date: Wait, you knew about this?

Kawara: Yep. Flip to the last page there.

[Date opens the file again and does not turn pages until it finds a table. In the top center column it says Ê∞èÂêç (Full name). In the left column we can read Ë≠¶Ë¶ñÂ∫ÅÁ•ûÂÆ§ÁΩ≤ ‰∫ã‰ª∂ÊêúÊü•Â†±Âëä (Office of the Commissioner of Kamuro Metropolitan Police Department, Incident Investigation Report) Êò≠Âíå‰∫îÂçÅÂÖ≠Âπ¥ÂÖ´ÊúàÂçÅÊó• (August 10, 1956 (Showa period). In the center column - Áì¶ Ê¨°ÈÉé(Ë≠¶ËßÜÂéÖÊêúÊü•‰∏ÄË™≤ÊâÄÂ±û) {Jiro Kawara (member of Police Department‚Äôs Division 1)} and Âà•ÊâÄ Âã§(ÁÆ°Ë¶ñÂ∫è Á•ûÂÆ§ÁΩ≤ÊêúÊü•ÂõõË™≤ÊâÄÂ±û) {Tsutomu Bessho (member of Kamuro Police Department‚Äôs Division 4)}. And finally in the right column we can read ÊãÖÂΩìÊêúÊü•ÂÆò (Acting officers).]

Date: You and Bessho-san from Osaka PD!?

Kawara: Right. It was our case.

Date: Lemme guess‚Ä¶ This is why you‚Äôre on this case now?

Kawara: Yeah. I heard through the grapevine Kurahashi was tracking the Jingweon and volunteered.

Date: Why?

Kawara: I owe them for that case.

Date: Owe them?

[Kawara throws his badge on the table.]

Kawara: Looks like my work here is done. The rest is up to you.

Date: What do you mean?

Kawara: I‚Äôm done answering questions.

Date: Kawara-san!

[Kawara walks out of the archive. Date meets Kaoru and Kiryu on some roof.]

Kaoru: The chief was on the original Jingweon case? So the detective Kashiwagi-san mentioned was‚Ä¶.

Date: Right. It was Bessho-san.

Kaoru: You‚Äôre sure?

Date: Absolutely. His name was right there in the report. And Kawara-san corroborated it.

Kaoru: He never‚Ä¶ The chief never even brought it up.

Kiryu: Where‚Äôs Kawara-san?

Date: (pulls out Kawara‚Äôs badge) He gave me this and dropped off the case.

Kiryu: What does that mean?

Date: I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm sure the old man knows something. Says he still owes them one.

Kiryu: Owes them? (sees Kaoru‚Äôs worried face) What‚Äôs wrong?

Kaoru: He lied to me‚Ä¶ How could the chief hide this?

Date: The report said he picked up on the Dojima plan while in Kamurocho‚Äôs Division Four. But‚Ä¶ He looked the other way and allowed it.

Kaoru: In other words, he used the yakuza‚Ä¶

Date: If I had to guess, he figured it was the best way to make Kamurocho safe again. Eventually the brass caught wind of it though, so they booted him down to Osaka.

Kiryu: You should probably bow out too, Date-san. The Jingweon aren‚Äôt your average mob. They‚Äôre out for blood. Not to mention you‚Äôre a wanted man.

Date: You nuts? You think I can just drop this now? Anyway, what‚Äôll you do next?

Kiryu: We still don‚Äôt know where Chairman Goda is. I‚Äôll go after Ryuji‚Ä¶ To Kansai.

[They return to the streets.]

Kaoru: So we‚Äôve both got business in Kansai, right?

Kiryu: Yeah, I‚Äôm worried about Chairman Goda.

Kaoru: All right. Well, I need to get my stuff. Meet me back at Serena later.

Kiryu: No problem.

Kaoru: I‚Äôll call you when I‚Äôm ready. See you then.

[Kiryu uses his free time to eat and rest. When he enters the Theater Square he is greeted by a young guy.]

Young Guy:Kiryu-san‚Ä¶? Wait, is that you, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Aren‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ Takashi?

Takashi: Right. Um‚Ä¶ Thank you so much‚Ä¶ For everything. (bows)

[Kiryu recalls his last encounter with Takashi in the first game.]

Kiryu: (offscreen) Almost exactly a year ago‚Ä¶ I helped the Florist‚Äôs son, Takashi, out of a bind. Takashi had gotten romantically involved with Kyoka, the daughter of the Atobe Family patriarch.

Takashi‚Äôs Girl: C‚Äômon, Takashi! What are we standin‚Äô around for? Didn‚Äôt you say if you won big at the tracks that tonight would be your treat?

Kiryu: And who‚Äôs this? Where‚Äôs Kyoka?

Takashi: O-Oh, th-this is‚Ä¶

Kiryu: So much for doing whatever it takes to make Kyoka happy, huh?

Takashi: Th-That‚Äôs‚Ä¶

Kiryu: In the end, you were just another punk‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs not true, Kiryu-san! Please, just hear me out!

[They go to a bar to talk.]

Takashi: I was working my ass off! Gas stations, restaurants, construction jobs. I‚Äôve given every job my best effort‚Ä¶ Still‚Ä¶ no matter where I went, I didn‚Äôt seem to fit in. I never lasted long. Then money got tight, and I‚Ä¶

Kiryu: (sighs) Didn‚Äôt you tell me once you‚Äôd do whatever it takes to protect Kyoka? You were ready to chop off a finger to prove it, too. Was that just a bunch of hot air?

Takashi: But‚Ä¶ Kyoka is‚Ä¶

Kiryu: What about her?

Takashi: She‚Äôs‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs meeting with another guy behind my back.

Kiryu: What? You‚Äôre sure about that?

Takashi: I asked her once, and she lied about being out with friends. But I know there‚Äôs something going on. One of my coworkers at my last job saw it firsthand. He told me he saw Kyoka go into a hotel with another guy.

Kiryu: Hm.

Takashi: Kyoka‚Äôs leaving me out to dry, and I‚Äôm the one struggling to work‚Ä¶

Kiryu: (sighs) You‚Äôre pathetic. You can‚Äôt even confirm it yourself. All you have to go on is what someone else told you. You‚Äôre scared of the truth.

Takashi: Scared of the truth‚Ä¶?

Kiryu: Exactly.

Takashi: Kiryu-san, have you ever heard the rumor about the legendary information dealer here in Kamurocho? They say he has eyes everywhere in this city. Is this true? If anyone would know, it‚Äôs you. You‚Äôve gotta tell me, Kiryu-san.

No idea.
All right, I‚Äôll tell you. +

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶They call him the Florist. The Florist of Sai.

Takashi: Please‚Ä¶ Will you take me to him? I have to know what Kyoka is really doing.

Kiryu: If I take you, it‚Äôll be on his terms. I‚Äôll talk to the Florist for you, but no promises.

Takashi: Thank you.

Go to the Millennium Tower
[Kiryu goes up to the 5th floor to meet with his favorite fat informator.]

Kiryu: Florist‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs your son. Takashi wants to meet you. But the question is, are you willing to meet with him?

The Florist: Pah. You said it yourself. He‚Äôs pathetic. No backbone in this kid. Not a trait he picked up from me, that‚Äôs for sure.

Kiryu: That‚Äôs your answer, then?

The Florist: I don‚Äôt even want to look at him.

Kiryu: Hm. No backbone, huh? Maybe the apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree.

The Florist: Hey, it‚Äôs just not my thing.

Kiryu: I guess we‚Äôre done here then.

The Florist: Wait. Takashi‚Ä¶ The kid just wants to talk to the Florist, right?

Kiryu: Yeah, he does.

The Florist: Then that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll meet him as. Bring him on up.

Kiryu: All right.

The Florist: Hey, was that a smirk?

Kiryu: Nah. Somewhere deep down, you want to meet this kid, I think.

The Florist: Mind your own damn business. Just bring the little shit in.

[Kiryu returns to the bar.]

Takashi: Oh hey, Kiryu-san! How‚Äôd it go?

Kiryu: He‚Äôs got a minute he can spare you. Let‚Äôs head up.

Takashi: Wow, really!?

[They return to The Florist.]

Kiryu: Takashi, this is the Florist.

Takashi: I‚Ä¶ my name is Takashi.

The Florist: I don‚Äôt need your life story, kid. You know how busy I am?

Takashi: Then you already know why‚Ä¶?

The Florist: You want the dirt on the girl you eloped with, right?

Takashi: I just need to know what Kyoka is doing‚Ä¶

The Florist: I didn‚Äôt ask for your reasons. You‚Äôre in the market for info I happen to be selling. That‚Äôs all it is. Got it?

Takashi: Yes‚Ä¶

The Florist: So, one more time. You want info on this chick you ran off with?

Takashi: Yes.

The Florist: Once you know the truth, there‚Äôs no going back. Sure you won‚Äôt regret it?

Takashi: I‚Äôm sure. No matter what I find out, I‚Äôll deal with it. I can take it.

The Florist: All right, then.

Takashi: Hm.

[The Florist pushes a few buttons.]

The Florist: This footage is about a week old.

[Kyoka is on her phone on the video.]

Kyoka: Hello? It‚Äôs me. Uh huh‚Ä¶ Yeah‚Ä¶ Then you‚Äôll meet me? Okay, got it. Takashi‚Äôs out right now, so it‚Äôll be fine. All right. The usual spot, then.

Takashi: Dammit‚Ä¶ Kyoka!

[Kyoka walks in a hotel named ‚ÄúBeauty.‚Äù]

Kyoka: (waving to someone) I‚Äôm over here!

Takashi: (crying) No more, please. I don‚Äôt need to see anymore‚Ä¶

The Florist: You asked for this. Watch and deal with it.

[An old man walks to Kyoka.]

Takashi: Wait‚Ä¶

[The old man hands Kyoka an envelope with money.]

Kyoka (on video): Dad‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry about this.

Kyoka‚Äôs Father (on video):That man of yours‚Ä¶ He quit yet another job?

Kyoka (on video): It wasn‚Äôt Takashi‚Äôs fault, though!

Kyoka‚Äôs Father (on video): It was too soon for you two. Look‚Ä¶ Why not call things off? You know you can come home any time, don‚Äôt you?

Kyoka (on video): Thank you, Dad. But I‚Ä¶ I believe in Takashi. He‚Äôs still finding his footing right now‚Ä¶ But he‚Äôll come around. So I want to support him until he does.

Kyoka‚Äôs Father (on video): Stubborn as ever‚Ä¶ Who could you have gotten that from?

Kyoka (on video): Once Takashi settles into a new job, we‚Äôll pay you back, no matter how long it takes!

Kyoka‚Äôs Father (on video): I expect nothing from that kid. It just kills me to see you live like this. You deserve better.

Takashi: (crying) Kyoka, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm such a‚Ä¶

The Florist: The waterworks won‚Äôt solve your problems, kid.

Takashi: Both of you‚Ä¶ Thank you. I know you guys probably think I‚Äôm full of it, but I‚Äôm gonna keep working at this. I‚Äôll work as hard as I can. I promise‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll make Kyoka happy‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Actions speak louder than words. Go back to Kyoka, Takashi.

Takashi: Right!

The Florist: And land a stable job, huh? No more running away when it gets tough.

Takashi: Right!

The Florist: Your father would be ashamed of you right now.

Takashi: What do you know about my dad?

The Florist: I‚Äôm an information dealer. What don‚Äôt I know about your dad?

Takashi: Would you be able to find out about him, then? Where he is now? What he‚Äôs doing? If he‚Äôs even still alive?

The Florist: There‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt find out.

Takashi: Mr. Florist‚Ä¶ Can you track down my father?

The Florist: You got the cash?

Takashi: What?

The Florist: My fee. Can you pay it?

Takashi: H-How much would it be?

The Florist: More than your sorry ass can afford, that‚Äôs for sure. No use quoting it. When you can actually support yourself and that girl, you come see me again. Maybe then we‚Äôll talk like men.

Takashi: What do I owe you for this time, then?

The Florist: This one‚Äôs going on my tab with Kiryu. I still owe him a few.

Takashi: Thank you.

Kiryu: Thank him, not me.

Takashi: Thank you, Kiryu-san. Really, thank you.

[He leaves.]

Kiryu: Heh, you‚Äôre an impressive father.

The Florist: Father my ass. That was strictly professional.

Kiryu: Since when do you work pro bono?

The Florist: Shut up. Like I said, we‚Äôre square now.

[Kiryu leaves the Millennium Tower and gets a call from Kaoru.]

Kaoru: I‚Äôm ready to go. I‚Äôll wait for you at Serena. okay?

Kiryu: All right. I‚Äôll be right there.

[He goes to Serena.]

Kaoru: Took you long enough.

[She‚Äôs loading a small revolver.]

Kiryu: What‚Äôs wrong? Planning on using that?

Kaoru: Can‚Äôt trust anyone anymore‚Ä¶ The chief never once told me he used to work in Kamurocho. I trusted him this whole time.

Kiryu: It‚Äôs not like Bessho betrayed you.

Kaoru: Yes he did! You‚Äôve got no idea how hard I worked to get into Division Four. I thought he was the one guy who had my back. Turns out he was making deals with yakuza behind my back. Sorry for the detour, but we‚Äôve gotta stop in at Osaka PD. Getting to the bottom of the Jingweon comes first.

Kiryu: Do what you want. I need to find Chairman Goda.

[Kaoru aims her revolver at Kiryu.]

Kaoru: You don‚Äôt get it. You‚Äôre still in my custody. You don‚Äôt get a choice here. We clear?

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶Fine.

[In the next scene they fly on a plane to Osaka after which come to a place Ë≠¶ÂØüÊú¨ÈÉ®Â∫ÅÂëä (Osaka Police Headquarters) and walks in ÂèñË™øÂÆ§ (Interrogation Room).]

Bessho: Sorry, we‚Äôre full up on rooms right now. But this‚Äôll do for a little chat, right? So, what can I do ya for?

Kaoru: Some odd 20 years back, the Dojima Family took on the Jingweon Mafia for control of Kamurocho. It was your case, wasn‚Äôt it?

Bessho: What is this, an interrogation? Yeah, I was on the case. What of it?

Kaoru: Chief, the Millennium Tower bombing, the kidnapping of Jin Goda and Daigo Dojima‚Ä¶ It looks like the Jingweon are involved. I‚Äôll ask you straight‚Ä¶ There anything you wanna share?

Bessho: Nope.

Kaoru: But‚Ä¶

Bessho: Chill out a sec. All I know is what went down back then. No way I could know what‚Äôs happenin‚Äô now.

Kaoru: Fine, but then why didn‚Äôt you tell me about the Jingweon!?

Bessho: I had no idea there was a connection, so I‚Äôm not gonna just spill classified intel. A bad lead‚Äôs worse than no lead.

Kaoru: That‚Äôs your only reason?

Bessho: Yup.

Kaoru: Fine. Then can you tell us what you know about the case 20 years ago?

Bessho: No prob. Where to even start? This is probably old news, but I was up in Kamurocho‚Äôs Division Four.

Kaoru: I heard. And you made the Dojima Family do your job.

Bessho: Well it ain‚Äôt that simple‚Ä¶ But yeah, it was the only way. Cops couldn‚Äôt do a damn thing. We couldn‚Äôt find shit on ‚Äôem. Daily lootin‚Äô and beatings had folks scared bad. When the Jingweon hit Kamurocho, the city went to hell faster than we could react.

Kaoru: But cutting deals with yakuza behind the scenes is never the right call. It only leads to corruption. Wasn‚Äôt that practically your motto!?

Bessho: There was no other way at the time.

Kaoru: I‚Äôll change the question. The Jingweon are doing all right for an extinct mafia. Any ideas there? You know something, don‚Äôt you?

Bessho: At the time, the Jingweon Mafia was a 36-man outfit. Of that, we only found 33 bodies.

Kiryu: Meaning three survivors.

Bessho: Right. I know about one of ‚Äôem.

Kaoru: Who is it? Please, tell me, Chief!

Bessho: A place called "Keima" out in the city. You‚Äôll find him there.

Kaoru: His name?

Bessho: These days he goes by "Murai."

Kaoru: Murai, you said?

Bessho: Sayama‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm the one who brought Murai to Osaka. I gave ‚Äôim the name Murai.

Kaoru: What?

Bessho: It‚Äôs a miracle he survived. The Jingweon creed is "death before dishonor." Revenge comes before stayin‚Äô alive for them. Murai broke that creed. So I helped ‚Äôim get outta Kamurocho.

Kiryu: To shield him from the retribution of the others?

Bessho: Exactly. Kawara and I brought ‚Äòim with us when we got transferred to Kansai.

Kiryu: Kawara-san got transferred to Kansai too?

Bessho: Sayama‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Yeah?

Bessho: Yer protective custody job ends today.

Kaoru: What!?

Bessho: That‚Äôs an order.

Kaoru: And why‚Äôs that!?

Bessho: If the Jingweon are involved, this thing‚Äôs gotten way too dangerous.

Kaoru: Wait‚Ä¶ Is this some chauvinist BS?

Bessho: Hell no. It ain‚Äôt like that. It‚Äôs just outside Division Four‚Äôs jurisdiction.

Kaoru: Don‚Äôt play that card now! My job is bringing criminals to justice!

Bessho: This ain‚Äôt just another yakuza hunt!

Kaoru: They‚Äôre still just people!

Bessho: (hits the table) Only reason ya can say that is ‚Äôcause you ain‚Äôt seen the Jingweon‚Äôs work. Even women and children are just more meat for the fire!

Kaoru: But‚Ä¶ I‚Äî

Bessho: I said that‚Äôs an order, goddammit!

[Kaoru leaves the room in rage.]

Bessho: Stubborn as hell, that one. Look out for her, would ya? You‚Äôre probably the only one who can. (bes) Please‚Ä¶

Kiryu: I had a question for you, too.

Bessho: Oh yeah?

Kiryu: You know about Kawara-san‚Äôs shootings. Are those related to the Dojima-Jingweon incident in some way? ‚Ä¶And to the transfer to Kansai?

Bessho: Look, I‚Äôve already said too much. Just take good care of Sayama, would ya?

[Kiryu walks out of the police building.]

Kiryu: (I wonder where she ran off to? I should check in with her.)

[He goes to Aoi Bar.]

Tamiyo: Welcome to‚Ä¶ Oh, it‚Äôs you, sugar. If it‚Äôs Kaoru you‚Äôre after, she ain‚Äôt here.

Kiryu: Where is she?

Tamiyo: Dunno what‚Äôs got her down, but I think she‚Äôs out drinkin‚Äô at one of those bars again. She ducks into a bar and drowns her sorrows that way. They all know her by name, but I couldn‚Äôt tell ya which one.

Kiryu: I can think of a few bars she might be at. I‚Äôll check around.

[He goes to Stijl.]

Kiryu: Is there a woman named Sayama here?

Staff: Oh, Kaoru-san? She left not long ago. Said she was headin‚Äô out to the river‚Ä¶ Maybe she‚Äôs hopin‚Äô to relax a little?

Kiryu: Okay, thanks.

[Catching a strange feeling Kiryu runs to the river. Meanwhile some punks are harassing a girl on the riverbank. Kaoru notices it.]

Kaoru: What the hell are you punks doin‚Äô!?

Punk: Hey, baby! Somethin‚Äô ya wanna say?

Kaoru: (flashes her badge) Whaddaya think comes next if ya try anything? (to the girl) Get outta here.

[The girl is saved and Kaoru walks away.]

Punk: Hold on!

Kaoru: What now?

Punk: Damn, girl‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre lightin‚Äô the fire under my heart!

Kaoru: And I‚Äôm s‚Äôposed to care?

Punk: Well‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre one hot babe, y‚Äôknow? How ‚Äôbout givin‚Äô me n‚Äô the boys some a‚Äô that?

Kaoru: Ya think that gross crap‚Äôs funny!?

Punk: I‚Äôm dead serious, baby! Bangin‚Äô a cop would be some kinky shit‚Ä¶

Kaoru: One more word and I‚Äôm bustin‚Äô all of ya.

Punk: Ooh‚Ä¶ That pouty face does it for me‚Ä¶

[One of the punks attacks Kaoru but she throws him in the river to cool off. Also she slaps the leader of the punks.]

Punk: I love a woman who can put up a fight‚Ä¶

[He slaps Kaoru and she falls on the ground. Suddenly someone touches his shoulder.]

Punk: Who the fuck are you?

[Kiryu punches the bastard.]

Kiryu: I‚Äôm her bodyguard.

Punk: (laughs) Looks like we gotta work for our fun, boys!

[Kiryu kicks their sorry asses. They run away. Kiryu helps Kaoru to stand up. Some policeman runs in.]

Policeman: Hey, what‚Äôs going on!? Stop!

[Kaoru grabs Kiryu‚Äôs hand.]

Kaoru: Come on!

[They run into some alley.]

Policeman: Where‚Äôd they go?

Kaoru: (releases Kiryu‚Äôs hand) S-Sorry.

Kiryu: It‚Äôs okay.

[Kaoru chickles.]

Kiryu: What‚Äôs so funny?

Kaoru: Nothin‚Äô, just you n‚Äô me‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs pretty crazy.

Kiryu: Hm?

Kaoru: Hey‚Ä¶ You free tonight?

Kiryu: Huh? Yeah.

Kaoru: I feel like goin‚Äô out. Care to join me?

[They walk around the city for some time and go to eat some takoyaki.]

Kaoru: C‚Äômon, pick up the pace!

[Grabs a ball and quickly eats it. They play golf together‚Ä¶ Kaoru broke a club.]

Staff: Hey!

[They run away like children. After that they play an UFO Catcher. Kiryu wins a bear for Kaoru and went out late into the night. In the next scene we find Kiryu standing on the roof smoking a cigarette. Kaoru enters.]

Kaoru: Sorry for the wait. Musta been a run on beer tonight.

Kiryu: No prob. It‚Äôs a great view of the city.

[They open a cold one and take a sip.]

Kaoru: Ah, that hits the spot.

Kiryu: Isn‚Äôt this your second round today?

Kaoru: Well, nothin‚Äô beats a stiff drink after a workout!

Kiryu: Pretty great spot.

Kaoru: I know, right? It‚Äôs nice up here. My treat for comin‚Äô out with me. I don‚Äôt usually take people to my secret spot, y‚Äôknow. Consider yourself lucky!

[Kiryu and Kaoru drink a few Premium Malt‚Äôs.]

Kiryu: I‚Äôm feeling pretty good.

Kaoru: Still thirsty? I‚Äôll buy.

Kiryu: Hm? Thanks‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre so considerate.

Kaoru: Flattery won‚Äôt get ya nothin‚Äô but another beer, buddy.

Kiryu: Well, it‚Äôs true.

Kaoru: Get outta here. Ya take me for the kinda girl who falls for one-liners like that?

Kiryu: I was just calling it how I see it.

Kaoru: Like I said, flattery‚Äôs not earnin‚Äô ya any brownie points.

Kiryu: It‚Äôs kind of cute how you fight every compliment.

Kaoru: Wha‚Äî Oh pleaaase. Nobody‚Äôs ever called me crap like "kind" or "cute" before. I‚Äôm tougher than half the force‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre terrified of me. In other words, I know flattery when I hear it. I didn‚Äôt drag ya up here so you could try n‚Äô put on the charm‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Those other guys just don‚Äôt see it.

Kaoru: What, exactly?

Kiryu: That you‚Äôre a cop, but a woman too. Don‚Äôt let them tear you down. In life, I think the most important part is to just be yourself.

Kaoru: Well, I s‚Äôpose.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre pushing back so hard against everything around you right now. Maybe you‚Äôve kinda lost yourself in the process? I guarantee, someone‚Äôs going to see the real you and cherish you for it. You okay?

Kaoru: Shall we? I‚Äôve had one too many. Ya know‚Ä¶ I gave up on findin‚Äô that kinda happiness. I got nothin‚Äô against romance, but‚Ä¶ But thinkin‚Äô this way got me this far. Made me who I am today. Not that anybody‚Äôd know how I feel‚Ä¶ Nobody but me.

Kiryu: (stands up) Yeah, you‚Äôre right.

Kaoru: Huh?

Kiryu: I don‚Äôt know much about your past. But regardless of what people say, I still think you‚Äôre a kind soul. Might not be my place to say so, but it‚Äôs just one man‚Äôs opinion.

Kaoru: Y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre a funny guy. Hard to believe ya used to be yakuza.

Kiryu: Isn‚Äôt that my point? Until they get to know the real you, people‚Äôs stereotypes don‚Äôt mean much. You said you were tipsy. You good?

Kaoru: Huh? Oh‚Ä¶ Um‚Ä¶ Sure, let‚Äôs‚Ä¶

Kiryu: I just wanna watch the stars for a bit.

Kaoru: Oh? Then I join‚Äî

Kiryu: We‚Äôre meeting up with that survivor tomorrow, right? Better get some rest‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt worry. I won‚Äôt run off anywhere.

Kaoru: N-No, I didn‚Äôt think‚Ä¶

Kiryu: You said you owed me for tonight, right? Take my advice, then.

Kaoru: Right‚Ä¶ I get it. I‚Äôll crash at Mama‚Äôs place tonight.

Kiryu: At Aoi?

Kaoru: Yep. I‚Äôll be waitin‚Äô on the bridge at 10 A.M.

Kiryu: All right.

Kaoru: Hey‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Thanks.

[Kaoru leaves. Kiryu goes back to the streets.]

Kiryu: (I‚Äôve got some time to myself. Maybe I‚Äôll check out the city.)

[As Kiryu walks through the city, he approaches the river. He notices an old man looking at a drawing of a dragon. The old man is about to throw the drawing into the water, but Kiryu stops him.]

Old Man: Wh-Who the hell‚Äôre you? What‚Äôre ya doin‚Äô?

Kiryu: You sure you won‚Äôt regret throwing that away?

Old Man: Excuse me‚Ä¶?

Kiryu: It‚Äôs a tattoo design, right? And not your average design, either.

Old Man: How did you‚Ä¶ You a family man?

Kiryu: Well‚Ä¶ Close enough.

Old Man: C‚Äômon, son. Join me for a cup of tea. Follow me.

[Kiryu follows the old man to his home.]

Girl: Welcome home, Master.

Old Man: I‚Äôve got a guest.

[He gives her the drawing.]

Girl: Oh‚Ä¶ Master, this is‚Ä¶

Old Man: Put it someplace he won‚Äôt find it.

Girl: Ah, of course.

Old Man: (to Kiryu) Hey, don‚Äôt just stand there. Come on in.

Girl: Please, sir, make yourself comfortable.

Kiryu: Yeah, sure.

Old Man: The name‚Äôs Kazahori IV, master tattooist. I‚Äôve had my practice here in Osaka ‚Äôbout as long as I can remember. I owe you one, son.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre basically the top artist in Kansai, as I‚Äôve heard it.

Kazahori IV: Oh, ya‚Äôve heard of me?

Kiryu: Yes, from the master who did the piece on my back.

Kazahori IV: Your‚Ä¶ back, huh? That certainly has some weight to it.

Kiryu: An artist named Utabori II inked it.

Kazahori IV: Utaboti? THE Utabori!?

Kiryu: You know him?

Kazahori IV: ‚ÄòCourse I know it. Tattoos may span the globe over, but it‚Äôs a small world. Get to be a master, your name‚Äôll get around.

Kiryu: So can I ask why you were about to throw that design away?

Kazahori IV: Oh, that‚Ä¶ This dragon‚Äôs practically a family heirloom. Only the acting Kazahori has the right to use it.

Kiryu: The golden dragon‚Ä¶

Kazahori IV: So ya know it? Legendary lord of the four great gods‚Ä¶ The golden dragon. The design‚Äôs actually a bit of a family heirloom. Passed down for generations.

Kiryu: Then why would you throw it away?

Kazahori IV: Well‚Ä¶

Girl: Aaah!

Kazahori IV: What was that!? What happened, Akina?

Akina: M-Master‚Ä¶ Satoshi was just here‚Ä¶ And he took the design!

Kazahori IV: What!?

Kiryu: It was stolen?

Akina: Yes, but we know who did it. It was the master‚Äôs first student.

Kiryu: Wait, what‚Äôs going on?

Kazahori IV: Him and this damn war of succession are the reason I was tryin‚Äô to be rid of that accursed piece.

Kiryu: A succession war, huh?

Kazahori IV: Lemme fill ya in‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm actually lookin‚Äô to retire soon, and I was thinkin‚Äô Akina here would take up the name.

Kiryu: Her?

Kazahori IV: That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ But the world of tattoos is a world of men. And Satoshi, my older pupil, didn‚Äôt take too kindly to the idea.

Kiryu: Satoshi is the thief?

Akina: Yes, and he‚Äôs ten years my senior.

Kazahori IV: Considerin‚Äô the world you come from, I‚Äôm sure you understand the importance of seniority, yes? Imagine someone ten years your junior passin‚Äô you up, and she‚Äôs a woman at that‚Ä¶ His pride and his ego are wounded. But you‚Äôre naming Akina as your successor because she‚Äôs better, righ?

Kazahori IV: That‚Äôs right. There‚Äôs an art to tattoos that goes beyond simple skill or techniques. You‚Äôre not a master until ya can see your clients‚Äô fates in the ink of your work. Satoshi‚Äôs just not there yet.

Akina: Master‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶

Kazahori IV: I know. Unfortunately, the other part of this little ‚Äôwar‚Äô is that Akina ain‚Äôt willing to take the name.

Kiryu: Why not?

Akina: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Kazahori IV: She won‚Äôt tell me, either. But even if she won‚Äôt take it, I‚Äôm not about to hand it to Satoshi like it‚Äôs some kinda consolation prize. He‚Äôs not ready to be Kazahori V.

Kiryu: Now I see what brought you down to the river.

Kazahori IV: Right. And that‚Äôs why Satoshi stole the dragon. If I won‚Äôt give him the name, it seems he‚Äôll take it by force.

[Kiryu stands up.]

Kazahori IV: W-Wait, what are you‚Äî

Kiryu: My tattoo has a strong resemblance to that design.

Kazahori IV: What? But‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yes. A dragon.

Kazahori IV: Really!? But I‚Äôd heard Utabori gave that to a man in Tojo Clan‚Ä¶ He considered it his magnum opus, and that was almost 20 years back. I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs done any dragons since.

Akina: Even I‚Äôve heard that story! So you‚Äôre really him‚Ä¶

Kiryu: I‚Äôm Kazuma Kiryu, and yes, I was once in the Tojo Clan.

Kazahori IV: Incredible!

Kiryu: Master Utabori taught me about both the value and the weight a tattoo carries‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Which is why I won‚Äôt stand by while Satoshi undermines all of it. I‚Äôm going to get your design back. And in return‚Ä¶ Akina, will you tell us why you refuse to take the Kazahori name?

Akina: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Kazahori IV: Akina‚Ä¶

Akina: ‚Ä¶I think that‚Äôs a fair bargain. Satoshi has set up shop in a building in Shofukucho.

Kiryu: Got it.

[Kiryu goes to Satoshi‚Äôs Shop though it looks more like a warehouse.]

Underling: Nice one, bro!

Satoshi: Yeah. This is all I need to really become Kazahori V. The guy with this dragon on his back is the talk of the whole town right now. And when the rest of Osaka wants in on the ink that made a legend, they‚Äôll come knockin‚Äô!

Kiryu: You‚Äôre Satoshi?

Satoshi: Yeah. And who the hell are you?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm here to take back the design you stole from your master. I‚Äôll be talking that dragon.

Satoshi: Oh, so Akina is sendin‚Äô heavies after us, now?

Kiryu: No, I‚Äôm here because you don‚Äôt deserve that design.

Satoshi: Who the fuck you think you are, talkin‚Äô to me like that? You know how many yakuza we‚Äôve dealt with over the years? Chumps like you always think you‚Äôre tougher than ya are!

Kiryu: Then we‚Äôre done talking. But I guess you just haven‚Äôt learned to fear yet. I‚Äôll teach you.

Satoshi: That‚Äôs our line, asshole! You‚Äôre gonna regret coming here!

[Kiryu mops the floors in the shop with Satoshi and his friends.]

Satoshi: Sh-Shit‚Ä¶ Who are ya‚Ä¶?

[Kazahori IV and Akina run in.]

Kazahori IV: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶!

Kiryu: I got your design back.

Satoshi: Y-You‚Ä¶ old bastard‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt ya see she‚Äôs got ya wrapped around her finger?

Kazahori IV: Satoshi, you‚Äôre blind. You don‚Äôt understand the true artistry of tattoos.

Satoshi: Wh-What are you babbling about?

Kazahori IV: Your fingers know their way around the ink, but your soul can‚Äôt see the colors. That‚Äôs the difference between you and Akina.

Satoshi: More of this pretentious bullshit‚Ä¶

Kazahori IV: Tattoos are a permanent part of a person‚Äôs life, Satoshi. It changes them. Someone like you who‚Äôs just puttin‚Äô ink on two-bit street punks for money‚Ä¶ Just goes to prove what little ya contribute to the art. A tattoo nurtures the man who bears it, and in turn, the design finds its home on their skin.

Satoshi: Oh yeah? Then tell me, ‚Äúmaster‚Äù‚Ä¶ Who‚Äôs got that golden dragon on his back now? He some great hero!? Say his name!

Kazahori IV: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Who does have that dragon?

Kazahori IV: His name is‚Ä¶ Ryuji Goda.

Kiryu: What?

Satoshi: Hahaha! Yeah, that Ryuji Goda! Ya gave your ultimate tattoo to some crazy fuck, and now ya wanna lecture me about art!?

Akina: It‚Äôs not true! The master didn‚Äôt give him that tattoo!

Kazahori IV: Akina‚Ä¶!

Satoshi: Wh-What?

Akina: I was the one who inked the golden dragon.

Kazahori IV: Ten years ago, when I first laid eyes on Ryuji Goda, I was dumbstruck. I knew then that man would be my finest canvas. I decided to inscribe the family dragon. But after I‚Äôd started the outlines‚Ä¶ My hands froze up. Couldn‚Äôt move a muscle.

Akina: It‚Äôs true. So I took over. I finished the Master‚Äôs tattoo.

Satoshi: Th-That tattoo was‚Ä¶ yours?

Akina: That‚Äôs how I learned the true weight of being a tattoo artist‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôve never been more scared. Ryuji Goda climbed the ranks of the Omi Alliance‚Ä¶ And now he‚Äôs clawing his way toward the throne itself. I never dreamed a man bearing my ink could become what he has‚Ä¶

Kazahori IV: Akina. That‚Äôs why you deserve the name. A master tattooist‚Äôs calling is to make bigger men of their clients. So that‚Äôs why you rejected the Kazahori name?

Akina: ‚Ä¶Yes. I‚Äôm afraid of giving men like him more power‚Ä¶

Kazahori IV: Akina‚Ä¶

[They go back to Kazahori‚Äôs Shop. Kiryu takes off his jacket revealing his dragon.]

Satoshi: Th-That‚Äôs..

Kazahori IV: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Utabori-san‚Äôs‚Ä¶ dragon.

Kiryu: Ever since I took this dragon, I‚Äôve gained a lot and lost as much. But this dragon and the way my life has turned out are connected‚Ä¶ I believe it‚Äôs all fate. You weren‚Äôt wrong to have given Ryuji Goda that dragon.

Kazahori IV: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶

Kiryu: It‚Äôs easy for men with power to stray. They‚Äôre only human. But‚Ä¶ setting them straight isn‚Äôt your job. The artist can lay the paths, but the man chooses which one to walk. Akina-san‚Ä¶ If the art weighs that heavily on you‚Ä¶ How can you turn away from the Kazahori name that stands on Ryuji‚Äôs path?

Akina: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Best of luck to you. (walks away)

Akina: Kiryu-san! I won‚Äôt run anymore! I‚Äôll become Kazahori V. Thank you for showing me that!

[Akina and Kazahori IV bow to Kiryu. He leaves the building.]

Chapter 11: THE IRON CREED
Kiryu: (It‚Äôs almost 10:00. Sayama‚Äôs waiting for me at Iwao Bridge.)

Kiryu: So? You ready? What‚Äôs up?

Kaoru: I was thinking about everything last night, and I got this bad feeling.

Kiryu: A bad feeling?

Kaoru: Yeah‚Ä¶ What if I‚Äôm one of the Jingweon survivors?

Kiryu: How do you figure?

Kaoru: If what Mama said is true‚Ä¶ And my parents were killed 20-some years ago by the Tojo Clan‚Ä¶ Wouldn‚Äôt it make sense if the Tojo Clan killed them in the Jingweon raid? It would line up, wouldn‚Äôt it?

Kiryu: You? Another Jingweon survivor?

Kaoru: You can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs possible.

Kiryu: Want to call off the meeting with Murai?

Kaoru: I won‚Äôt run away from my past.

[Kiryu lights a cigarette but Kaoru quickly takes it away.]

Kaoru: Let‚Äôs get moving.

[They walk a bit.]

Kaoru: The chief said we‚Äôll find Murai somewhere called ‚ÄúKeima.‚Äù I need to hear what he has to say.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre sure about this, though?

Kaoru: Don‚Äôt worry about me. Whatever he can say, I can handle it. But first we‚Äôll need to hit the streets to see if we can even find the place.

Find Keima
[Kiryu approaches some guys sitting in an aopen cafe.]

Kiryu: Excuse me, do you know of a place called ‚ÄúKeima‚Äù?

Shogi Lover: Keima‚Ä¶? I‚Äôve heard the rumors, but I couldn‚Äôt give ya any facts. Oh, so you‚Äôve got some confidence in your shogi skills?

Kiryu: Not really.

Shogi Lover: That so? Maybe ya oughta take a glance at the rulebook. The world of shogi‚Äôs like the universe, an infinite expanse of possibility. May your moves bring ya closer to victory than ruin.

[Kiryu and Kaoru approach some old man.]

Kaoru: Hey, excuse me. Ever heard of a place called "Keima"?

Old Shogi Player: ‚Ä¶‚ÄùKeima‚Äù? I‚Äôve heard the name, but I couldn‚Äôt tell ya where it is.

Kaoru: I see‚Ä¶

Old Shogi Player: Reason I know it though is ‚Äôcause I knew a guy who was in and outta there back in the day.

Kiryu: Then you do know it?

Old Shogi Player: How about‚Ä¶ three big bills for the tip?

Kiryu: I don‚Äôt have enough on me for that. I‚Äôll be back, though.

Old Shogi Player: If ya say so‚Ä¶

Kaoru: ‚ÄúKeima‚Äù is what the knights are called in shogi, so it‚Äôs probably a shogi parlor. I can‚Äôt play shogi to save my life, though, so I leave that part to you.

[Kiryu finds the money to pay for the information.]

Old Shogi Player: What‚Äôs up, buddy? Feel like coughin‚Äô up the dough?

Kiryu: Fine‚Ä¶

[Kiryu pays 30,000 yen.]

Old Shogi Player: Oho! I do enjoy a smooth negotiation! Well, a deal‚Äôs a deal. The guy who can get ya in is a gamblin‚Äô man who goes by Ginkaku. There‚Äôs a rundown bar west of Shofukucho called ‚ÄùMino.‚Äù He used to hang out there. And that‚Äôs all I know. Pleasure doin‚Äô business with ya.

[Kiryu runs to Mino.]

Kiryu: No good. It‚Äôs locked‚Ä¶

[He notices a poster near the door.]

Kiryu: This poster looks pretty old‚Ä¶

Kaoru: But look. There‚Äôs a phone number on it. I‚ÄôlI just jot this down. It‚Äôs probably a cellphone. Give it a call, maybe?

[Kiryu calls the number.]

Kiryu: (‚Ä¶They actually picked up.) Hello? I have reason to believe you can tell me about a place called "Keima."

Unknown Voice: There‚Äôs this popular hostess down at the Red Sirloin. Goes by Yukina-chan, and she‚Äôs known for bein‚Äô pleasantly plump. Her sizes, please?

Kiryu: What the hell? What‚Äôs that have to do with anything?

Unknown Voice: There‚Äôs this popular hostess down at the Red Sirloin. Goes by Yukina-chan, and she‚Äôs known for bein‚Äô pleasantly plump. Her sizes, please?

[Kiryu trying to guess but fails.]

Kiryu: What the‚Ä¶ He hung up.

[He runs in an adult movies shop.]

Cabaret Fiend: I‚Äôm already missin‚Äô Yukina-chan! Once you lay eyes on that buxom body, all other hostess cease to exist! I got her sizes, y‚Äôknow. She‚Äôs 110, 100, 109, top to bottom! Heh heh heh‚Ä¶ Why don‚Äôt ya head down there and request her yourself, bud? You‚Äôll never see women the same way!

[Kiryu calls the number again.]

Unknown voice: There‚Äôs this popular hostess down at the Red Sirloin, Goes by Yukina-chan, and she‚Äôs known for bein‚Äô pleasantly plump. Her sizes, please?

[Kiryu tells Yukina-chan‚Äôs sizes.]

Unknown voice: That‚Äôs right. Make yourselves comfortable down at Mino for a spell.

Kiryu: Wait, what? Damn‚Ä¶ He hung up.

[Kiryu returns to Mino to find some more clues.]

Kiryu: (The door‚Äôs unlocked‚Ä¶)

Kaoru: How strange‚Ä¶ Ugh, what smells so damn foul?

Kiryu: Doesn‚Äôt seem like the place has gotten much use lately.

[He examines the room.]

Kiryu: (This shogi board has some pieces on it. From left to right, its the gold general, rook, king, pawn, bishop, and silver general.)

Kiryu: (This note refers to shogi pieces. From left to right, it says "king," "gold general," ‚Äúsilver general,‚Äù and ‚Äúpawn.‚Äù What‚Äôs the significance, though?)

Kiryu: (That safe looks pretty suspect‚Ä¶)

[He tries to open it.]

Kiryu: (No luck. Must be the wrong combination.)

[He solves the puzzle and opens the safe.]

Kiryu: I was right.

Kaoru: What?

[Kiryu‚Äôs phone is ringing.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Unknown Voice: Well done. Wasn‚Äôt that simple? Now. Go order a Christmas present at Komian.

Kiryu: What the‚Ä¶ He hung up.

[Kiryu walks into a nearby Komian store.]

Komian Employee: Hi there.

Kiryu: I was told to order a Christmas present‚Ä¶

Komian Employee: ‚Ä¶Ah, that. Just take a seat, sir.

[The employee brings the present.]

Kiryu: (There‚Äôs something hard in this! W-What the hell‚Ä¶?)

Komian Employee: Come see us again!

Kaoru: Well?

Kiryu: I found this in the food‚Ä¶

Kaoru: A shogi piece? What do you think it means, though?

Old Shogi Player: Ooh! Hey buddy, what a coincidence. Did you get to meet Ginkaku?

Kiryu: No, but the latest hoop I jumped through ended up giving me this shogi piece.

Old Shogi Player: That so? Oh, hey‚Ä¶ That piece‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs not a ryuma piece, is it?

Kiryu: Excuse me?

Old Shogi Player: Look, why don‚Äôt ya just give me that piece, bud. Not like it means anything to you, am I right?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm still not sure what all this is supposed to mean, quite frankly.

Old Shogi Player: Then c‚Äômon, hand over that piece!

Kaoru: We‚Äôre not going to just hand it over while we‚Äôre in the middle of this wild goose chase. Wanna explain why it‚Äôs so important?

Old Shogi Player: What a yappy bitch‚Ä¶ If ya won‚Äôt hand it over‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs only gonna bring ya pain.

[Kiryu and Kaoru kicks his ass.]

Old Shogi Player: Huff‚Ä¶ Huff‚Ä¶ Damn you!

Kaoru: So, care to tell us what‚Äôs so important about this piece? It‚Äôs your turn to be the yappy bitch.

Old Shogi Player: That piece‚Ä¶ It was crafted by a master, considered a treasure among us shogi players‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs basically a golden ticket into even the most underground shogi parlors‚Ä¶ Any shogi player worth his salt would kill to have one. So I guess I‚Äôm lettin‚Äô ya off the hook today‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt show no mercy next time‚Ä¶

[He runs away. Kiryu phone‚Äôs ringing.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Unknown Voice: Impressive work. That piece is quite coveted, so I‚Äôd be careful if I were you.

Kiryu: Come on‚Ä¶ How long do we have to play this stupid game?

Unknown Voice: Oh, don‚Äôt be that way. This is fun. For me, anyway. No hard feelings, I hope.

Kiryu: I just want to know where Keima is.

Unknown Voice: Show that piece to Santa Claus, and his red-nosed reindeer will guide the way.

Kiryu: What? Santa Claus? This is getting even more ridiculous.

Unknown Voice: That‚Äôs all the help I‚Äôll give ya. May your moves bring ya closer to victory than ruin.

[Kiryu approaches some yakuza guarding Sun shine Club.]

Kiryu: Excuse me‚Ä¶ Are you Santa Claus by any chance?

Yakuza: Huh? You think it‚Äôs wise to spout that kinda nonsense at strangers?

Kiryu: I take it you‚Äôre not. Sorry to bother you.

Yakuza: You fuckin‚Äô with me!? If you want Santa so bad, here‚Äôs a goddamn present!

[Kiryu pounds his ugly mug.]

Kiryu: Not him‚Ä¶ No choice but to keep trying.

[He finds a guy in a red suit.]

Man in Red Suit: ‚Ä¶Somethin‚Äô ya need?

Kiryu: (I should show him that piece‚Ä¶)

Man in Red Suit: That piece‚Ä¶ Who referred ya?

Kiryu: Ginkaku‚Ä¶

Man in Red Suit: Don‚Äôt know how ya got it, but‚Ä¶ Ain‚Äôt my circus, ain‚Äôt my monkey. Follow me.

[They walk to some abandoned building.]

Man in Red Suit: We‚Äôre runnin things from here today.

[Kiryu and Kaoru enter the parlor. Some man tending a bonfire with kettle on it greets them.]

Man: This ain‚Äôt a date spot, kids.

[Kiryu shows him the piece.]

Man: This is Heinosuke Sugiura‚Äôs work. Surprised ya got yer hands on one. So? Who ya playin‚Äô?

Kiryu: Murai.

Man: Murai‚Ä¶?

Kaoru: Yeah, Murai‚Äôs our man.

[The old man in the corner with the round glasses gets all excited when he hears the name. Kaoru walks to him.]

Kaoru: Are you Murai-san?

Old Man: This is what the board looked like after the 142nd move of the 1984 Meijin Match. Yabuta, the challenger, promoted his bishop to 5-8. That‚Äôs what sealed his defeat. Any pro would know the right move would be silver general to 4-3 to defend the king. For some reason Yabuta went on the offensive‚Ä¶ People called it a rookie mistake, but I don‚Äôt buy it.

Kaoru: I‚Äôve got a question for you.

Old Man: Nothin‚Äô I know would be of interest to a young lady like you.

Kaoru: We got your name from Bessho from Osaka PD. Don‚Äôt worry, I work under Chief Bessho. I need to know about the Jingweon Mafia. You remember that night in Kamurocho‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt you?

[The Old Man wants to leave but Kaoru stops him.]

Kaoru: I think I may be one of the survivors. Were there any children there too young to remember it?

Old Man: ‚Ä¶There was one.

Kaoru: Please, I need details!

Old Man: If you can live without knowing, you‚Äôll be a lot better off.

Kaoru: Please, tell me!

Old Man: After losing the Meijin Match, Yabuta quit shogi, fell to booze and eventually died. He was bent on reaching the top, but my guess is he realized he couldn‚Äôt cut it. He saw his fate in the tiles. He chose a move that defied fate, chose to die on his own terms. Life can be cruel. You‚Äôve made it this far without knowing, miss. No reason to take on that burden now.

Kaoru: There‚Äôs nothing you can say that I can‚Äôt handle. That‚Äôs why I came here today. Please. Tell me what you know! I‚Äôm not moving until you do. I‚Äôm begging you!

Old Man: It was Christmas night.

Kiryu: On Christmas?

Old Man: We were all busy celebrating when the Dojima Family burst in. They killed with precision, one man after another‚Ä¶

Kaoru: But you three managed to survive‚Ä¶

Old Man: Right‚Ä¶

Kaoru: You managed to flee to Kansai with help from Kawara-san and Bessho-san, right?

Old Man: Yeah, but men sent in from the mainland found me down here. And yet, here I am today.

Kaoru: How?

Old Man: I sold out my own.

Kaoru: The other two survivors?

Old Man: No, not Daejin Kim and Yeongmin Ji.

Kaoru: Daejin Kim and Yeongmin Ji‚Ä¶?

Old Man: They were only 16 at the time, but somehow they made it out alive. Who knows where they are now.

Kaoru: In that case, who‚Äôd you sell out?

Old Man: Truth is‚Ä¶ There were two more. Two other survivors‚Ä¶ They were‚Ä¶ The boss‚Äôs wife‚Ä¶ And her child.

Kaoru: Her child?

[We‚Äôre going back to the 80‚Äôs, in the same building from the beginning of the game. Kazama aims at wounded Korean guy. Kawara hides behind the corner. Kazama shot the Korean guy.]

Korean Guy: [‚Ä¶ You lying dog! Though I die, we‚Äôll live on‚Ä¶ See you in hell!]

[The guy falls on the floor. Kazama aims at young Murai, but he changes his mind and walks away. Kawara runs out to the killed guy.]

Kawara: Hey, stay with me‚Ä¶

Korean Guy: My child‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ beg‚Ä¶

[Kawara hears baby cries and runs towards it.]

Murai: [Boss!]

[Suddenly Shimano comes out and shoots Murai. We‚Äôre back to the present.]

Murai: He missed my heart, and I survived‚Ä¶ After that night, I was given the name Murai, and here I am today.

Kiryu: So Sayama‚Äôs father‚Ä¶ was the Jingweon boss?

Kaoru: Where did his wife and her child go then?

Murai: They both escaped with Kawara-san..

Kaoru: So you sold a woman and her infant to the syndicate to save your own skin!?

Murai: I‚Äôm not sure what happened to them after that.

Kaoru: The mother died. Only the child survived!

Murai: Are you‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre really that poor kid?

Kaoru: (hits the shogi table) Who killed the father?

Murai: I don‚Äôt remember his name, just his face. I remember his moustache‚Ä¶

Kiryu: That‚Äôd be‚Ä¶ It has to be Kazama-san.

Kaoru: Hm?

Kiryu: The man who raised me. Shintaro Kazama.

Kaoru: You‚Äôre sure?

Kiryu: Yeah. I was there too.

[Kaoru‚Äôs eyes widen with shock. At that moment, several men with knifes burst into the room.]

Man: Who the hell are‚Äî

[One of the attackers kills him sticking his knife in the man‚Äôs stomach.]

Kiryu: Jingweon Mafia, I presume?

Leader: That‚Äôs right.

Kiryu: The bombing and the kidnappings‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre the ones?

Leader: Absolutely. And we owe you our thanks. You tracked down the deserter for us.

Kiryu: Before you get to him‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre going to tell me where Chairman Goda is being held.

Murai: It‚Äôs no use. They‚Äôre elites, straight from the mainland. No way in hell they‚Äôll talk.

Kiryu: Well‚Ä¶ You gonna tell me where Chairman Goda is or not?

Leader: Hardly matters. You‚Äôll be in hell soon!

[Kiryu and Kaoru are forced to fight the Jingweon thugs.]

Kiryu: Now tell me where Chairman Goda is!

[One of the thugs throws his knife into Murai‚Ä¶ and hits his stomach.]

Kaoru: Stay with me‚Ä¶!

[Leader takes advantage of the moment and pours poison down his throat from the ring. The other thugs do the same.]

Murai: That‚Äôs the Jingweon creed‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ should‚Äôve followed it, too. Thinking a man like me‚Ä¶ Who ruined so many lives‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Had any right to lead a happy, normal life‚Ä¶ I was a fool‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt beat fate‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve died that night. I‚Äôll be sure to‚Ä¶ tell your mother‚Ä¶ Her little girl‚Äôs grown up right. Live to your fullest‚Ä¶

[He puts the piece on the shogi board, creating perhaps some combination. Then he takes the handle of the knife and sticks it deep into his belly and dies. Shocked Kaoru runs out of the parlor.]

Majima Saga - Chapter 3: MAD DOG OF SHIMANO
[We return to Majima, who was massaged by an unsuspecting Makoto, the blind girl he saved years ago.]

Makoto: Is this pressure okay, sir? I‚Äôll move on to your feet next, okay? There may be some discomfort, but just shout if it gets to be too much.

[Majima wants to scream in pain, but restrains herself so Makoto won‚Äôt recognize his voice.]

Makoto: Hm? Is there any pain, sir? No, then? If you say so, sir.

[Majima endures some more pain.]

Makoto: I‚Äôll do your arms next, okay?

[Majima notices the watch on Makoto‚Äôs hand and gasps in shock. She still wears them. So it‚Äôs definitely her.]

Makoto: Oh, sorry! Is my watch bothering you? It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a treasure of mine. I‚Äôve had it almost 20 years‚Ä¶ I take good care of it. When the strap wore out, I even got a new one for it. It‚Äôs an old piece though, so new colors don‚Äôt really match it‚Ä¶ I really liked the original design, it felt more sophisticated‚Ä¶ To tell you the truth I got it from someone who saved my life. I‚Ä¶ Actually, there was a time when I was blind due to psychological reasons‚Ä¶ That was when I met him. I was just a stranger caught in a big mess‚Ä¶ But he protected me with his life, never even telling me his name. At the lowest point in my life‚Ä¶ He pulled me back from the darkness. Thanks to him, I even regained my vision. I got married, had a child‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm always swamped, but life is great. Back then, I never would‚Äôve imagined a future like this was possible for me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ really happy now. I‚Äôm just so glad I didn‚Äôt lose hope, that I found the will to keep going‚Ä¶ But when we parted ways, I never even got a chance to thank him for that. I‚Äôve regretted it ever since‚Ä¶ In fact, that‚Äôs what led me back to working at this massage parlor. This is actually where I first met him. And Sotenbori is a special town to me, full of memories of what time we had‚Ä¶ So I thought if I stuck around and just led my life in these old haunts‚Ä¶ Maybe I‚Äôd meet him again one more time. Meet him, and finally get a chance to say "thank you." Oh dear, I‚Äôm so sorry I put you through such a depressing story! Sorry, I‚Äôm extra chatty today for some reason. Y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶ Not even my husband knows that story, so it‚Äôs our little secret, okay?

Majima: (quietly) Heh.

[After the massage Makoto walks to leaving Majima.]

Makoto: Oh, sir! Have one of our membership cards‚Ä¶ Please.

[Majima silently takes the card.]

Makoto: Um‚Ä¶ We haven‚Äôt met before, have we?

[Majima is shocked but shakes his head.]

Makoto: U-Um! Are you feeling better at least, sir?

Majima: Ya worked out some knots I‚Äôve had for 18 years.

Makoto: (clueless) Thank you so much!

[Majima walks out of the Relaxation Center and sees the receptionist.]

Receptionist: You got lucky, you know. This is actually Tateyama-san is really good, isn‚Äôt she?

Majima: Yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad I came.

Receptionist: You got lucky, you know. This is actually Tateyama-san‚Äôs last week.

Majima: Wait, she‚Äôs quitting?

Receptionist: Yes, apparently her husband‚Äôs job is taking them overseas. Losing our number one masseuse is really going to hit our shop hard.

Majima: How many more days does she have in the country?

Receptionist: Huh? Uh, I think she said something about getting on a plane early next week.

Majima: ‚Ä¶Hm.

Receptionist: (bows) Well, thanks for coming in, sir!

[Majima phone‚Äôs ringing.]

Ayumi: Um, sir? This is Ayumi, over at the Grand!

Majima: Ya sound kinda worked up. What‚Äôs goin‚Äô on?

Ayumi: It‚Äôs Kawamura! He‚Äôs here!

Majima: Say what?

Ayumi: I was at a VIP table with an exec from‚Ä¶ Well, he was from the Omi Alliance‚Ä¶ But then Kawamura charged in and shot the guy! We‚Äôre in a lockdown situation right now, so get here quick!

Majima: Yeah, I‚Äôm headin‚Äô there now. Just hang tight! (Kawamura just shot an Omi exec? What‚Äôs that damn kid thinkin‚Äô!? I better haul it to the Grand!)

=Go to the Cabaret Grand=
Majima: (This is the end of the road, I‚Äôd say. Should I handle business, or am I bein‚Äô hasty? Alright, it‚Äôs on!)

[Majima enters his old cabaret, which he created with his own hands.]

Majima: Kawamura!

Kawamura: Boss‚Ä¶?

Majima: The hell are ya doin!?

Kawamura: I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ But I didn‚Äôt have a choice‚Ä¶ If I didn‚Äôt kill him, it woulda been me‚Ä¶

Majima: What do ya mean!? You the one who shot Uematsu!?

Kawamura: ‚Ä¶Yes. But there‚Äôs only one left‚Ä¶ Just one more. And when it‚Äôs done‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be free.

[He points his gun at Majima.]

Majima: Kawamura‚Ä¶ Son of a‚Ä¶

Kawamura: If I kill you, boss‚Ä¶ I get out alive. I‚Äôm really sorry, boss‚Ä¶ But die, please!

[Majima pulls out his tanto and shreds this sorry shit in seconds.]

Kawamura: You‚Äôre really something‚Ä¶ Boss. If only I‚Äôd met you earlier‚Ä¶ My life might‚Äôve been different.

Majima: Kawamura‚Ä¶ Why‚Äôd ya pull a stunt like this?

Kawamura: Boss‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorr‚Äî

[Someone shot him in the head. It‚Äôs Ibuchi!]

Ibuchi: You did well, Kawamura. We‚Äôll consider your debt‚Ä¶ paid in full.

Majima: Ibuchi‚Ä¶!

Ibuchi: Wield both scissors and fools with caution‚Ä¶ An old one, but still true. Shoulder their debts, and they‚Äôre clay in your hands. A little money, a little violence‚Ä¶ Yakuza are truly silly and oh so simple.

Majima: So you‚Äôre the guy pullin‚Äô all the strings, Ibuchi?

Ibuchi: (points his gun at Majima) Heh‚Ä¶ Yes. Exactly.

Majima: So‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs your motive?

Ibuchi: You know what‚Äôs one of the most illogical and old-fashioned industries in the world? It‚Äôs the yakuza. A bunch of brainless cretins professing duty and ideals as they rule in whatever haphazard way they see fit‚Ä¶ Really, their methods render the industry all-too inefficient‚Ä¶ Coming from a consulting background myself, I decided to do some proper management.

Majima: What the hell?

Ibuchi: I‚Äôll plan to consolidate the yakuza clans scattered across the country and provide some semblance of logic to our underground world‚Ä¶ In other words, I‚Äôm going to update the yakuza. I‚ÄôIl take this musty relic and completely redraw it.

Majima: And you killed Uematsu as part of this dream of yours?

Ibuchi: Yes, the consolidation of the yakuza.

Ibuchi: As my foothold, I decided the Tojo Clan would be simple enough to overthrow. I tricked Terada into pushing me through the ranks and got rid of those in my way‚Ä¶ Including Uematsu‚Ä¶ and you. Naturally, I‚Äôll have to take care of Terada when the time comes. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôll seize the Tojo Clan‚Ä¶ And then hand it to the Omi Alliance.

Majima: The Omi!?

Ibuchi: Yes, if the Omi acquires the Tojo Clan, it would be the largest yakuza organization in Japan. From there, national consolidation is elementary‚Ä¶. And I would take on the esteemed post of reorganizing the underworld into its ideal structure, I will create a logical, more modern yakuza world. One that isn‚Äôt swayed by duty or ideals.

Majima: Heh‚Ä¶ What a crock.

Ibuchi: I don‚Äôt expect a man like you to understand the true value. But I‚Äôm already in talks with an executive at the Omi Alliance. All that‚Äôs left is to execute it. However, to ensure a smooth merger of the Omi and Tojo‚Ä¶ I need an explosive catalyst‚Ä¶ And by that‚Ä¶ I mean war. There‚Äôs no firmer trigger than the death of an Omi executive at Tojo Clan hands‚Ä¶ Kawamura had very nearly seen that through‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs a shame that a punk like Kawamura would kill you‚Ä¶ When I can do it myself. Sorry, but your death is my kindling for the coming blaze. You‚Äôll be the foundation that rights this rotting underworld. That‚Äôs not so bad, is it? You‚Äôd probably end up dead in some ditch anyway. At least dying here‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Gives it meaning.

Majima: Mine ain‚Äôt the kinda life that guys like you attach prices to. I don‚Äôt give a shit about your little vision. I‚Äôm only here‚Ä¶ to knock that smug-ass grin off your smug-ass face!

Ibuchi: (laughs) Typical, that you would try to change fate by force alone‚Ä¶ An idiotic dinosaur of a yakuza like you‚Ä¶ Needs to be extinct, Majima!

[Majima quietly pulls out his tanto and, dodging a shot, wants to stab Ibuchi in the stomach. Ibuchi evades and tries to shoot Majima in the face. Majima steps aside and attacks, but Ibuchi manages to dodge out of the way. After a brief exchange of strikes, Majima knocks the gun out of Ibuchi‚Äôs hands and attacks, but Ibuchi grabs the pistol in mid-air and shoots straight into Majima‚Äôs tanto. An epic battle between the two patriarchs ensues! Majima wins of course. Ibuchi lies on the floor, panting.]

Majima: (grabs Ibuchi by the face) If ya thought I‚Äôd let ya get away with takin‚Äô out one of mine‚Ä¶ (puts his tanto to Ibuchi‚Äôs neck) Who‚Äôs the real idiot here? Go eat your slop in the can. And learn to see things my way. (throws Ibuchi on the floor)

Ibuchi: (grabs his gun) It‚Äôs too late, Majima‚Ä¶! The wheels are already spinning. War will consume the east and the west. And the Tojo Clan will fade. (laughs) Things are just about to get interesting! It‚Äôll be prime entertainment! So I‚Äôll go on ahead‚Ä¶ And get the best seat in the house.

[And he shot himself. Majima walks away and returns to the Tojo Clan building.]

Terada: Majina-san‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm truly sorry about how things unfolded. It falls on me for failing to see Ibuchi‚Äôs true intentions. I‚Äôd always known he had something of a devious side, but‚Ä¶ I focused so intently on the numbers, I lost sight of what cannot be quantified‚Ä¶ Perhaps I‚Äôve been going about it the wrong way‚Ä¶

Majima: The chairman shouldn‚Äôt admit he‚Äôs wrong, even if it‚Äôs true.

Terada: Hm?

Majima: You‚Äôre the fifth chairman of the Tojo Clan. If you say it‚Äôs white, it‚Äôs white. If you say it‚Äôs black, it‚Äôs black. That‚Äôs the yakuza world we live in. No matter your methods, if you think you‚Äôre right, you are. But, right or wrong‚Ä¶ I think your methods suck

Terada: Heh.

Majima: Enough on that, though. It‚Äôs the Omi we gotta worry about.

Terada: The Omi?

Majima: I was throwin‚Äô down right in the Omi‚Äôs backyard on this little escapade. Even if it was Ibuchi‚Äôs plot, it don‚Äôt change the fact that one of my boys killed an Omi exec. They gonna take that sittin‚Äô down?

Terada: Right‚Ä¶ I admit, the Omi is already demanding an explanation.

Majima: If we get into a war with the Omi now‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre cooked. So I‚Äôve got an idea I wanna propose.

Terada: An idea?

[Majima pulls out his tanto in its shielth.]

Terada: Majima-san‚Ä¶

[They go to sit down with the Omi Alliance.]

Terada: Regarding the incident‚Ä¶ We apologize profusely for the disruptions to the Omi Alliance.

Ryuji: "Profuse" apologies? More like spit in the wind. You‚Äôre as lenient as ya‚Äôve always been‚Ä¶ Terada-han.

Toranosuke: He may have been third rung, but one of our officers is dead thanks to your clan‚Äôs little tiff. How ya gonna make this right? Answer wise now‚Ä¶ Or Kansai and Kanto may be goin‚Äô to war on the grand scale.

Jin Goda: Let‚Äôs relax‚Ä¶ We didn‚Äôt set up this meeting to start a fight. I apologize for my officers‚Äô lack of grace.

Terada: Not at all.

Jin Goda: However, Sengoku and the others have a point. If we let this slide without reparation‚Ä¶ It‚Äôll set a bad precedent down through the ranks. War is the last thing I want. But how do you plan to take responsibility?

Majima: Yeah, about that. Ibuchi may have set the whole thing up, but in the end, it was one of my crew who did the deed. So the fault lies with me, his patriarch.

Takashima: Oh? And how do you plan to take responsibility?

Majima: The Majima Family‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll disband it.

Toranosuke: ‚ÄôScuse me!? The Majima Family is practically the reignin‚Äô authority in the Tojo Clan these days. Ya think you can disband a family like that just ‚Äôcause ya feel like it!?

Majima: (angerly) If lsay we‚Äôre done, then we‚Äôre fuckin‚Äô done! (calmly) The Majima Family is gone of us are leavin‚Äô the Tojo Clan includin‚Äô me. We apologize profusely for what happened. With that‚Ä¶ Are ya willing to settle accounts? (bows)

[Jin Goda stay silent. Everyone leaves the room except Toranosuke, Takashima and Ryuji.]

Toranosuke: Just when the sparks of war were ‚Äôbout to ignite‚Ä¶ That Majima guy goes n‚Äô pulls the rug out.

Takashima: If you want a war so badly, why didn‚Äôt you pick a fight then and there?

Ryuji: Pickin‚Äô a fight with a no-bullshit guy like that? Outta the question.

Toranosuke: ‚ÄòSides‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get our chance to take on the Tojo Clan sooner or later, eh? I‚Äôll save the fun and games for when that day comes.

Takashima: War, huh? Would it be fair to ask if one of you was behind Ibuchi in the first place?

Ryuji: Those‚Äôre fightin‚Äô words‚Ä¶ So right back at ya. Goro Majima‚Ä¶ Hell of a guy.

[Meanwhile Majima opens a construction business.]

Majima: Gentlemen! Mornin‚Äô!

Workers: Good morning‚Ä¶

Majima: That was weak shit! People who can‚Äôt give a proper greetin‚Äô can‚Äôt build a proper building! Now! Once more! Ready‚Ä¶ All together now‚Ä¶

Workers: Good morning!

Majima: See. I knew ya had it in ya! So why didn‚Äôt ya do it right the first time!?

Worker: U-Um, Boss?

Majima: Eh? What? Are we really going to be running a business called Majima Construction? Building a huge complex like Kamurocho Hills‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs impossible for amateurs like us!

Majima: Ya jackass! (slaps the worker)

Majima: Amateurs, huh? Stop cryin‚Äô like a buncha babies! Are we gonna get any hills built with an attitude like that!?

Worker: No, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm trying to say, actually‚Ä¶

Majima: For a job like this‚Ä¶ Ya look it up on the internet and start buildin‚Äô!

Worker: S-Seriously!?

Majima: Ready boys? Today is the first day of our new lives! Not as a yakuza, but as a blue-collar civilians! ‚Ä¶Who work day in and day out! Any complainers‚Ä¶ get no paycheck! Actually‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll kill ya first!

Worker: We‚Äôre‚Ä¶ a sweatshop, aren‚Äôt we.

[Meanwhile Makoto already board her plane with her husband and son.]

Makoto: Right, passport, passport‚Ä¶ Ah‚Ä¶

[She finds a giftbox in her purse. She recalls that this giftbox was handed to her by the receptionist in the Relaxation Center.]

Receptionist: This came addressed to you, Makoto-san. There‚Äôs no sender though‚Ä¶ Think it‚Äôs one of your regulars?

Makoto: Hm!?

[Inside the giftbox there‚Äôs a pair of watch straps.]

Makoto: This‚Ä¶ I used to wear this‚Ä¶ How, though?

[She recalls her talk with one of the clients that was Majima.]

Makoto: (offscreen) It‚Äôs an old piece though, so new colors don‚Äôt really match it‚Ä¶ I really liked the original design, it felt more sophisticated‚Ä¶ When the strap wore out, I even got a new one for it. I‚Äôve had it almost 20 years‚Ä¶ I take good care of it.

[After a while, the plane lands.]

Makoto‚Äôs Husband: What‚Äôs wrong, Makoto? Couldn‚Äôt sleep?

Makoto: No, no, I‚Äôm fine. This‚Äôll be a fresh start for us.

Makoto‚Äôs Husband: Do you have any regrets?

Makoto: Nope. Not anymore.

THE END

Chapter 12: OSAKA CASTLE
[Kiryu and Kaoru take some fresh air after that happened in the shogi parlor.]

Kiryu: Will you hear me out? That Christmas, I headed to the Dojima Family office‚Ä¶ Every Christmas, Kazama-san used to come to Sunflower, the orphanage I grew up in. But we hadn‚Äôt seen him at all that day. I was getting worried about him, so I snuck out to Kamurocho on my own.

[Shimano and Kazama get in the car. At that time, a young Kiryu, who looks about 12-15 years old, runs up to them.]

Young Kiryu: (bows) It‚Äôs been a while, sir.

Kazama: Why are you here?

Young Kiryu: I wanted to talk to you.

Kazama: Not today, kid. Go home.

Kiryu: (offscreen) I knew him to be a kind man‚Ä¶ But that night was different. I was worried, so I followed him. He was going to defy his boss and let the Jingweon live‚Ä¶ Of course, I didn‚Äôt know that‚Ä¶

[He follows Kazama and overhears him talking to a Korean Mafia boss, who points his gun at Kazama.]

Mafia Boss: You‚Äôd just‚Ä¶ let us walk away?

Kazama: On one condition. That you leave this town for good.

Mafia Boss: Sounds like a trap to me.

Kiryu: (offscreen) I couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying. I thought‚Ä¶ the old man was in danger. I just wanted to protect him.

Kazama: Call your men and head out the back.

[The sound of a gunshot comes from somewhere. Apparently Shimano has already started to kill.]

Kazama: It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they‚Äôre all dead. You have to trust me!

[At that moment, young Kiryu bursts into the room with a piece of pipe in his hands.]

Kazama: Kazuma!?

Mafia Boss: I knew this was a trap!

Kazama: Wait! The boy‚Äôs not Tojo Clan!

[Young Kiryu Attacks Mafia Boss‚Ä¶. A shot is fired‚Ä¶ Kazama shot Mafia Boss to protect Kiryu‚Ä¶]

Young Kiryu: I‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Thought you were‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶In danger‚Ä¶

[The Mafia boss crawls out of the room. Kazama, stone-faced, slowly follows him. The scene from the beginning of the game repeats, only now we see events from the young Kiryu‚Äôs perspective.]

Mafia Boss: [‚Ä¶You lying dog! Though I die, we‚Äôll live on‚Ä¶ See you in hell!]

Kiryu: (offscreen) Kazama-san was protecting me.

[We return to the present.]

Kiryu: That‚Äôs why he shot him‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt pull the trigger‚Ä¶ But it may as well have been me who killed your father.

[Kaoru stands up and walks away.]

Kiryu: Weren‚Äôt you going to shoot me? I told you I‚Äôd make this right.

Kaoru: Oh, drop the tough guy act! You think what you did will just go away if I take my revenge? To make things fair, I should kill you? You should know, nothing about life‚Äôs so black and white!

[She walks away. Kiryu stands and ponders until darkness falls. It is raining outside. Kiryu tries to light a soggy cigarette and flicks his lighter, remembering Kaoru‚Äôs words.]

Kaoru: (offscreen) To make things fair, I should kill you? You oughta know, nothing about life‚Äôs so black and white!

[An old man walks by with a bag of groceries. A jar falls out of the bag and Kiryu bends down to pick it up.]

Old Man: ‚Ä¶Sorry.

[When Kiryu gets up, the old man stabs him in the stomach and quietly walks away. The girl standing next to him starts screaming. The jar falls out of Kiryu‚Äôs hands. He falls to the planked platform, but finds the strength to get up and remove the knife from his stomach. He slowly walks away.]

Kiryu: (The blood‚Äôs not stopping! Was there poison on the knife? I‚Äôve gotta get to Aoi before I black out‚Ä¶)

[Kiryu slowly walks to Aoi and opens its door in the last of his strength. There‚Äôs Tamiyo and Kawara talking.]

Tamiyo: Hey! What happened!?

[Kiryu collapses. The scene changes and we get to Sengoku‚Äôs office.]

Toranosuke: I hear the Go-Ryu Clan put on a little show in Sotenbori?

Ryuji: The Koreans pulled that stunt on their own‚Ä¶

Toranosuke: No shit? They‚Äôre doin‚Äô so much of yer work, it‚Äôs hard to tell. Not that it got ya anywhere‚Ä¶

Ryuji: (puts his hand on the katana) You pickin‚Äô a fight?

Takashima: Don‚Äôt let him get to you.

[Ryuji takes his hand off his katana.]

Toranosuke: Look who‚Äôs all grown up now! Still, I‚Äôve got the Omi chairmanship in the bag.

[Some thug brings ties up Haruka to the room!!]

Toranosuke: Kiryu takes my bait, I take his head, bam!

Takashima: A plan that suits you, Sengoku.

Toranosuke: Hey, word on the street is Kiryu‚Äôs a tough nut to crack. (nasty laugh)

Ryuji: Suit your damn self. I‚Äôm takin‚Äô down Kiryu and the Tojo Clan my own way.

Toranosuke: Fuck yeah! Let the great race for the Omi throne begin!

[He laughs so hard it echoes in the night skies. Meanwhile Kiryu wakes up.]

Tamiyo: Hey, take it easy there, tough guy.

Kiryu: That man you were sitting with‚Ä¶ That was Kawara-san, wasn‚Äôt it?

Tamiyo: Oh, yeah. He was checkin‚Äô in on Kaoru.

Kiryu: What about her?

Tamiyo: Weeell‚Ä¶ Anyway, this is yours.

[She gives him a note.]

Kiryu: What is it?

Tamiyo: Don‚Äôt ask me. It was in your jacket.

Kiryu: When did this‚Ä¶

[He recalls his killer‚Ä¶]

Kiryu: That guy‚Ä¶ (reads the note) No‚Ä¶!

We have your precious child.
-Sengoku

Tamiyo: I know I can‚Äôt stop ya, but with that wound‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre pushin‚Äô your luck‚Ä¶

[Kiryu approaches the door, but stops.]

Kiryu: Has she been back here at all?

Tamiyo: You just leave worryin‚Äô after Kaoru to Kawara-san. Ya hear me? Be careful out there, sugar.

[But Kiryu leaves the bar. Someone calls him.]

Blocked Number: You Kiryu?

Kiryu: Who are you? And how‚Äôd you get this number?

Blocked Number: Those ain‚Äôt the questions that matter, fool. Ya want Haruka back? Then listen up.

Kiryu: Where is she!? If you‚Äôve hurt her‚Ä¶!

Blocked Number: No more questions. If ya want her back, get down to the Yokobori Golf Center. And come alone.

Kiryu: Hey! Who the hell is this?

[The caller hangs up.]

Kiryu: (The Yokobori Golf Center‚Ä¶ Fine. I could swear I‚Äôd heard that voice before, though.)

[Kiryu rushes to the Golf Center and meets some guy near the elevators.]

Unknown Man: ‚ÄòBout time you showed up. I thought y‚Äôactually cared about the little brat.

Kiryu: Where‚Äôs Haruka!? Did you leave Sengoku‚Äôs note!?

Unknown Man: Heh. You‚Äôre spewin‚Äô nonsense. Ain‚Äôt no matter anyway. Y‚Äôwon‚Äôt be leavin‚Äô this place alive!

[Enraged, Kiryu knocks the jerk to the floor.]

Kiryu: Where‚Äôs Haruka!? Where is Sengoku!?

Unknown Man: Ugh‚Ä¶ All I was told‚Ä¶ was t‚Äôkill you‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know nothin‚Äô past that‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Then who hired you!?

Unknown Man: Heh, well‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Say it, before I make sure you can‚Äôt!

Unknown Man: Gurgh! I get all my contracts online! Safer that way, man! I got no names!

Kiryu: Damn‚Ä¶

[Someone calls him.]

Kurokawa: Kiryu-han! Got some news for ya! Just wish it was good news‚Ä¶ Ya gotta get down to the river path, lickety-split! Meet me there, would ya?

Kiryu: Got it, Thanks, Kurokawa.

[He meets the flashy informator near the river.]

Kurokawa: Ahh, Kiryu-han. Glad you‚Äôre here, bud.

Kiryu: Yeah. What‚Äôs this about bad news? If this is about Haruka‚Ä¶

Kurokawa: Yeaaaah, that. ‚ÄôFraid I can‚Äôt tell ya.

Kiryu: What?

Kurokawa: See, I already got word that ya took out the heavy at the golf center. I called him out all the way from Hiroshima on this job. You‚Äôre a tough nut to crack, pal. Didn‚Äôt figure on you bein‚Äô that tough, though.

Kiryu: Wait, don‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶

Kurokawa: I got the distinct feelin‚Äô I shouldn‚Äôt let ya outta my sight‚Ä¶ You got the look of a man worth a whole mountain of cash, Kiryu-han. Figured it was only a matter of time ‚Äòtill I could find a way to collect on it. Well, today‚Äôs the day, boss. No hard feelings, I hope.

Kiryu: That was your doing!? How much have you known this whole time!?

Kurokawa: Feh‚Ä¶ Me n‚Äô my big mouth. Let‚Äôs cut the chitchat, shall we? Sorry, Kiryu-han‚Ä¶ Ya been good to me, bud. But I got money on the mind, y‚Äôknow? Well, let‚Äôs get ya strung up and put on the spit. My boys here won‚Äôt go down as easy as that clown from Hiroshima!

[Enraged by Haruka kidnapping and this betrayal, Kiryu beats Kurokawa and his girl scouts to a pulp.]

Kiryu: Where is Haruka!? And keep it short! And if I don‚Äôt like your answer, the river‚Äôs right here.

Kurokawa: I-It was Esaki‚Ä¶ He hired me‚Ä¶ Said if I sunk your ass, he‚Äôd give me 10 mil‚Ä¶I-I‚Äôve always been a sucker for cash. And ‚Äôsides, to do business in this town, ya gotta stay on Sengoku‚Äôs good side‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Where is he!?

Kurokawa: He‚Äôs hidin‚Äô out in the acupuncture clinic‚Ä¶

[Kiryu runs there.]

Acupuncturist: Hey, never seen your face in here before. What can I do ya for?

Kiryu: I found out there‚Äôs an acupuncture clinic here, so I figured I should get myself checked up.

Acupuncturist: Hahaha, we most certainly will. Lemme explain how it works. Acupunctures a special kinda treatment where we poke ya with little needles to stimulate pressure points on your body.

Kiryu: Sounds complicated.

Acupuncturist: Hahaha, not clickin for ya? Most patients don‚Äôt figure it out ‚Äòtil they actually have a session. Here, first session‚Äôs on me.

Kiryu: Are you sure?

Acupuncturist: ‚ÄòCourse I‚Äôm sure! Plus if ya end up bein‚Äô a regular, I more than recoup the cost.

Kiryu: Heh, not a bad deal for you. All right, I‚Äôm ready.

Acupuncturist: Okay. Just come on into the back room. Here we go. Ya just gotta take your shirt off ‚Äô lie facedown on the bed.

Kiryu: Okay.

[The screen goes black.]

Acupuncturist: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶All done!

Kiryu: What the‚Ä¶?

[Kiryu gets back to the reception.]

Acupuncturist: So? What‚Äôd ya think?

Kiryu: That was amazing. I feel light as a feather. Your needles definitely had an effect. I‚Äôm getting images of battle from within me. I like this. I‚Äôll back this place from now on.

Acupuncturist: Hmm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm happy ya say that, but it won‚Äôt have much effect if ya come too often, ya know?

Kiryu: Hm? What do you mean?

Acupuncturist: As I said in the beginnin‚Äô, my needles activate yer muscle memory and sublimate the experience into yer body. So in other words, if ya got no experience to sublimate then it‚Äôs no good, Even if ya get treatment, it ain‚Äôt gonna have an effect.

Kiryu: I see‚Ä¶

Acupuncturist: That‚Äôs why ya gotta come back when va stack up a buncha experiences. When that time comes, I‚Äôll treat ya right.

Kiryu: All right, I understand. Then I‚Äôm counting on you when that time comes.

[He notices Esaki in the clinic.]

Kiryu: Esaki!

Esaki: Rgh! How did‚Ä¶!?

[He runs away but Kiryu easily catches him.]

Kiryu: Hold it!

Esaki: ‚Ä¶Aw shit!

[Kiryu fights Esaki and crushes him like any other ordinary punk.]

Esaki: Nngh!

Kiryu: You‚Äôre out of places to run, so talk! Where is Sengoku? Where‚Äôs Haruka!?

Esaki: If I tell you, I may as well be signin‚Äô my own death warrant‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Then would you prefer to get a running start or lrt me sign it for you right now?

Esaki: Y-You wouldn‚Äôt! (his phone‚Äôs ringing) H-Hold on!! Hold on a sec‚Ä¶ Yes, hello? ‚Ä¶Huh? What!? Then what was I even‚Ä¶ B-But isn‚Äôt that..? Y-Yes, sir. I get it. (to Kiryu) Sengoku-han says I should bring ya to him. If I go, I‚Äôm dead for sure. Go by your damn self.

Kiryu: Where?

Esaki: Osaka Castle. You‚Äôll see when ya get there.

Kiryu: Osaka Castle‚Ä¶?

Esaki: Uh, hey, I know it‚Äôs a little late to ask, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm on borrowed time here‚Ä¶ Ya wouldn‚Äôt wanna protect me, would ya?

Kiryu: Yeah right. Try praying to Billiken over there.

Esaki: ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs over, I‚Äôm finished‚Ä¶

[Kiryu takes a cab to Osaka Castle. It SPLITS IN HALF REVEALING ANOTHER BUILDING. Kiryu enters it. There‚Äôs a bunch of armored soldiers and a Sengoku thug controlling them.]

Kiryu: Where is Haruka!?

Sengoku Thug: Up in the central tower. But, it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll be reachin‚Äô the top regardless. (to the soldiers) Put an end to this fucker‚Ä¶ Now!

[Kiryu makes his way through the classic Japanese castle, fighting soldiers, ninjas, dodging traps and much more. On the top of the castle the general awaits him.]

Toranosuke: Real damn impressive! Didn‚Äôt think ya‚Äôd make it this far.

Kiryu: Sengoku!

Toranosuke: Not so fast there‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Haruka! Let her go!

Toranosuke: Keep shoutin‚Äô like that, and yer gonna wake up my little pets.

[A couple of tigers walks in.]

Toranosuke: They tend to wake up kinda hungry‚Ä¶ Think ya might have a snack for ‚Äôem? How ‚Äôbout every bone in yer goddamn body!?

[Kiryu punches the tigers.]

Toranosuke: What are ya, some kinda monster!?

Kiryu: Give‚Ä¶ Haruka‚Ä¶ back!

[Sengoku runs away with Haruka. Kiryu easily catches him. Time to punch the pig I guess.]

Toranosuke: R-Ryuji!? What the fuck ya doing here!?

Ryuji: I gotta sympathize with ya‚Ä¶ Puttin‚Äô up with this chump‚Äôs games.

Toranosuke: H-Hey, what‚Äôd ya call me!?

[Ryuji slashes him with his katana.]

Toranosuke: Y-You crazy fuck!

Ryuji: Naw, just a man willin‚Äô to do what it takes, same as you. But takin‚Äô a kid hostage? That‚Äôs pretty low.

Toranosuke: A man my ass! You‚Äôd be nothing if not for yer daddy!

Ryuji: Shut the fuck up!

[He pierces the fat Toranosuke‚Äôs body with his katana and throws him off the castle.]

Ryuji: Finally, some peace n‚Äô quiet.

[He releases Haruka.]

Ryuji: Day after tomorrow‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre comin‚Äô at Kamurocho with all we‚Äôve got. You ready?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Ryuji: Later, then.

[He leaves. Kiryu unties Haruka.]

Kiryu: You must have been scared. I‚Äôm sorry. Sorry I let this happen to you again‚Ä¶

[He bends down in pain.]

Haruka: What‚Äôs wrong!?

Kiryu: I‚Äôll be fine.

Haruka: Stay strong, Uncle Kaz!

[Kaoru suddenly runs in!]

Kaoru: Looks like that wound must‚Äôve reopened.

Haruka: What? He‚Äôs hurt?

Kaoru: He‚Äôll be good as new soon. I promise.

Haruka: Thank goodness.

Kiryu: Why did‚Ä¶ you follow me?

Kaoru: Mama told me about the note you got.

Kiryu: I see‚Ä¶

Kaoru: I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre all right. Always gotta act so tough‚Ä¶ This guy!

[But‚Ä¶ someone watches them from the shadow‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs Kawara!]

Chapter 13: SETTLING ACCOUNTS
[The gang are back to Aoi. Kiryu‚Äôs stomach is mended.]

Haruka: There, all better.

Kiryu: Thank you.

[Kaoru reads a note lying on the counter.]

Kaoru: What? What‚Äôs this?

Kiryu: What‚Äôs wrong?

Kaoru: This note Mama left me‚Ä¶

Kiryu: What does it say?

Kaoru: ‚ÄúYour dad is still alive, honey. Don‚Äôt blame Kiryu-san.‚Äù

Kiryu: He‚Äôs alive?

Kaoru: If he‚Äôs still alive, then who and where is he!? And why is Mama writing me notes and running off?

Kiryu: You haven‚Äôt seen Tamiyo-san lately?

Kaoru: I‚Äôll search the neighborhood.

[She leaves.]

Haruka: Who is she looking for?

Kiryu: The lady who raised her.

[Kiryu dresses up.]

Kiryu: Is this your first time in Kansai, Haruka?

Haruka: Yeah, I didn‚Äôt get to go on too many trips or anything.

Kiryu: Right‚Ä¶ Well, what do you say we go exploring for a bit?

Haruka: Can we? Yaaay! Let‚Äôs go, Uncle Kaz!

[They walk through the night straits of Sotenbori.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz, Uncle Kaz! Look, that‚Äôs Sakura!

Kiryu: Hm? She a friend of yours?

Haruka: Noooo, it‚Äôs Sakura Fukunaga‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs a super-famous actress.

Sakura: See ya, hun. Looking forward to this drama deal.

Producer: Ehhh, you know it, babe! It‚Äôs in the bag! Talk soon!

[Sakura leaves in her car.]

Haruka: She was really pretty, huh?

Kiryu: Hmm‚Ä¶?

[The producer notices Haruka.]

Producer: Hey, miss! You there, little angel! You‚Äôre the goose‚Äôs golden egg! A diamond in the rough! I can tell! A girl like you comes around maybe once a decade‚Ä¶ No way‚Ä¶ More like‚Ä¶ Once a century! You‚Äôre a star in the making!

Haruka: Mister, who are you and what are you trying to get from me?

Producer: Haven‚Äôt ya ever dreamed of bein‚Äô a star, angel? Becomin‚Äô a real celeb? Of course ya have! Everybody does.

Kiryu: Haruka, what‚Äôs going on?

Producer: You this angel‚Äôs daddy? I ain‚Äôt nobody suspicious, so allow me to introduce myself here. I‚Äôm the president of Sotenbori Productions, friend.

Kiryu: And that is?

Producer: We‚Äôre a talent agency! And sir, I say your girl here‚Äôs got the wings of an angel, and with our help, she could learn to soar. Whaddaya think? I can practically guarantee she‚Äôd be one of the hottest acts in Japan.

Kiryu: A little girl like Haruka?

Producer: Yeah! Say, our office is just over yonder., Whaddaya say we have a quick chat?

Haruka: (sighs) Let‚Äôs just keep walking, Uncle Kaz.

Producer: Ahh, hey! A quick chat won‚Äôt hurt, pal! If you‚Äôre in a rush, I‚Äôd be happy to reschedule! Here, here, let‚Äôs do this. Ya got a cell on ya, pops?

Kiryu: Sure.

Producer: Thanks! Let‚Äôs see here‚Ä¶

[He turns away and takes some coke I guess?]

Kiryu: H-Hey!

Producer: Alrighty, that‚Äôll do it! I just gave ya my direct number. When you want to see your girl shine, you just give me a call! I‚Äôll wait!

[He walks away.]

Kiryu: You sure, Haruka?

Haruka: Yeah, I don‚Äôt know about that.

[They continue to walk around the city. When Kiryu and Haruka enter a bridge, Kiryu‚Äôs phone starts ringing.]

Producer: Hello? This is Sotenbori Productions. The president, to be specific.

Kiryu: That talent agency?

Producer: Yeah, I‚Äôm callin ‚Äòbout your little girl.

Kiryu: How‚Äôd you get my number?

Producer: I memorized it when I put my number in your phone, pal. I‚Äôve got this game doan, sir, and I couldn‚Äôt let that little girl slip through the cracks.

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Producer: I can‚Äôt get the little angel outta my head! I‚Äôve gotta say, this is the first time I‚Äôve felt such a gravitational pull. She‚Äôs gonna be big. Huge, even! I‚Äôve got the instinct for this. I can personally assure ya that she‚Äôll live out her dreams. Can I convince ya to at least hear me out? Whenever you‚Äôre free, would ya swing by the office with her? I‚Äôll wait. However long it takes, I wait.

Kiryu: I‚Äôll think about it‚Ä¶

[Kiryu goes to the office of the producer. He sees some thug talking to a girl.]

Thug: C‚Äômon, babe. Give it a damn rest!

Young Woman: I said it before n‚Äô I‚Äôll say it again. You agents are all crooks! I did everythin‚Äô y‚Äôall said, and I still got no debut?

Thug: Oh, don‚Äôt give me that! Only reason ya didn‚Äôt get a debut is ‚Äòcause ya didn‚Äôt put in the effort! Ya know what they say, babe. The product ain‚Äôt gonna sell itself. Takes hard work and perseverance. Can‚Äôt expect everythin‚Äô handed to ya, right?

Young Woman: I don‚Äôt need to take this! Give it back! Give me back my money! It‚Äôs like a sick joke. Registration fees, lesson fees, head shot costs‚Ä¶ It all adds up. They think I‚Äôm just gonna roll over and let them take everything from me? I‚Äôm gettin‚Äô it back, I swear.

[Kiryu walks to the entrance of the office.]

Kiryu: Wait here a sec, Haruka.

Haruka: Okay.

Producer: Ahh, I been waitin‚Äô! Please, please, have a seat.

Kiryu: I‚Äôm only here to let you say what you wanted to say. Don‚Äôt make any assumptions.

Producer: Yes yes yes. And thank ya for doin‚Äô so! See, how it works is, we‚Äôll take the young lady into our care, and put her into trainin‚Äô. Acting lessons, voice training, dance lessons‚Ä¶ She‚Äôd learn all the tools to make her idol debut. We‚Äôd also negotiate a killer contract on her behalf. And of course, we wouldn‚Äôt neglect her studies. Our girls go to only the top notch schools in the area.

Kiryu: Sounds awfully generous.

Producer: Of course it is! We invest in her future for our modest cut down the road. And that li‚Äôl lady‚Äôs gonna be a star. I can feel it in my bones. If I‚Äôm bein‚Äô honest, we‚Äôll make back what we put in to her ten fold. I‚Äôd have no regrets about spoilin‚Äô her rotten now. My instincts haven‚Äôt steered me wrong yet!

Kiryu: I still can‚Äôt imagine Haruka in show business. I want her to live a good, honest life.

Producer: I understand that, pal. Any father would worry for his little girl. Ya toss her into show biz, full of those big headed yakuza types‚Ä¶ I really do understand‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yakuza types, huh? (Haruka has been kidnapped four times now‚Ä¶ Even with me around to protect her. No‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not protecting her. I‚Äôm the very reason she‚Äôs in danger. It‚Äôs my fault she gets wrapped up in these things.)

Producer: So whaddaya say? Can ya trust me to care for your little girl?

Give me some time to think.
This could be in Haruka‚Äôs best interest‚Ä¶ +

Kiryu: You might be right‚Ä¶ This could be in Haruka‚Äôs best interest‚Ä¶

Producer: Eh, ya know it is! Now, lemme just draft up some paperwork!

Kiryu: This is going to be tough‚Ä¶

Haruka: Aaaah!

Kiryu: Haruka!?

[Kiryu goes outside. The same bald thug who was talking to the girl outside the office is now squatting and talking to Haruka. A few of his buddies are standing next to him.]

Kiryu: Who are those guys?

Producer: Fools from a rival agency. Real pieces of work, these guys. They got Omi backing, so they think they run the biz here‚Ä¶

Thug: (to Haruka) C‚Äômon, guys. Don‚Äôt let this chump sucker ya into a bum deal. Our agency‚Äôll take way better care of ya!

Kiryu: Haruka!

Haruka: Uncle Kaz, help!

Kiryu: Hang on, Haruka. These punks need some lessons in how to do business.

Thug: The fuck!? You talk pretty tough, gramps!

[Kiryu teaches them how to behave.]

Producer: (clapping) Wow, incredible! Now, we were about to move to contract signing, as I recall. Let‚Äôs go back inside. You too, angel.

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶

Haruka: What contract, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Producer: We just took the next step toward your future, angel! You‚Äôre gonna be an idol! You‚Äôre gonna shine so bright, your daddy here‚Äôs gonna need shades! You‚Äôll be at a top-ranked school, livin‚Äô like a princess!

Haruka: (to Kiryu) How could you just decide that? This isn‚Äôt funny!

Producer: Naw, you‚Äôre daddy‚Äôs only doin‚Äô it for your sake, angel!

Haruka: I‚Äôm happy just the way things are!

Kiryu: Haruka, listen.

Haruka: No! Uncle Kaz‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre abandoning me? I don‚Äôt want to be alone any more‚Ä¶

Kiryu: That‚Äôs not it. I‚Äôm the one giving you reasons to be scared‚Ä¶

Haruka: But I‚Äôm not scared. You‚Äôve been there to keep me safe. If you leave me here, I‚Äôll find you on my own. I‚Äôll go all the way to Kamurocho if I have to.

Kiryu: Haruka‚Ä¶

Haruka: So let‚Äôs go home!

Producer: Ah! H-Hey, hold up, now! All that talkin‚Äô, and I get zilch!? You‚Äôre killin‚Äô me, big guy! My golden egg‚Ä¶! My diamond in the rough‚Ä¶!

Haruka: Sorry, Mr. President!

Producer: That‚Äôs the smile! That right there! That would get ya off a murder charge! You‚Äôre carryin‚Äô a secret weapon!

Haruka: Bye bye!

Producer: Goodbye, little one! Oh my god! Did I really just fall for that!? Ya ain‚Äôt seen the last of me! Mark my words!

[Kiryu and Haruka continue to stroll around Sotenbori.]

Girlfriend: Hey, remember that girl with the amazin‚Äô voice?

Boyfriend: The one who always practiced down by the river?

Girlfriend: Yeah, did ya know she works at that bar? I think it‚Äôs called Stijl.

Boyfriend: Does she sing for folks who go drinkin‚Äô in there? We should drop in sometime!

[Kiryu and Haruka go to Stijl. The waiter appears to be the same girl the thug was talking near the agency.]

Male Customer: What, ya don‚Äôt do requests, girly!? That how this goes!?

Female Staff: Sir, I‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just so sudden. I-I‚Äî

Male Customer: Shut up n‚Äô sing already!

Female Staff: No, I‚Äôm not a good singer, I‚Ä¶

Male Customer: Don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre tone-deaf! How hard is it to get some damn singin‚Äô here!?

Female Staff: I don‚Äôt want to disturb anyone else here‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ (bows)

Kiryu: Hey, quit pestering her. You expect her to sing when she‚Äôs this uncomfortable?

Male Customer: Feh! Talk about yer buzz kills. I‚Äôm done here, and I ain‚Äôt never comin‚Äô back!

Female Staff: I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ That was so embarrassing.

Kiryu: It wasn‚Äôt your fault. Don‚Äôt worry about it.

[Haruka and Kiryu leave the bar and walk some more. They find the girl from Stijl looking at the river.]

Kiryu: You enjoy singing, I take it?

Female Staff: Oh, you‚Äôre the man from the bar.

Kiryu: You‚Äôve got a great voice. Why don‚Äôt you have more confidence?

Female Staff: I‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Female Staff: I‚Ä¶ I do love to sing. I wanted to do it professionally for a while. I even took a bunch of voice lessons. I was almost sure I was on the cusp of my big debut‚Ä¶ But I should have known better. My agency was conning me‚Ä¶

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Female Staff: All of a sudden, I was knee-deep in debt, and it took a toll on my family‚Ä¶ I was out on the streets when the owner of that bar took me in.

Kiryu: That‚Äôs really terrible, and I‚Äôm sorry. But you still want to sing, don‚Äôt you? All the bad luck in the world shouldn‚Äôt make your dream less worth pursuing.

Female Staff: That‚Äôs beautiful, but idealistic, too. How could I tell that to this barkeeper? He‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm even alive. I‚Äôm sorry. I ought to be going.

[Kiryu and Haruka continue walking around Sotenbori and encounter the producer again.]

Producer: Ahh, I been lookin‚Äô everywhere for ya!

Haruka: You still don‚Äôt get it, mister!?

Producer: Ahaha! If persistence is what it takes to change your mind, then I ain‚Äôt afraid to pull out all the stops!

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Producer: Ah, then allow me to sweeten the pot a bit. I‚Äôll pay your signin‚Äô bonus up front! 10 million yen!

Kiryu: This isn‚Äôt about money. You‚Äôre going to have to forget about her.

Producer: Mmmmrghh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll double it! 20 million! That‚Äôs a sum that‚Äôd make anyone think twice!

Kiryu: You know what‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs someone I‚Äôd like you to meet, now that I think about it.

Producer: Eh? What‚Äôs all this about, pal?

Kiryu: Be quiet and follow me, would you?

[He leads the producer to the riverbank.]

Female Staff: ‚ô™ Lord, prayers I will raise, I am generous with praise Heaven knows what‚Äôs going on ‚ô™

Producer: Holy smoke! What a voice! The angels are cryin‚Äô and the tears are piercin‚Äô my heart! My spine‚Äôs shiverin! She‚Äôs exactly what I been searchin‚Äô for! A million-seller! I can feel it!

Kiryu: Your agency‚Äôll give her the same life you promised for Haruka?

Producer: Gahaha! My man, I have heard the siren‚Äôs song and I am entranced! She ain‚Äôt slippin‚Äô away! I need paperwork, right now! Gonna just call up my boys real quick! This is happenin‚Äô!

Haruka: Good for you, mister!

Kiryu: Haruka‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs head back to Aoi.

Haruka: Good idea, Uncle Kaz.

[Hey grab a bite and return to Aoi.]

Haruka: We‚Äôre going back to Kamurocho soon, right, Uncle Kaz? Are you sure you don‚Äôt wanna do anything else here first? It would be a shame to leave with loose ends‚Ä¶ Sooo‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre ready to go, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: I‚Äôm all set, Haruka.

Haruka: Okay, great!

[Kiryu phone‚Äôs ringing.]

Kiryu: This is Kiryu. You‚Äôve taken Date-san hostage?

Kurahashi: Now, now. Calm down and listen.

Kiryu: Who is this?

Kurahashi: Tokyo PD Division Two‚Äôs Wataru Kurahashi.

Kiryu: Kurahashi from Foreign Affairs?

Kurahashi: Well, 20 years ago, it wasn‚Äôt Kurahashi. I was "Yeongmin Ji" then.

Kiryu: So you‚Äôre another Jingweon survivor.

Kurahashi: Exactly.

Kiryu: Did you take Date-san on Go-Ryu orders?

Kurahashi: No, they‚Äôve got nothing to do with this. The time is finally ripe for the Jingweon Mafia to strike. We will have vengeance for the cruel deaths of our brothers 26 years ago.

[Kaoru enters.]

Kiryu: Date-san had nothing to do with it!

Kurahashi: He‚Äôs unfortunately just the bait we need to gather all the players.

Kiryu: Gather them? Who are you after?

Kurahashi: The people who ruined our lives 26 years ago. You‚Äôll be joining us too, won‚Äôt you?

Kiryu: Where?

Kurahashi: The heart of Kamurocho.

Kiryu: The Millennium Tower‚Ä¶

Kurahashi: Please arrive by dawn. Otherwise, I‚Äôm afraid the entire building will go up in smoke this time,

Kiryu: Fine. I‚Äôll be there.

Kurahashi: Ah, one more thing. Please make sure Kaoru Sayama comes along.

Kiryu: Why?

Kurahashi: (laughs) You‚Äôll know soon enough‚Ä¶ (hungs up)

Kaoru: I just got a call from the chief. He said they‚Äôve taken Date-san.

Kiryu: That was the guy who took him just now. How could a man in his position be a Jingweon survivor‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Kurahashi from Foreign Affairs, right? So? What‚Äôd he want from you?

Kiryu: Us. At the Millennium Tower, by dawn.

Kaoru: The Shinkansen doesn‚Äôt run this late. We‚Äôll have to drive!

[Meanwhile, Kawara is driving somewhere in the car and talking to Bessho on the phone. Tamiyo is holding the phone for him.]

Kawara: I‚Äôm heading to Kamurocho now. Looks like we were right‚Ä¶

Bessho: Yeah‚Ä¶ Shit hit the fan. We‚Äôll keep the Omi Alliance in check, long as we can.

Kawara: Good, thanks. Leave Kurahashi to me.

Bessho: They got nothin‚Äô left to lose this time‚Ä¶ Watch yer back up there.

Kawara: Will do. (hungs up)

Tamiyo: If she finds out she‚Äôs got that accursed blood in her, Kaoru might‚Äî

Kawara: I‚Äôm not letting that happen. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been hunting them down for the last 26 years.

[Haruka, Kiryu and Kaoru, meanwhile, drive the van to Kamurocho. Kiryu falls asleep in the back seat.]

Haruka: He‚Äôs pretty tired, huh?

Kaoru: You like your Uncle Kiryu a lot, huh, Haruka-chan?

Haruka: Yup. He‚Äôs always there to protect me. Do you, Kaoru-san?

Kaoru: I‚Äôm just with "Uncle Kiryu" for work. I‚Äôm here, like him or not.

Haruka: But he sure seems to like you, Kaoru-san.

Kaoru: What‚Ä¶?

Haruka: He acts different around you than he does around other people.

Kaoru: Different how?

Haruka: He acts‚Ä¶ like he does around me, I guess.

Kaoru: And how does he act around you?

Haruka: He‚Äôs usually quiet, but he‚Äôs really nice. People are always asking for his help, and he pushes himself really hard for them. I guess he doesn‚Äôt have to worry when he‚Äôs with you, so he can just be himself.

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶I see. You‚Äôre pretty mature, Haruka-chan.

Haruka: I don‚Äôt think so. Last year we went through a lot of sad stuff, that‚Äôs all. Nowadays I can sorta understand how he feels.

[Someone shoots off the van‚Äôs rear-view mirror. Kiryu wakes up.]

Kiryu: What happened!?

Kaoru: They tailed us!

Kiryu: Floor it and keep driving!

[Kiryu opens the van door and jumps onto the platform of the truck chasing them. There are a bunch of Jingweon mafioso standing on the platform. Kiryu crushes them.]

Haruka: Hey, we‚Äôre‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ Serena.

Kaoru: We‚Äôve gotta move. Time‚Äôs almost up. Let‚Äôs hurry!

Kiryu: Can you wait here, Haruka?

Haruka: Okay. Be careful, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: I will.

[He and Kaoru walks out of Serena.]

Kaoru: Kurahashi wants me to come to the Millennium Tower too, right?

Kiryu: Yeah, he said we‚Äôd find out once we got there‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Why would he want me there, though? ‚ÄòCause of the Jingweon blood I have? I guess there‚Äôs no point taking stabs in the dark.

Kiryu: There‚Äôs not much time. Let‚Äôs head to the Millennium Tower.

Go to the Millennium Tower
[Kiryu and Kaoru run to rescue Date. They go up to the 50th floor and find that all the Florist‚Äôs equipment is ruined.]

Kurahashi: Welcome, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre Kurahashi?

[Kaoru aims at Kurahashi. In the corner of the room we see the tied Date, the Florist and his staff.]

Date: Don‚Äôt shoot! He‚Äôs got the place wired to blow!

Kurahashi: Precisely.

[One of Florist‚Äôs employees, a traitor who arranged a power outage, removes a rag from a huge bomb.]

Kaoru: So why‚Äôd you call me here?

Kurahashi: You‚Äôre one of the stars in this little tale of revenge.

Kaoru: Because I have Jingweon blood in me?

Kurahashi: You already know? Then join us in avenging the massacre of our brothers 26 years ago.

[Kawara and Tamiyo appear. Kawara points his gun at Kurahashi.]

Kawara: Don‚Äôt listen to him! Don‚Äôt assume she‚Äôs anything like you!

Kaoru: What‚Äôs going on here!?

Kawara: Kurahashi‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had you marked since the day you took Japanese citizenship and joined the force. That‚Äôs why I ditched Division One to follow you to Foreign Affairs. I figured I‚Äôd let you go if you could abandon the creed, but you couldn‚Äôt, huh? I never should have let a bastard like you out of my sights.

Kurahashi: I have no interest in your little speech! Take a step closer, and I‚Äôll blow this entire building to dust.

Kawara: Go ahead and push the button. You scraped by for 20 years, living a lie just to stay alive. You don‚Äôt have the balls.

Kurahashi: Are you so sure!? I would gladly die for revenge! That‚Äôs the Jingweon creed!

[He tries to press the button, but Kawara knocks the remote control out of his hands with a shot.]

Kawara: Don‚Äôt give me that creed bullshit. You remember Murai? Korean named Hoejong Park. He lived under the weight of what he‚Äôd done. Robbery, arson, murder‚Ä¶ Looking back on what you all did, it only proves he actually had a soul. But you‚Äôd say he deserved to die for breaking the creed? This madness needs to stop. Murai is dead. Once I take care of you and Daejin, it‚Äôll all be over. (prepares to kill Kurahashi)

Date: Don‚Äôt!

Kawara: You stay out of this! If I don‚Äôt finish this here, more innocent blood will spill later!

Kurahashi: (laugh) You could kill a man with your daughter watching?

Kaoru: Wait. What does he mean, your daughter? Don‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶

Kurahashi: Yes, I‚Äôm talking about you. Kaoru Sayama-san.

Kaoru: What? You? ‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre my father?

Kawara: He‚Äôs lying! Just stay back!

[Kurahashi uses the moment and shoots Kawara in the shoulder.]

Kurahashi: He and the boss‚Äôs wife, Suyeon Jung, got together and had a kid. You. Your father is this man‚Ä¶ Jiro Kawara!

Kawara: Shut your damn mouth!

[Kurahashi shots him multiple times. Tamiyo rushes to Kawara.]

Tamiyo: Kawara-san!

Kurahashi: Kawara!

Kawara: Only one thing has kept me going through the hell of these last 26 years‚Ä¶ The revenge I take today! I know you slaughtered my brethren who came over from Korea, too! I‚Äôll put a bullet in you for every one of them you murdered!

[Kaoru stands in his way.]

Kurahashi: You would violate the Jingweon creed?

Kaoru: Your creed‚Äôs got nothing to do with me!

Kurahashi: Fine‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll send you to hell alongside your father!

[Kiryu rushes to Kurahashi to punch him. The traitor pulls out his gun, but Kaoru shoots him first in the arm. The traitor runs away. Kurahashi is disarmed and grappled.]

Kiryu: This town has had enough of the Jingweon Mafia!

Kurahashi: Ah, the bastard son of the Dojima Family.

Kiryu: Since Kazama-san can‚Äôt do it himself‚Ä¶ You get to deal with me.

Kurahashi: Interesting‚Ä¶

[A couple of mafioso enters. Kurahashi breaks free.]

Kurahashi: We will have our vengeance! This ends here and now!

Kiryu: You‚Äôll have to go through me!

Kurahashi: Kill him!

[Kiryu punches Kurahashi and his boys to a bloody mess after which he unties Date. Kurahashi stretches to the detonator.]

Kaoru: Move and I‚Äôll shoot!

[Kurahashi stealthily pulls out a gun.]

Kurahashi: Die!

[Kawara covers her with her body. Kurahashi only had one bullet. Kaoru helps Kawara‚Äôs weakening hand to aim at Kurohashi and kill him.]

Date: Kawara-san!

Kaoru: You saved me‚Ä¶ Thank you.

Kawara: I got to act like a father.

Kaoru: Why didn‚Äôt you ever tell me?

Kawara: I wanted to‚Ä¶ respect your mother‚Äôs wishes.

Kaoru: Her wishes?

Kawara: I first met her that night‚Ä¶ The night of the raid‚Ä¶

[He recalls that fateful night of mass murder in which he helped a mother with her child.]

Kaoru‚Äôs Mother: [Stay back! I won‚Äôt let you take my baby!]

[She carries little Kaoru to the window to drop her off.]

Kawara: Don‚Äôt!

Suyeon: [Let me go! Just let us die!]

Kawara: (slaps her) That kid‚Äôs innocent. Don‚Äôt just throw his life away.

[He helps them leave the burning building.]

Kawara: (offscreen) I knew Suyeon would be in danger in Kamurocho. Bessho and I snuck her down to Kansai‚Ä¶ I checked in on her about six months later. It was like that horrible night had cut a hole right through her heart. She was falling apart at the seams‚Ä¶

Kaoru: What happened to her child?

Kawara: She gave him up through her tears.

Date: Gave him up?

Kawara: In the shape she was in, Suyeon wouldn‚Äôt have lasted. I found work for her. Tried to help her build a new life‚Ä¶

Kawara: (offscreen) Before we knew it, we were living together. Then, Kaoru‚Ä¶ You were born.

Young Kawara: I think I‚Äôll turn down the Hong Kong post.

Suyeon: Why?

Young Kawara: I can‚Äôt just leave you two here.

Suyeon: It‚Äôs only a year, silly! It‚Äôs for your career, so we‚Äôll make do. Just go, and don‚Äôt fret about us. Grow up strong while Daddy‚Äôs gone, and well all have fun when he comes back!

Kawara: (offscreen) But, while I was gone‚Ä¶ Suyeon was murdered.

Kaoru: By who?

Kawara: Jingweon men, sent in from the mainland‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs when I set out to kill off every Jingweon man still in Japan‚Ä¶

Date: So that‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ All those illegal aliens you shot were‚Ä¶

Kawara: All Jingweon men.

Date: Revenge for Suyeon‚Äôs death?

Kawara: Not just that. I needed to erase Kaoru‚Äôs past.

Kaoru: My past?

Tamiyo: Before she died, your real ma came to me. She wanted ya set free from the curse of your past‚Ä¶

Kaoru: That was her dying wish?

Tamiyo: Afraid so‚Ä¶ Then she gave ya to me, someone with no connections to the Jingweon at all. And poor Kawara-san had to keep his distance from ya too.

Kaoru: But you called Mama sometimes, right?

Kawara: Yeah‚Ä¶ And you picked up on the Tojo Clan from one of those blasted calls. Dragged you right back in‚Ä¶

Tamiyo: That was all my fault. I didn‚Äôt know Kaoru was there.

[We plunge into memories. Little Kaoru overhears Tamiyo talking over the phone.]

Tamiyo: I don‚Äôt know what happened, but I know this! The Tojo Clan made Kaoru‚Äôs life a livin‚Äô hell!

[Back to the present.]

Kaoru: No, I‚Äôm happier knowing. Not knowing who you are‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs nothin‚Äô scarier.

Kawara: Sorry‚Ä¶

Kaoru: After the raid‚Ä¶ What happened to my mom‚Äôs other child?

Kawara: I‚Äôm afraid‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not my place to say‚Ä¶ Just‚Ä¶ remember this, Kaoru. The blood running through your veins isn‚Äôt Jingweon blood. It‚Äôs kind, hard-working, and strong‚Ä¶ Like Suyeon.

Kaoru: Like you, Kawara-san. It‚Äôs your blood too, Dad.

Kawara: (smirks) This takes me back‚Ä¶ Holding your hand‚Ä¶ You used to grab my fingers and laugh‚Ä¶ Your hands were so tiny‚Ä¶ For me, for your mother‚Ä¶ Find your happiness.

Kaoru: Dad‚Ä¶

Kawara: Thanks‚Ä¶ kiddo.

[He dies. Everyone puts their heads down and keeps quiet. Kaoru bursts into tears.]

Chapter 14: THE GO-RYU MARCH
[Kiryu and The Florist walking around a port. There‚Äôs a sign over their heads ÂÆâÂÖ®Á¨¨‰∏Ä (Safety First).]

The Florist: Guess I‚Äôm back where I‚Äôm meant to be.

Kiryu: Yeah, so it seems.

The Florist: Me and my boys are better at lurking below the surface than lording from above anyway.

[Date hands Kawara‚Äôs packed ashes to Kaoru.]

Date: Kawara-san was a good cop to the last.

Kaoru: I‚Äôm glad I knew my dad‚Ä¶ Even if it wasn‚Äôt for very long.

Tamiyo: We‚Äôll put him to rest next to Suyeon.

Kaoru: Good idea‚Ä¶ I think he‚Äôd want it that way.

Tamiyo: Leave it to me, honey.

Kaoru: I put ya through a lot‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry.

Tamito: (almost crying) Hush now, child. It‚Äôs all part of bein‚Äô yer mama.

Kaoru: Mhm.

Date: (to Kiryu)  I‚Äôm still wondering about the kid Sayama‚Äôs mother gave up 26 years ago.

Kiryu: Same. If the Jingweon got to him, he could be involved in all this somehow.

The Florist: That, and the rat in my office got away.

Kiryu: We‚Äôre not finished with the Jingweon just yet.

Date: (pulls out a CD) If we can analyze this, maybe we‚Äôll find a lead. Kurahashi had it on him.

The Florist:Nicked it before the cops searched the body?

Date: Yeah. Maybe she can crack it open.

[Kaoru and Tamiyo mourn for Kawara. The scene changes to Ryuji‚Äôs limousine.]

Go-Ryu Thug: (on a phone) Got it. We just left Osaka too. We should be there by tonight. Later. (to Ryuji) Five heaping truckloads of weapons just pulled into Kamurocho, boss.

Ryuji: Good. Not long then?

Go-Ryu Thug: Right.

Ryuji: Bustin‚Äô in to Kamurocho‚Äôs been on the Omi‚Äôs to-do list for ages. Not even the old man could check it off.

Go-Ryu Thug: And now the Go-Ryu Clan will finally drive the wedge into Kamurocho.

Ryuji: Yeah. This‚Äôll be my stagin‚Äô ground to take down every yakuza clan ‚Äôcross the nation. Then, I‚Äôll become the one true dragon. (to himself) Watch close, pops. I‚Äôm ‚Äôbout to do what you couldn‚Äôt.

[The camera zooms out and we see a good 20 limousines driving down a six-lane road! It‚Äôs gonna be a fierce battle! The scene changes to Takashima;s office. He talks on the phone with someone.]

Takashima: Everything‚Äôs going according to plan.

Man: Don‚Äôt celebrate just yet.

Takashima: You have no business patronizing me. I‚Äôll head up when the time is right. Bye. (hungs up) Enter.

Takashima Thug: Excuse me, boss. The Go-Ryu Clan has finally mobilized against Kamurocho, sir.

Takashima: I see.

Takashima Thug: They‚Äôll beat us to the punch, sir.

Takashima: Don‚Äôt get too excited.

Takashima Thug: But, boss‚Ä¶

Takashima: We‚Äôll make our move eventually. There‚Äôs plenty of time. And don‚Äôt forget‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve got an ace in the hole.

[Meanwhile in Purgatory‚Ä¶ Kaoru using a notebook to read the CD.]

Kaoru: No dice.

Date: No dice?

Kaoru: Yeah. I can‚Äôt seem to brute force this password. I‚Äôll need a special application that‚Äôs not on this PC.

Date: I see‚Ä¶

Date: It is what it is.

Date: Wait‚Ä¶ Isn‚Äôt there still‚Ä¶

The Florist: What?

Date: Couldn‚Äôt you read it using the system downtown?

Kaoru: At police HQ?

Date: Yeah. We‚Äôve got a high-tech crime unit up here, too. Maybe their system could decrypt it.

The Florist: But Tokyo PD‚Äôs not exactly on our side on this one.

Date: That‚Äôs the tricky part. I‚Äôm in no position to be calling in favors myself‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Guess that‚Äôs out, then.

The Florist: Wait a sec‚Ä¶ Why not use Osaka‚Äôs system?

Kaoru: What?

Date: Yeah, that could work! Sayama, where are you off to next?

Kaoru: Um‚Ä¶ I was gonna head back home with Mama.

Date: That‚Äôs perfect. Take this down to the office and have a crack at it. You‚Äôd have the tools there, right?

Kaoru: Uh‚Ä¶ Yeah, probably.

Date: Good, then it‚Äôs all you.

[Kaoru takes the CD, looks sadly at Kiyu and leaves.]

Kiryu: (Something was off about Sayama‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs not okay with all this‚Ä¶)

Find Sayama
[He finds Kaoru at Serena. She sits at the counter.]

Kaoru: Oh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs you. Sorry, I kinda let myself in.

Kiryu: It‚Äôs fine.

[She takes a sip of beer. Kiryu lights a cigarette.]

Kaoru: What‚Äôs up? Got something you want to tell me?

Kiryu: Not really.

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶Oh.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre headed back to Kansai?

Kaoru: Yeah. After all that I can‚Äôt leave Mama by herself. I wanna see her home safely.

Kiryu: Yeah. Good thinking.

Kaoru: Still, kinda feels like I‚Äôm running away at the climax here.

Kiryu: No, don‚Äôt worry about us.

Kaoru: I guess‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt need my protective custody now. (losing her shit) Dammit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶

Kiryu: You‚Äôre‚Ä¶

Kaoru: I‚Äôm scared.

Kiryu: Hm?

Kaoru: Of finding out anything else about all this. I‚Äôve never felt this before. I was so eager to dig up my past‚Ä¶ I thought I could handle whatever turned up. But‚Ä¶ You hit the nail on the head. All it did was hurt. But hindsight is 20/20, right?

Kiryu: You‚Äôll be fine.

Kaoru: Huh?

[Kiryu suddenly kisses her.]

Kiryu: What you find out doesn‚Äôt matter. I would never think less of you. So promise me‚Ä¶ That whatever happens, you‚Äôll come back. ‚Ä¶Back here.

Kaoru: Okay‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶I promise. Well, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going back to Osaka for now. I‚Äôll head straight for the station and check out this disk, okay? I can‚Äôt imagine the system there having any trouble with it.

Kiryu: That‚Äôs good‚Ä¶

Kaoru: I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs on this, but‚Ä¶ No matter what it is‚Ä¶ Even if it‚Äôs more pain‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm ready to accept it.

Kiryu: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Hey.

Kiryu: Hm?

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶Thank you. Alright, I‚Äôm off, then.

[She leaves. Kiryu phone‚Äôs ringing.]

Date: Hey, Kiryu.

Kiryu: What‚Äôs up?

Date: I just got word from Dr. Emoto. I guess Kazuki‚Äôs awake.

Kiryu: Really? That‚Äôs great to hear.

Date: Yeah, but apparently he‚Äôs talking a little crazy.

Kiryu: You mean he‚Äôs delirious?

Date: He‚Äôs been babbling about bombs‚Ä¶ Anyway, I‚Äôm headed to the clinic. See you there?

Kiryu: Yeah.

[Kiryu goes to Emoto Clinic.]

Emoto: Hey, there you are.

Kiryu: Kazuki‚Ä¶

Kazuki: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ Sorry to drag you over here‚Ä¶

Kiryu: It‚Äôs fine. More importantly, how are you feeling?

Kazuki: Oh, much better, thanks.

Date: Kazuki‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry I got you into this mess.

Kazuki: Not at all. You saved me, Date-san.

Date: That‚Äôs a bit much.

Kazuki: No, I mean it. You freed me from those mafia thugs.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Kazuki: They had me locked up for the past six months.

Date: Six months!?

Yuya: Wha!? Then who was the Kazuki-san at the club!?

Kazuki: Yeah, that wasn‚Äôt me. It was the other guy. I could hardly believe it myself. I never imagined someone could look so similar‚Ä¶ The other guy was a Korean‚Ä¶

Kiryu: One of the Jingweon, then?

Kazuki: Right. They jumped me outside the bar one night, and next thing I know, I‚Äôm a hostage.

Date: They were just using you to get to us‚Ä¶

Kazuki: Most likely. Kiryu-san, Date-san‚Ä¶ I overheard them say some horrible things‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Like?

Kazuki: I didn‚Äôt get everything, but‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre planning to destroy the city.

Date: What do you mean!?

Kazuki: There was more than one bomb. And the whole town‚Äôs already rigged to blow.

Date: What!?

Kazuki: They‚Äôve been working on this for years.

Kiryu: Where are the other bombs?

Kazuki: All I know is how many there are.

Date: How many?

Kazuki: One of them said‚Ä¶ "One bomb for each of the brothers we lost 26 years ago."

Date: Kiryu, the number of victims in that raid were‚Ä¶

Kiryu: It was 33.

Date: Then there are 33 bombs‚Ä¶ One went off in the Millennium Tower‚Ä¶ One we took care of along with Kurahashi‚Ä¶

Kiryu: That leaves 31.

Date: Kiryu, I‚Äôll call the station to have them prep for bomb disposal.

Yuya: Bomb disposal!?

Date: Yeah, the bomb squad. Even if we find them, only a technician can disarm them safely.

Kiryu: Got it.

[Kiryu and Date walk out of the room.]

Kiryu: Date-san, I‚Äôve got to go to Tojo Clan HQ.

Date: Why would you need to do that?

Kiryu: Tonight‚Ä¶ The Go-Ryu Clan is going to hit Kamurocho with everything they‚Äôve got.

Date: What? You‚Äôre sure?

Kiryu: Yes. And now more than ever, we need the Tojo Clan on our side. On the city‚Äôs side. The only way we save this town is if everyone does their part. Them too.

Date: Makes sense. Leave the bomb squad to me, then. ‚Ä¶I‚Äôll call you if anything comes up. Good luck.

Kiryu: Yeah.

[He takes a cab to Tojo HQ building.]

Yayoi: Thirty-one bombs!?

Kiryu: Yes, but we‚Äôre handling it. Date-san has the police mobilized to defuse the bombs. Our part in this is to protect the city from the Go-Ryu Clan invasion.

Yayoi: That‚Äôs fine in theory‚Ä¶ But most of our officers are down. All our men are out there with no one to form the ranks‚Ä¶.

Daigo: Kashiwagi-san, how many men could you pull together?

Kashiwagi: Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ Local to Kamurocho, we could manage maybe 300‚Ä¶

Daigo: Kashiwagi-san‚Ä¶ Will you trust me with those 300 men?

[Kashiwagi and Yayoi are shocked by his question.]

Kashiwagi: Yes. I‚Äôll go make some calls.

[He leaves the room.]

Yayoi: You‚Äôll take a stand for the Tojo Clan?

Daigo: Dad and Patriarch Kazama risked everything to keep this town safe. I‚Äôm not handing it over to Ryuji Goda now. The Go-Ryu Clan can‚Äôt have our city!

Kiryu: Daigo‚Ä¶

[Ryuji‚Äôs limo already driving Kanto‚Äôs roads‚Ä¶ Tojo‚Äôs yakuza prepare their weapons‚Ä¶ Daigo stands before them with his shirt off. There‚Äôs a generan with a katana on his back (just my guess).]

Daigo: All of you, listen up! Look‚Ä¶ This isn‚Äôt just a Tojo Clan problem anymore. This fight is for every yakuza in Kanto.

Tojo Yakuza: Yes, sir!

Daigo: We grew up in this town. Some might say I have no right saying it, but I love this city. So I want to give something back to my town! As proud members of the Tojo Clan‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs show those Go-Ryu assholes they aren‚Äôt welcome in Kamurocho!

Tojo Yakuza: Yes, sir!

Kiryu: Nobody could object to Daigo taking over the Tojo Clan after this. (someone calls him) It‚Äôs me. Got it. I‚Äôll head to Purgatory now.

Daigo: What is it?

Kiryu: That was Date. He says we‚Äôve got trouble.

[He and Daigo return to Kamurocho.]

Kiryu: Let‚Äôs head to Purgatory. Date-san‚Äôs waiting for us there.

Daigo: Yeah‚Ä¶ What do you think he wants? Something to do with the bombs?

Kiryu: I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ But we should hurry.

Daigo: Right.

[They go to the underground city of Purgatory.]

Kiryu: What‚Äôs going on?

Date: HQ is going to sit this one out.

Kiryu: What‚Ä¶?

The Florist: Date here is still a wanted man. I guess tips from murder suspects don‚Äôt have much cred. Besides, Kazuki‚Äôs word is all we‚Äôve got to go on that these 31 bombs even exist.

Date: The police won‚Äôt act without more solid proof. I knew that‚Äôd be a risk, but this is a new low‚Ä¶

Daigo: So you‚Äôre saying Kamurocho can‚Äôt be saved?

Kiryu: We‚Äôll just have to do it ourselves. Put your 300 men to work on the bombs.

Daigo: What about the Go-Ryu?

Kiryu: I‚Äôll handle them.

Daigo: Alone!?

Kiryu: Kamurocho‚Äôs a big place. It won‚Äôt be easy to find 31 bombs. But if anyone knows this city, it‚Äôs the Tojo Clan. They‚Äôll find them. Leave the Go-Ryu Clan to me.

Daigo: ‚Ä¶All right.

Date: Still, 31 of them‚Ä¶ If only we knew where to even look..

The Florist: That‚Äôd be a cinch if the system here was up.

[Nearby, a crazy chant is heard. Majima enters.]

Majima: Look at this mopey bunch‚Äôa sad sacks!

Kiryu: Majima-san‚Ä¶

Majima: Kiryu-chan! Sounds like we‚Äôre pretty fucked, eh!? Okay! Outta my damn way.

[He hits the Florist‚Äôs table with his head (at least he is wearing a helmet).]

Majima: What the‚Ä¶

[He hits the table again‚Ä¶]

Kiryu: I don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶

Majima: Ya said ya needed this system, didn‚Äôt ya!?

[He hits the table one more time‚Ä¶]

Majima: What is this shit!? What‚Äôs the goddamn problem!?

[He hits the table again and again‚Ä¶]

The Florist: Hey, you okay, man? ‚Ä¶Should we stop him?

Daigo: Uh, probably‚Ä¶

[Kiryu trying to stop Majima.]

Majima: Go, ya fuck! I said fuckin‚Äô go!

[With the last hit the platform on which the table stands starts to lower‚Ä¶ into the old Florist Hideout‚Ä¶]

Majima: Wooo! Nailed it!

Daigo: What the hell!?

Date: Wh-What is‚Ä¶
Majima: Thought it might come in handy someday, so I kept the dust off.

The Florist: Hey‚Ä¶ Not too shabby!

Majima: ‚ÄôCourse, I woulda been filthy rich with a get-up like this‚Ä¶

Kiryu: You just saved us, Majima-san!

Majima: Well, now it‚Äôs your turn. "Legendary" info-dealer-han.

The Florist:Yup, I‚Äôll have those bombs pinpointed in no time.

Kiryu: (to Daigo) The rest is up to you.

Daigo: Right.

[Kiryu leves the hideout and got a call.]

Kiryu: This is Kiryu.
Barkeep: Kiryu-san! It‚Äôs the bartender over at Bantam!

Kiryu: What‚Äôs wrong!?

Barkeep: S-Some men from the Omi Alliance just‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Are they Go-Ryu!?

Barkeep: Y-Yes! They want to find you, and they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ Ahh!

Kiryu: Are you okay!? Talk to me! Damn it!

[Kiryu rushes to Bantam. He got another call on the way.]

Emoto: Kiryu? This is Emoto.

Kiryu: What‚Äôs wrong? Are you okay?

Emoto: Some men claiming to be with the Go-Ryu Clan just busted into my clinic, and they‚Äôre hellbent on wrecking it. H-Hey! What are you doing!? S-Stop!

Kiryu: Doc‚Ä¶!? ‚Ä¶They can‚Äôt drag innocent civilians into this!

[Soon he gets another call!]

Kiryu: Hello?

Yuya: Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: Yuya?

Yuya: It‚Äôs the Go-Ryu Clan! They‚Äôre‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yuya!

Yuya: I-I‚Äôm okay. ‚Ä¶We‚Äôll do whatever we can here, Kiryu-san. You focus on stopping them!

Kiryu: All right. Do your best. I‚Äôll be there soon as I can!

[When Kiryu comes out of Purgatory, Tamura runs up to him.]

Tamura: Huff‚Ä¶ Huff‚Ä¶ Kiryu-san! It‚Äôs terrible!

Kiryu: What‚Äôs wrong?

Tamura: The Go-Ryu Clan are raising hell all over town‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs like an invasion! Nobody can stop them!

Kiryu: Yeah, I just got a call from the bartender down at Bantam. He said the Go-Ryu hit him too.

Tamura: If you don‚Äôt hurry, there won‚Äôt be a town to save!

Kiryu: I know.

[He rushes to Bantam.]

Go-Ryu Member: Finally decided to show up, Kazuma Kiryu? Almost gave up on waitin‚Äô for ya! But now that you‚Äôre here‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs time to die!

[Kiryu kicks their asses though it was not that easy.]

Kiryu: (The Go-Ryu are taking no prisoners‚Ä¶ I have to stop them!) Barkeep, you all right?

Barkeep: Yes, somehow.. Kiryu-san, thank you so much! You best take care of yourself, you hear?

[Next, Kiryu runs to Emoto Clinic.]

Go-Ryu Member: Hey, thanks for comin‚Äô to us, man! Must mean you‚Äôre ready to accept what comes next!

[Kiryu quickly deals with the young yakuzas.]

Kiryu: (I‚Äôm worried about Yuya, but hopefully he can hold his own a little longer. I‚Äôve gotta make sure Yuya and Stardust are okay.) Hey, you okay?

Emoto: Yeah, thanks for the help. They‚Äôre still everywhere, though. You better be careful out there.

[Kiryu runs to Stardust. When he walks into the club several yakuza are kicking Kazuki on the floor and punches Yuya.]

Kiryu: Yuya! He had nothing to do with any of this! You came for me, didn‚Äôt you!?

Ryuji: Sure did. Figured if we waited here, you‚Äôd show up eventually. Took yer sweet time, though, huh?

Kiryu: Ryuji‚Ä¶!

Ryuji: Oh, if looks could kill! Wouldn‚Äôt be much fun if ya didn‚Äôt take this seriously. Good shit! Go nuts, boys!

[Kiryu shows the Go-Ryu Clan how brutal he can be. However‚Ä¶ The many contractions in a row had exhausted him. Kiryu breathes heavily looking at Ryuji standing on the second floor.Ryuji draws his katana from its sheath and descends to the first floor. Kiryu drops to the knee.]

Yuya: Kiryu-san!

[Ryuji swings to kill Kiryu, but his hand stops at the last moment.]

Kiryu: What‚Äôs your game here?

Ryuji:If I take ya out like this‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt become the real dragon. ‚ÄôSides‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got some unfinished business, don‚Äôt ya?

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Ryuji:The bombs, buddy.

Kiryu: You‚Äôre saying you didn‚Äôt put them up to it?

Ryuji:That one‚Äôs a Jingweon special. Wasn‚Äôt my idea. I got nothin‚Äô to gain from this city burnin‚Äô down.

Kiryu: What‚Äôs that supposed to mean?

Ryuji: Kamurocho‚Äôs gonna be mine soon. I want it lookin‚Äô pretty for me. Who needs ashes?

Kiryu: Ryuji‚Ä¶

Ryuji: When you‚Äôre done, come on up to me. I ain‚Äôt gonna run or hide from this. I‚Äôll wait for ya at the town‚Äôs highest point.

Kiryu: Fine.

Ryuji: No interruptions this time. Just you n‚Äô me.

Kiryu: Right.

[Ryuji slowly walks away.]

Chapter 15: BLOOD AND BONDS
[Kiryu brings a glass of water to Yuya.]

Kiryu: Hey. Feeling a little better now?

Yuya: Yeah‚Ä¶

Kiryu: You held your own against the Go-Ryu Clan.

Yuya: Nah‚Ä¶ Me n‚Äô Kazuki-san both owe this town for everything we‚Äôve got today. So I can‚Äôt stand it when someone tries to muscle their way in. Not that I could do a damn thing to stop them‚Ä¶

Yuya: That‚Äôs not true at all. You risked your life to protect this place.

Yuya: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ You guys are here working your butts off every night. It‚Äôs impressive. People like you keep Kamurocho going. Compared to you, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm only of any use in times like these. Can you make it to the hospital?

Yuya: Yes.

[Daigo enters.]

Kiryu: Daigo?

Daigo: The Go-Ryu Clan did this?

Kiryu: Yeah.. I took care of them all, though.

Daigo: What about Ryuji Goda? Did you kill him?

Kiryu: No‚Ä¶ I still have to settle things with him.

Daigo: I see‚Ä¶

Kiryu: How are those bombs coming?

Daigo: We‚Äôve taken out 30 so far. Majima‚Äôs working on the last one as we speak.

Kiryu: Wait, Majima-san!?

[Meanwhile Majima and his subordinate tries to defuse the bomb without knowledge‚Ä¶ proper tools‚Ä¶ protection‚Ä¶ and brains. There‚Äôs about 100 minutes left.]

Majima: The red one!

Subordinate: Yes, sir!

Majima: Neeeext‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs go blue!

Subordinate: Y-Yes, sir!

Majima: What‚Äôs up? Ya got gas or somethin‚Äô?

Subordinate: N-No sir‚Ä¶ I was just thinking about my mother, back in the country.

Majima: What‚Äôs yer momma got to do with this bomb!?

Subordinate: No, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ She lives by herself, so if something were to happen to me‚Ä¶

Majima: That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre stoppin‚Äô it, numbnuts!

Subordinate: B-But, boss‚Ä¶ Does doing this really tell you how the wiring works?

Majima: You for real!? How the fuck should I know how this tangly-ass rainbow shit works!? But we gotta handle it, so I‚Äôm here, puttin‚Äô my instincts to work.

Subordinate: Instincts!? This is all instinct!?

Majima: What‚Äôs that? Ya don‚Äôt trust my instincts?

Subordinate: N-No‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not that, sir!

Majima: Then let‚Äôs get back to work!

Subordinate: Yes, sir! There‚Äôs only two left.

Majima: Yeah? Aww, fuck this! Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, oh-god-which-one-isn‚Äôt-gonna-blow? This one. Gimme red!

Subordinate: Boss! This is a life-or-death decision here! Can we take it a little more seriously!?

Majima: Shut it, nitwit! I said gimme red! Gimme those!

[He cuts the red cable himself and‚Ä¶ everything explodes. Kaoru wakes up sitting on a computer in Osaka.]

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶What an awful dream.

[She cracks the CD.]

Kaoru: Nice. Huh? Holy shit.

[Back to Kiryu.]

Kiryu: You really left Majima-san in charge of defusing a bomb?

Daigo: Yeah? He‚Äôs taking care of the last one as we speak.

Kiryu: You don‚Äôt know him like‚Äî Never mind. We‚Äôve just got to trust him. I‚Äôm going back to Purgatory in the meantime.

Daigo: Got it.

[Kiryu takes a cab to Purgatory and finds Majma sitting on a crate. His subordinate massages his shoulders.]

Kiryu: Why‚Äôd I even worry, Majima-san?

Majima: Man, I‚Äôm on fire today! My instincts are the real deal, yeah

Subordinate: Y-Yes, sir!

Kiryu: (bows) Thank you.

Majima: Enough of that! Not like any of this was hard. It was half for shits n‚Äô giggles anyway. Well, I‚Äôm famished. Work makes me so damn hungry, y‚Äôknow?

Subordinate: Yes, sir!

Majima: So Kiryu-chan, the rest is up to you. Later. Oh, and Kiryu-chan‚Ä¶ (seriously) Lose to that Ryuji clown, and I‚Äôll straight up ruin ya. I still want another showdown.

Kiryu: All right.

Date: I can‚Äôt stop you from taking on Ryuji, can I?

Kiryu: Sayama‚Äôs coming back tonight. After that, I‚Äôm going after him alone. So while we wait‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna go enjoy the city with Haruka.

Date: Kiryu, I‚Äôve got something to tell you. Can you meet me at Serena later?

Kiryu: Sure, but can‚Äôt you just tell me now?

Date: Sorry, but this isn‚Äôt the time or the place. And I‚Äôm a little busy right now myself.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Date: I‚Äôll give you a call when I‚Äôm done. Why don‚Äôt you take Haruka out for a bit in the meantime? Poor girl has been on pins and needles waiting for you.

Kiryu: Yeah, you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶

Date: I talk to you soon.

[Kiryu and Haruka have a good time shopping and eating and playing. Time flies. Kiryu got a call from Date.]

Kiryu: This is Kiryu.

Date: It‚Äôs me. I just finished up my preparations. Can you swing by Serena when you get a chance? There‚Äôs something I need to say before Sayama gets back into town.

Kiryu: All right.

[Kiryu and Haruka go back to Serena.]

Kiryu: You‚Äôre with Division One‚Ä¶

Sudo: (bows) It‚Äôs been a while.

Kiryu: What brings you out here?

Sudo: Yes, well‚Ä¶

Date: Haruka‚Ä¶ We need to talk with Kiryu real quick. Can you wait outside for a sec?

Haruka: Okay, sure.

[She goes outside.]

Date: You need to see this. I made a copy of Kurahashi‚Äôs disc and had Sudo analyze it too.

Kiryu: These are‚Ä¶

Date: Sayama and Ryuji Goda‚Äôs records. Note the name listed under Ryuji‚Äôs parents.

Kiryu: Suyeon Jung‚Ä¶ No way‚Ä¶

Date: Kaoru Sayama and Ryuji Goda share the same mother.

Kiryu: Which means‚Ä¶

[Kaoru suddenly enters.]

Kaoru: I made it back. What is it? Why‚Äôs everyone look like death?

Kiryu: Nothing‚Ä¶

Date: You haven‚Äôt met, have you? This is Superintendent Sudo, Chief of Tokyo‚Äôs Division Four.

Sudo: Nice to meet you.

Kaoru: Nice to meet you. Assistant Inspector Kaoru Sayama, Osaka Division Four.

Sudo: Well, I need to get back to work. Excuse me.

Date: Sure.

[Sudo takes the documents and leaves.]

Kaoru: Why was the Division Four chief here?

Date: He came by to ask me about the bomb scare.

Kaoru: What happened with the bombs?

Kiryu: We dismantled all of them.

Kaoru: Oh‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs great news.

Date: What about that disk from Kurahashi?

Kaoru: Not even the system at HQ could crack it.

Date: I see‚Ä¶

[Date and Kiryu quickly notice that she‚Äôs lying.]

Kaoru: And the Go-Ryu Clan?

Kiryu: I managed to beat them back. All that‚Äôs left is Ryuji.

Kaoru: Just him?

Kiryu: That‚Äôs right. He wants to settle things with me, so he pulled back.

Kaoru: Where is he?

Kiryu: The highest point in Kamurocho‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs where he‚Äôs waiting for me.

Date: Kamurocho Hills, I guess?

Kiryu: Most likely.

Kaoru: And you‚Äôre going?

Kiryu: Yeah. I don‚Äôt see any way around this fight.

Kaoru: I forbid it.

Kiryu: What?

Kaoru: I‚Äôm Division Four‚Äôs lead detective here. I can‚Äôt turn a blind eye to a man saying he plans to fight someone to the death.

Date: How can you say that now!?

Kaoru: Because I‚Äôm saying it as an officer of the law!

Kiryu: I see‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm still going. I wouldn‚Äôt make presumptions.

Kaoru: You‚Äôre still in my custody. I can arrest you any time.

Kiryu: Then do it.

Kaoru: You‚Äôre going anyway?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Kaoru: Fine. Then there‚Äôs somewhere I want you to go first.

Kiryu: Where?

Kaoru: My chief‚Äôs in town at Tokyo PD. He has something to tell you.

Kiryu: What? Bessho-san‚Äôs here?

Kaoru: Yeah. The Omi‚Äôs Takashima Family is acting odd. That‚Äôs probably it. So? Will you meet with him?

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs fine.

Kaoru: Alright, head to Tokyo PD.

Kiryu: Police headquarters?

Kaoru: Yeah, the chief said he‚Äôd be waiting in Archive Room 13 on the 3rd floor basement.

Date: What the hell?

Kaoru: You know the place, Date-san?

Date: I guess you could say that.

Kiryu: All right. Archive Room 13, right?

Kaoru: Yep‚Ä¶ Thanks.

Date: If you‚Äôre heading to Tokyo PD, nl go with you. I know the place, and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ probably better that way.

Kiryu: Yeah, thanks.

[They go to Tokyo PD.]

Date: Sayama was acting funny, don‚Äôt you think?

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶

Date: Think something happened in Kansai? Kinda strange that Osaka‚Äôs Division Four chief would ask us down here too. Hm? There‚Äôs nobody here‚Ä¶ Wait, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶

[He finds a computer‚Ä¶ notebook actually.]

Kiryu: What is it?

[Date brings the computer out of standby mode and sees Kaoru on the screen.]

Date: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Sayama!?

Kaoru: (on video) There, that looks good. Umm, hi. Sorry for the wild goose chase. I‚Äôm recording this now just in case anything happens to me. I wanted to tell you everything I know and how I feel about it. So please‚Ä¶ Just hear me out. I finally cracked Kurahashi‚Äôs disk using Osaka PD‚Äôs system. I learned a lot from it. Ryuji Goda and I are‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre half-siblings by blood. I think Kawara-san‚Ä¶ Er, my dad, rescued a young Ryuji Goda from the fire that night. To think, now my only living family member is Ryuji Goda‚Ä¶ Talk about ironic, eh? I grew up hating organized crime, and my brother‚Äôs a yakuza. Anyway, all I can do now is talk to him. Try to get him to stop this stupid war. As his only blood relative‚Ä¶ And as a Division Four detective. Everything we talked about‚Ä¶ The time we spent in Osaka‚Ä¶ I know I‚Äôll never forget it. I‚Äôll keep it in my heart, always. It‚Äôll be my one and only memory of you‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm fine with that. We‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ The worlds we live in are so different. I never should‚Äôve let you in like I did. Just goes to show‚Ä¶ how special you are. (cries) Sorry‚Ä¶ I meant to say goodbye with a smile! I‚Äôm keeping that promise, though. I‚Äôm done running from my fate. ‚Ä¶Goodbye.

Date: Sayama‚Ä¶

[Kiryu brutally hits the table and walks briskly toward the exit. He is consumed by a ferocious rage.]

Chapter 16: DECISION
[We‚Äôre back at Serena. Date and Kiryu talking about what to do next.]

Date: I think we both know where Sayama went‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yeah, Kamurocho Hills.

Date: ‚Ä¶You‚Äôre going, aren‚Äôt you?

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs time to put an end to this.

Date: You‚Äôre right. Once Ryui Goda is taken care of, the fighting stops. But that means he‚Äôs got nothing to lose. He‚Äôll fight you with everything he‚Äôs got. You better be ready for that. But that means he‚Äôs got nothing to lose. Hell fight you with everything he‚Äôs got. You better be ready for that.

Kiryu: I know.

Date: Come see me before you go. And take your time getting ready.

[Kiryu prepares for the brutal final battle‚Ä¶ by eating a burger at the nearest diner.]

Date: Kiryu‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no turning back after this. You‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre ready?

Kiryu: Yeah, I‚Äôm ready.

Date: Okay. I‚Äôll watch Haruka for you. Don‚Äôt worry about her.

Kiryu: Thanks, Date-san. I know she‚Äôs in good hands.

[He leaves Serena. Some Jingweon mafioso greets him right away.]

Jingweon Mafioso: [Hey, it‚Äôs Kiryu! C‚Äômon, this way!]

Kiryu: (rushes at them) Let‚Äôs go!

Jingweon Mafioso: [Die!]

[Kiryu rushes through Kamurocho punching the shit out of Korean mafiosos. He climbs to the top of Kamurocho Hills, which is under construction, where he finds Kaoru holding a gun on Ryuji.]

Kiryu: Kaoru!

Kaoru: Kazuma‚Ä¶

Ryuji: Ya wanna fill me in on this, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Ryuji‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Don‚Äôt move! Hand over Chairman Goda!

Ryuji: He‚Äôs over there‚Ä¶ Knock yerself out.

[Kiryu runs to the old man.]

Kiryu: Chairman!

[He unties him.]

Kiryu: He‚Äôs okay!

Ryuji: So? What bring ya up here, lady?

Kaoru: You do. I came to arrest you.

Ryuji: (smirks) Little late, ain‚Äôt ya? You‚Äôre in knee-deep with the Tojo Clan. Hardly an angel yourself, eh?

Kaoru: I agree. I‚Äôll be turning myself in alongside ya. I‚Äôll be joining you, in jail or wherever.

Ryuji: The hell?

Kaoru: I‚Äôm done watchin‚Äô my family die.

Ryuji: Yer family? Ya got a screw loose, lady?

Kaoru: Ryuji Goda‚Ä¶ You remember it, don‚Äôt you? Bein‚Äô rescued from a burning building.

Ryuji: So what if I do!?

Kaoru: Don‚Äôt ya know what that means? You‚Äôre one of the Jingweon Mafia survivors.

Ryuji: And what the fuck of it!?

Kaoru: Ya wouldn‚Äôt know this, but Suyeon Jung‚Ä¶ Your mother was still alive. She took a new name. Shoko Kawara. My mother. You and I‚Ä¶ We share Suyeon‚Äôs blood, making us brother and sister!

Ryuji: Wha‚Ä¶ What the fuck is this!?

Kaoru: I came here to help you. As your sister. And‚Ä¶ as a cop. So please, stop this fighting! Ryuji Goda-san‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre under arrest.

Ryuji: Bullshit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve got‚Ä¶ a little sister?

Jin Goda: The lady‚Äôs tellin‚Äô the truth. I‚Äôm sorry I never told you, Ryuji‚Ä¶ I just couldn‚Äôt. 26 years ago, Suyeon came to Kansai, and we got acquainted. It was at a little bar in Sotenbori. It was pure luck I met her there. Heard her story‚Ä¶ The mafia was gettin‚Äô closer every day‚Ä¶ And she was exhausted tryin‚Äô to keep her baby safe. I was livin‚Äô comfortable enough. I offered to help, hopin‚Äô to make her life easier. After that, I took her in. But then‚Ä¶ This cop named Kawara transferred down to Kansai, lookin‚Äô for her. He took Suyeon away from me‚Ä¶

Kaoru: My father, you mean.

Jin Goda: That‚Äôs right. Not that I blamed her. In the end, I‚Äôm still a yakuza. I knew Suyeon was only with me to survive.

Ryuji: So you‚Äôre sayin‚Äô‚Ä¶ My own mama threw me away.

Jin Goda: No! It was at my request. As Suyeon left, I begged her to leave you. You were a real son to me. More.

Ryuji: Shut up! Why the fuck should I care now!?

Jin Goda: Ryuji‚Ä¶

Ryuji: All my life, I‚Äôve been alone‚Ä¶ Thinkin‚Äô of nothing but surpassin‚Äô the renowned yakuza, Jin Goda. I went so far as workin‚Äô with those Jingweon fucks to make this war happen.

Jin Goda: You‚Ä¶ do still remember that night, then.

Ryuji: What‚Äôs it matter? I don‚Äôt give a shit about revenge or their stupid grudge. Our goals aligned. That‚Äôs all. And now‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre the only thing left!

[Kiryu walks in.]

Kaoru: Hold it! I‚Äôm not done talkin‚Äô here!

Kiryu: Ryuji Goda‚Ä¶ I have you pegged. You‚Äôre exactly the man I thought you were. Whatchya mean by that?

Kiryu: You can‚Äôt change the way you live. Your instincts drive you, and you act on them.

Ryuji: Heh. You don‚Äôt know me.

Kiryu: You remind me of an old friend‚Ä¶ He chose to fight to give meaning to his life. A man like that deserves everything I‚Äôve got.

[He pushes the button locking himself and Ryuji in the freight elevator.]

Kaoru: Kazuma!

Kiryu: Kaoru‚Ä¶ Sorry.

Ryuji: It‚Äôs set! On the field of battle, the yakuza flower‚Ä¶ Now in full bloom!

[He takes off his shirt revealing his dragon. Kiryu does the same.]

Ryuji: (unsheaths his katana) Ya better be ready‚Ä¶

[And IT‚ÄôS ON! KAZUMA KIRYU VS GO-RYU CLAN PATRIARCH, RYUJI GODA!! Not without effort, Kiryu manages to defeat the pumped-up Ryuji. Exhausted, he falls to the floor. Jin Goda arrives at the scene of the fight in his wheelchair.]

Kiryu: Chairman‚Ä¶ (bows) I‚Äôm sorry.

Jin Goda: No‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs better this way. Thanks to you, I finally got to hear how Ryuji truly feels. Honestly‚Ä¶ Thank you very much.

Kiryu: Chairman Goda‚Ä¶

Jin Goda: I hid the only things that really mattered to Ryuji‚Ä¶ I feared he would up n‚Äô leave me if he ever learned the truth. Sayama-san‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Yes?

Jin Goda: As Ryuji‚Äôs father, it falls on me to take responsibility for the crimes of my son.

Kaoru: Chairman‚Ä¶

Jin Goda: I‚Äôve carried the Omi sigil this far‚Ä¶ I wanna end things the right way. Take me in alongside Ryuji.

Familiar Voice: Well done‚Ä¶ Chairman Goda, Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs impressive how faithfully you‚Äôve followed my script.

Kiryu: No way‚Ä¶ I know that voice‚Ä¶ Terada‚Ä¶!

Jin Goda: What‚Äôs the meaning of this!?

Terada: This is the tapestry I set out to paint‚Ä¶ And it took me 26 years to see it realized.

Kaoru: That means, you‚Äôre‚Ä¶!

Terada: Exactly. I am Daejin Kim. The final survivor of the raid 26 years ago.

Kiryu: Still‚Ä¶ Why would you fake your own death?

Terada: You are not a man moved by reason. Dying was the only sure way to bait you into action.

Kiryu: Why go that far for me?

Terada: If you moved, the Omi would respond in kind. The stage was set for a war between Kanto and Kansai. So goes the first act‚Ä¶

Kiryu: That means‚Ä¶ you fed me that line about the oath to put Ryuji in play?

Terada: Yes‚Ä¶ Ryuji would never allow the Omi Alliance to ally with the Tojo Clan. Naturally he staged a coup d‚Äô√©tat, then set his sights on Kanto. ‚Ä¶Only to be defeated by you. Also part of the plan, I might add.

Kiryu: So Ryuji was one of your targets too?

Terada: Right again. He turned his back on our creed‚Ä¶ So of course. He refused to rejoin his Jingweon brethren. He didn‚Äôt care about the grudge left to fester for 26 years. All he cared about was the view from the top. So I used that knowledge to make him uphold our creed and die for our cause.

Kiryu: Terada‚Ä¶!

Terada: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ Once you‚Äôre out of the picture‚Ä¶ The Tojo Clan will crumble, and it will all be over.

[He gives the sign and some Jingweon mafiosos approaches. Even the traitor is among them.]

Terada: (smokes a cigarette) It‚Äôs taken ages‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs done. I lived for 26 years as Yukio Terada. But that, too, is almost over‚Ä¶ Once you‚Äôre dead, I‚Äôll end it with the switch for the explosives.

Kiryu: Explosives!?

Terada: (smirks) You hadn‚Äôt noticed? It‚Äôs been right in front of your noses.

Kaoru: But how!?

Kiryu: All the bombs were disarmed!

Terada: This one is for Kurahashi. The man killed by your father, Jiro Kawara. You took the life of a comrade‚Ä¶ A friend. So I‚Äôve prepared this to make you answer for that. I press this button, and Kamurocho drowns in a sea of flames.

Kaoru: Are you insane!?

Terada: Oh, don‚Äôt worry. By the time this goes off, you won‚Äôt be around to care.

Kiryu: Terada‚Ä¶

Terada: What is it?

Kiryu: Just answer this. Those words you said‚Ä¶ In front of Kazama-san‚Äôs grave. Was that all a lie?

Terada: What does it matter?

Kiryu: 26 years ago‚Ä¶ The man who saved you‚Ä¶ Was it not Kazama-san!?

Terada: What!? How could you know‚Ä¶?

Kiryu: I was there 26 years ago‚Ä¶ And I saw you.

[We plunge into that fateful night again. Terada and Kurahashi with some other Jingweon members hiding behind a desk.]

Young Terada: [Yeongmin, what do we do!?]

Young Kurohashi: [Shit! We‚Äôre no match for them‚Ä¶]

[Unable to contain the tension, one of the members of the mafia runs out of hiding.]

Young Terada: [Ko..!]

[Shimano kills him and leaves.]

Young Terada: [All right‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs move. We‚Äôll go down fighting, for Ko!]

Young Kurohashi: [If we can get him from behind‚Ä¶]

[But Kazama finds them in a second. Terada and Kurohashi tremble in fear. Kazama lowers his guns.]

Kazama: Live.

Young Terada: Huh?

Kazama: You boys are still young. Don‚Äôt waste your lives. Live.

[Young Kiryu witnesses this. They meet Young Terada‚Äôs glance. We‚Äôre back to the present.]

Terada: I see‚Ä¶ So you were the boy. It‚Äôs true. Yeongmin and I lived through the night ‚Äôcause of Kazama-san.

Kiryu: Terada‚Ä¶

Terada: Even so, I struck at Kazama-san to avenge my fallen brothers. Again and again‚Ä¶ Yet he still looked after me. To the point of leading me to the Omi.

Jin Goda: I see‚Ä¶ That explains why. After you swore to the Omi‚Ä¶ A Dojima man named Kazama came to ask me to watch over you. He begged me on his hands and knees‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Terada‚Ä¶ Kazama-san did all of that and more for you. Don‚Äôt you have any shred of humanity?

Terada: Kiryu-san, I fear ya don‚Äôt get it yet. I‚Äôm a member of the Jingweon Mafia. The creed takes precedence over all else‚Ä¶ (squeezes his cigarette in a fist) Even if it means killing our own parents. Such is our fate.

Kiryu: Those aren‚Äôt the words of a human‚Ä¶

Terada: Right. Our organization has forsaken humanity. How else could we possibly live for 26 years for the sole purpose of revenge? In any case, you‚Äôre just an obstacle now! Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre going to die! Let‚Äôs put an end to this.

[He reloads an UZI. Terada or Haejin Kim as he‚Äôs known to us now, attack Kiryu with a bunch of his men. The battle turns out to be fierce, with truth and victory on Kiryu‚Äôs side.]

Terada: Kiryu‚Ä¶ This isn‚Äôt over‚Ä¶! (falls on the floor)

Kiryu: No, this is where your "script" ends.

[However‚Ä¶ Someone is shooting at Kiryu‚Ä¶ in the same place he was just recently stabbed‚Ä¶]

Kaoru: Kazuma!

Terada: You‚Äôre late‚Ä¶

Jin Goda: Takashima!

Takashima: I really must thank you. You‚Äôve cleared people out of my way, one after the next.

[Kaoru wants to help Kiryu‚Ä¶]

Kiryu: Stay back!

Takashima: Please don‚Äôt move. You‚Äôve done well. Leave the rest to me.

Jin Goda: So you were behind all this!?

[Takashima shots the old man in the shoulder and shots the gun out of Kaoru‚Äôs hand.]

Kiryu: K-Kaoru!

Takashima: You‚Äôre correct, Chairman. Terada authored this script according to my vision.

Jin Goda: ‚Ä¶You‚Äôd betray the Omi Alliance? To sell us to the Jingweon!?

Takashima: Betrayal? Are you really that dense?

Terada: Takashima‚Äôs goals mirrored the Jingweon‚Äôs. We both wanted to crush the Tojo Clan.

Takashima: Exactly. And that‚Äôs all but accomplished now. Therefore‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre no longer necessary.

[He shots Terada in the heart.]

Kiryu: Terada!

Takashima: (laughs) He never saw I was playing him all along! What a fool!

Terada: I knew it‚Ä¶ you snake‚Ä¶

Jin Goda: Takashima, you‚Äî

[Takashima shots Jin Goda in the second shoulder.]

Jin Goda: T-Takashima‚Ä¶ What of the Omi‚Ä¶? What‚Ä¶ will you do?

Takashima: Oh, rest assured. I‚Äôll pick it up where you left off.

Jin Goda: I‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Allow it!

[Takashima shot him the third time. Right in the heart.]

Takashima: I‚Äôll tell you before you go‚Ä¶ I plan to become the sixth chairman of the Omi Alliance and absorb the Tojo Clan. I will rule over our nation‚Äôs yakuza. Then I‚Äôll use the Jingweon Mafia to spread to the mainland. That‚Äôs how the script really ends.

Jin Goda: Y-You..

[He spits some blood and dies.]

Kiryu: Goda-san‚Ä¶!

Takashima: (laughs) All of your stupidity knows no bounds! Why do you trust people like this!? It‚Äôs ludicrous!

Terada: I-I never did‚Ä¶ In my heart‚Ä¶ I knew‚Ä¶ something was off about you.

Takashima: What, you‚Äôre still alive? Your role is done.

Terada: Your plan‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt end‚Ä¶ how you think‚Ä¶. Soon‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll see‚Ä¶!

Takashima: You people talk too much.

[He shots Terada a couple of times.]

Terada: Kiryu-san‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just you‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ This bastard‚Ä¶ Stop him‚Ä¶ (pushes the button)

Kiryu: Terada‚Ä¶!

Terada: I-In the end‚Ä¶ Trust me‚Ä¶

[He dies.]

Takashima: What!?

[A bomb opens its shell. The timer says 10 minutes.]

Takashima: Shit! What have you done, you idiot!?

[He stuffs Terada‚Äôs dead body with bullets. Stupid Kaoru pulls out a folding baton and runs at Takashima screaming. He has no problem taking her hostage. Kiryu grabs a gun.]

Takashima: Move an inch, and I won‚Äôt hesitate to shoot‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Forget about me! Shoot!

Kiryu: Kaoru‚Ä¶!

Kaoru: Kazuma, you gotta shoot him! Just shoot, please!

Takashima: Kazuma Kiryu‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt do it. You can‚Äôt bear to make sacrifices. That‚Äôs what makes you weak.

[He shots Kiryu in the shoulder.]

Kaoru: Kazuma!

Takashima: Goddamn fool‚Ä¶ (to Kaoru) And now it‚Äôs your turn‚Ä¶ Die.

[But‚Ä¶ Ryuji wakes up and shoots Takashima.]

Kiryu: Ryuji‚Ä¶!

[Ryuji fires a full clip at Takashima. Takashima also manages to shoot several times, but Ryuji doesn‚Äôt pay much attention to it. Takashima falls near the bomb.]

Takashima: To think I let‚Ä¶ an idiot like you‚Ä¶ Get the better‚Ä¶ of me‚Ä¶

Ryuji: A real man‚Ä¶ oughta be a little stupid. Schemin‚Äô fuck like you‚Ä¶ Could never stand on top‚Ä¶

[He finishes Takashima off with a shot in his head.]

Ryuji: (panting like a beast) Ain‚Äôt room for‚Ä¶ more than one dragon.

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre right.

Kiryu: Wait! What are you doin‚Äô!? That bomb is ticking! We got five minutes ‚Äôtil it blows!

Ryuji: Damn‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fadin‚Äô out here. Gotta hurry‚Ä¶ and settle this.

Kaoru: We need to get outta here! Stop it! We‚Äôve gotta go!

Kiryu: I‚Äôm not going.

Kaoru: What!?

[He closes the doors of the freight elevator again.]

Kiryu: You better go. Live your life. I still have something to do.

Ryuji: This guy. I‚Äôm seein‚Äô now‚Ä¶ For real‚Ä¶ How my sister fell for ya. He‚Äôs right, though. Get outta here, fast.

Kaoru: Wh-What are you saying!? I can‚Äôt watch any more family die! I can‚Äôt watch the man I love die!

Kiryu: I know.

Kaoru: Then c‚Äômon, let‚Äôs‚Äî

Ryuji: Shut up, goddammit! Hey‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre fallin‚Äô apart here. It don‚Äôt even matter. We got‚Ä¶ no time left.

Kaoru: (crying) B-But‚Ä¶!

Ryuji: (to Kaoru) It‚Äôs a once-in-a-lifetime request‚Ä¶ Can ya do your brother‚Ä¶ this one favor?

[Kaoru bursts into tears. Ryuji takes her down the elevator.]

Ryuji: Alright‚Ä¶ The clock‚Äôs tickin‚Äô. Ya ready? Let‚Äôs go.

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt hold back. C‚Äômon!

[THE FINAL BATTLE!! FOR REAL THIS TIME!! RYUJI VS KIRYU!! After the fight Kaoru rushes in. She takes the stairs!]

Kaoru: Why‚Ä¶

Ryuji: (to Kaoru) Ya‚Ä¶ smell nice. Same as‚Ä¶ Mom did. Do ya‚Ä¶ remember her at all?

Kaoru: ‚Ä¶Nope.

Ryuji: Ya don‚Äôt? Sorry to hear it. Lost her before ya were‚Ä¶ old enough to even remember.

Kaoru: What was‚Ä¶ What was she like?

Ryuji: You look‚Ä¶ a lot like her. First time I laid eyes on ya‚Ä¶ I thought o‚Äô her. I got an‚Ä¶ adorable li‚Äôl sister here. If only‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd‚Ä¶ known.

Kaoru: Maybe we coulda avoided all this, huh?

Ryuji: Nah‚Ä¶ Got too much Jingweon blood in me‚Ä¶ Death woulda found me one way or another‚Ä¶. Not bad‚Ä¶ Made it further in I thought. Hey‚Ä¶ Gimme a smile. Mom‚Äôs face‚Ä¶ when she laughed‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶was great.

Kaoru: (smiles) Brother‚Ä¶

Ryuji: (laughs) There‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that smile.

[Ryuji dies. Kaoru bursts into tears. There‚Äôs 3 minutes and 25 seconds left on the timer. A helicopter flies in.]

Sudo: There‚Äôs not much time!

Date: (via loudspeaker) Kiryu, can you hear me!? It‚Äôs gonna blow! Get out of there!

Haruka: Uncle Kaz!

[But‚Ä¶ Kiryu falls on the floor. He lost too much blood.]

Kaoru: Kazuma‚Ä¶! We‚Äôve gotta get outta here, now!

Kiryu: You go‚Ä¶ Run‚Ä¶

Kaoru: What are you saying!?

Kiryu: I can barely‚Ä¶ move‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Don‚Äôt you give up! I‚Äôll carry you if I have to!

Kiryu: You need to save yourself!

Kaoru: Fine then. I‚Äôm stayin‚Äô here with you.

Kiryu: What?

Kaoru: I‚Äôm not gonna just leave you!

Kiryu: Forget about me‚Ä¶

Kaoru: I won‚Äôt do that!

Kiryu: Hurry‚Ä¶ Hurry‚Ä¶! Get out!

Kaoru: Then c‚Äômon, let‚Äôs‚Äî

Ryuji: Shut up, goddammit! Hey‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre fallin‚Äô apart here. It don‚Äôt even matter. We got‚Ä¶ no time left.

Kaoru: (crying) B-But‚Ä¶!

Kiryu: Hurry‚Ä¶ Hurry‚Ä¶! Get out!

Kaoru: Shut up! I said I‚Äôm staying with you!

Kiryu: Kaoru‚Ä¶

[They kiss. Two minutes after‚Ä¶ (and I‚Äôm not even joking, they show us the timer).]

Date: (via loudspeaker) Kiryu, can you hear me!? Get out of there!!

Sudo: Date-san, it‚Äôs too dangerous to get closer! There‚Äôs no time! ‚Ä¶We‚Äôve got to pull back!

Date: Kiryu‚Ä¶

Haruka: Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Less than a minute left‚Ä¶

Kaoru: Poor Haruka-chan‚Ä¶ We let her down.

Kiryu: We really did. But at least I know she‚Äôll understand.

Kaoru: You‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs a smart girl.

Kiryu: Are you scared?

Kaoru: Yeah‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôve never felt so warm before.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Kaoru: Thank you.

[The clock ticking‚Ä¶ every second is like a minute‚Ä¶ CREDITS.]

[After 10 minutes of waiting we see Haruka preying in the cemetery just like in the beginning of the game.]

Haruka: Thank you. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ never forget you.

[On the gravestone we see the name‚Ä¶ ÂØ∫Áî∞Ë°åÈõÑ (Yukio Terada).]

Haruka: Terada-san‚Ä¶ Thank you so much.

[Kiryu and Date standing nearby.]

Date: The whole time, the bomb was a fake‚Ä¶ I guess Terada wins best actor after all.

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ He wasn‚Äôt lying when he said he could never have trusted Takashima‚Ä¶

Date: I guess not.

[He pulls out a fuse that fell out of the dying Terada‚Äôs pocket.]

Date: He didn‚Äôt have the fuse in there to begin with. He never intended for the thing to go off. Still, gives me the shivers to even think about that bomb blowing‚Ä¶

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶ If Terada hadn‚Äôt done that though, Takashima would have gotten his way.

Date: Wait‚Ä¶ Did you know the bomb wouldn‚Äôt go off the whole time?

Kiryu: No‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt. But the last thing he said was, "Trust me."

Date: Trust him about what, though, I wonder?

Kiryu: If I had to guess‚Ä¶ About the way he felt toward Kazama-san. Now that I think about it.

Date: ‚Ä¶Makes enough sense. So in a way, he wasn‚Äôt lying.

Kiryu: Yeah‚Ä¶

[Someone approaches them.]

Haruka: Ah‚Ä¶!

[It‚Äôs Kaoru. She brings some flowers to honor the dead.]
