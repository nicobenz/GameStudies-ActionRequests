This game series puts a very strong emphasis on the story. If you haven’t played the previous games or already forgot what events happened in them, I recommend you to read the first game Yakuza 0 and then its sequel - Yakuza Kiwami before reading this text. Enjoy!

This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, businesses, places, events and incidents are either the products of the author’s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

Chapter 1: LETTER OF BLOOD
[We get to a discotheque. Everyone is having fun and dancing.]

The Early 80s
Kamurocho, Tokyo

[The harsh looking man in a long light brown coat enters the discotheque. He goes out the back door and comes to the door of the neighboring building. The man takes out a revolver and, having prepared himself, slowly opens the door. Having looked around, he goes further. Alarm sounds in the building. Shots are heard from far away. The man is hiding behind a pole. The wounded man comes out of the adjoining corridor. He shoots several times, but his killer aptly shoots him in the hand. This killer turns out to be… Kazama. The man behind the pole looks to look around, attracting Kazama’s attention. At that moment the wounded man tries to shoot, but Kazama is the first to shoot him in the chest several times.]

Wounded Man: (in Korean) […You lying dog! Though I die, we’ll live on… See you in hell!]

[Kazama is leaving. The man in the coat runs up to the wounded.]

Man in Coat: Hey, stay with me…

Wounded Man: My child… I… beg…

[The man wearing the coat runs to the stairs. The top floor is embraced by flames. In one of the rooms he finds a Korean woman with a child.]

Man in Coat: Easy now… I’m not one of them. You’ve got to get out of here! Let me take the kid.

Korean woman: [Stay back! I won’t let you take my baby!]

[She goes to the window, apparently wanting to jump out of it.]

Man in Coat: Don’t!

Korean woman: [Let me go! Just let us die!]

[The man slaps her.]

Man in Coat: That kid’s innocent. Don’t just throw his life away.

[She hands over the child and falls to the floor without any strength left. Some time passes. The same man sitting in his office. There are boxes around it. He plays with his empty revolver.]

Man in Coat: Been a long damn time… Some 20-odd years?

[He recalls the words that the wounded Korean man said before he died.]

[…You lying dog! Though I die, we’ll live on…See you in hell!]

[He imaginary loads an empty gun and shoots at something in his office.]

December 14th, 2006
Kamurocho

[Yuya throws away some guy from Stardust.]

Yuya: Thought you’d come in here and start shit, huh? You think trash like you scares us!?

Man: Hold up.

[Several thugs come to the club. A man thrown out of the club says something to the thugs leader.]

Yuya: You assholes… You’re those Chinese punks raising hell at all those clubs, right?

Thugs Leader: If you know us, that make this easier. Give up your money. All of it!

Yuya: We don’t pay out every shithead who asks. So if you think you can strong-arm us… (strictly and loudly) You’ll have to go through me first!

Thugs Leader: So Japanese do have balls! (pulls out a knife)

[The gang attacks Yuya, but he defeated them quite easily.]

Yuya: Goddamn foreigners! We’re not handing over this town to the likes of you!

[The thugs walk away.]

Stardust Employee: Damn, boss… You the man!

Yuya: (picks up the knife) This town’s gone to the dogs.

Stardust Employee: You think something’s going down? Kinda like last year?

Yuya: Man, I hope not. I sure miss Kiryu-san though…

[Next scene. We climb to the top of a giant building made of glass and concrete. On top of it, a good friend of Kazama-san, Osamu Kashiwagi, is smoking in his office.]

[OSAMU KASHIWAGI. Patriarch of the Kazama Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

[A subordinate of his enters.]

Man: Boss. There’s been an incident outside Stardust.

Kashiwagi: Were they from Kansai?

Man: No, just some foreigners with no sense.

Kashiwagi: …I see.

Man: Should I put some boys on the watch?

Kashiwagi: Leave it.

Man: But boss, there’s been some odd guys -

Kashiwagi: (strictly) I said leave it!

Man: Yes, sir.

Kashiwagi: There’s no telling which spark could ignite a war.

Man: So Kansai is really going to march on Kanto?

Kashiwagi: One of the Omi’s "Four Kings," Terada, is at the top of our ladder now. And I doubt they’re very happy about it. One screw-up could land us in an all-out war, and this isn’t the time for that. You make sure our boys understand… Nobody even blinks without my okay.

Man: Yes, sir.

[The subordinate leaves. Kashiwagi walks to a window.]

Kashiwagi: (to himself) Do we strike first… or bait the attack? Kiryu… How would you handle it?

[We move to the parking lot building where a Korean man talks on his cell phone.]

Korean Man: It’s been over 20 years… We’ve been… waiting for this.

Employer: Whaddaya say we skip the history lesson? Just get those fireworks ready. Ya mind?

Korean Man: Patience, man. This is for all our guys that they took out. We’ve been biding our time… Waiting for the right moment to exact vengeance.

Employer: Maybe try keepin’ yer pep talk to yourself, before someone hears ya.

Korean Man: Don’t worry. I’m a professional. No one notices the fly who stays on the wall.

Employer: Ain’t that nice. But just so we’re clear, I ain’t one of your boys. Seein’ Kamurocho go up in a sea of flames… That’s the common goal here. Once that’s done, we’re strangers. Ya got that?

Korean Man: Sure. You just enjoy the show.

[He hangs up.]

Korean Man: (to himself) A sea of fire’s not enough. That won’t put the souls of those who died in vain to rest…

[Then we see the scene of Kazama’s death from the previous game. It is noteworthy that it is shortened. If you want to recall this scene, I recommend reading the very end of Chapter 12 of the first game.]

Kazama: Please forgive me… Kazuma… Your… Real parents were killed… …By me.

[After that comes the time of death scenes of Yumi and Nishikiyama. For full perception, I recommend reading the last chapter of the first game.]

Yumi/Mizuki: Whether it was one night… Or even just one glance… I wanted to see you once more, Kazuma. And my wish… was granted.

Nishikiyama: No way I’m letting this asshole… get away with it. The responsibility is mine… So let me do this.

Kiryu: Don’t! Don’t do it, Nishiki! Nishiki!

[Kiryu wakes up in sweat.]

Kiryu: Just a dream…

Haruka: What’s with the look on your face?

Kiryu: Hm? Haruka? Where’ve you been? And what’s up with the flowers?

Haruka: You said we’d visit their graves today.

Kiryu: Yeah, I guess I did.

Haruka: Uncle Kaz, are you hungry? I’ll go make us some breakfast.

Kiryu: Thanks… I’ll help you out.

Haruka: It’s fine! I can do it myself. I’ve gotten better over the year, right?

Kiryu: You sure have.

[They come to the cemetery to honor the deceased.]

Kiryu: (Hard to believe it’s been a whole year… People say time heals all wounds. but sometimes they just become scars. And being here opens them all up again.)

[He comes to Kazama’s grave.]

Kiryu: (Has a full year passed since Kazama-san died? Last year had such a huge impact on my life…)

[He decides to remember the events from the last year. We see the footage from the first game.]

Kiryu: Last year, I lost some people who were very dear to me. Thinking back, maybe my fate was sealed on that day, 11 years ago. When I was still a part of the Tojo Clan’s Dojima Family, there were three people I could call my family. One was my best friend from the orphanage where we grew up, Akira Nishikiyama. Another was the man who took me in and raised me like his own son, Shintaro Kazama. And the last… was the childhood friend I’d come to love, Yumi Sawamura. For an orphan like me, those three were the closest thing to a family I had. But…

[We see the scene of Dojima murder.]

Nishikiyama: I killed him… A direct Tojo associate…

Kiryu: (offscreen) What I saw before me was the lifeless body of the Dojima Family patriarch. He’d tried to force himself on Yumi.

Kiryu: (to Yumi) Hey… Talk to me! Nishiki. Take Yumi and get out.

Nishikiyama: What about you?

Kiryu: Just go, Nishiki. Take care of Yumi. Go!

Kiryu: To protect the people closest to me… I made a decision.

[Police burst into the room.]

Prison guard: You may begin eating!

Kiryu: I got 10 years. While I did my time, I got word of my expulsion from the Tojo Clan and Yumi’s disappearance. I was branded for patricide… When the clan cut me off, I felt like a kite without a string. But someone on the outside still remembered me.

[He got a letter.]

Kiryu: Kazama-san…

Kiryu: (offscreen) The man I considered my father. When I made parole, I set out to find him. But also to find out what had happened in Kamurocho during the 10 years I was in jail. A lot about the city had changed…

Nishikiyama: In the presence of all the direct clan patriarchs… Third Chairman, an inquiry… We all know that the clan’s funds are held in the safety of Touto Bank… A sum of 10 billion yen. Is it true then, that it was all stolen?

Kiryu: (offscreen) My former friend had become a different man entirely. And every thug was on the trail of the missing 10 billion.

[Nishikiyama shoots Kazama with a sniper rifle.]

Kiryu: Kazama-san!

Kiryu: (offscreen) A war of succession took root in the Tojo Clan, and I wound up in the middle. Trusting in Kazama-san, I went in search of Yumi, who was connected to everything. But… Who I found instead… was a little girl, all alone.

[Kiryu decides to keep remembering the events of the first game.]

Kiryu: (offscreen) Her name was Haruka. She was only nine years old at the time. Haruka had come into the city all by herself to find her mother. We’d met by pure chance, but there was one thing we had in common.

Kiryu: So what are you going to do now?

Haruka: All I have is my mom and Aunt Yumi. That’s why…

Kiryu: Yumi?

Kiryu: (offscreen) She was looking for her mother, but we were both looking for Yumi. Perhaps it was fate that Haruka and I started searching together. Because then…

Hayashi: We want the little girl ya got there.

Haruka: Huh?

Kiryu: (offscreen) The clan chased her down, believing she was the key to the 10 billion yen. Every day was a new threat… I followed the trail of Yumi and the 10 billion, protecting Haruka the best I could.

Lau: I knew you’d come sooner or later.

Kiryu: (offscreen) And along the way, I crossed paths with a detective. Makoto Date… Formerly a Division One cop. 11 years ago, he’d interrogated me, and his life fell to pieces afterward. To put his career back on track, he asked for my cooperation.

Date: Kiryu, I’m currently investigating the murder of Third Chairman Sera. And you’re gonna help.

Kiryu: (offscreen) A former yakuza partnered with a cop on the same case. It was odd to say the least, but in time, we grew to become friends. Then…

Sudo: Kazuma Kiryu! You’re under arrest for kidnapping!

Kiryu: (offscreen) Sudo, the Division One chief, closed in on us, and I got cornered.

Kiryu: Date-san?

Date: Sorry it took me this long.

Kiryu: This is gonna be bad for you!

Date: Let’s go, Kiryu!

Kiryu: (offscreen) Date-san may have been a cop… But he chose us over the force.

[Kiryu decides to keep remembering.]

Kiryu: (offscreen) The closer we got to the truth, the more people stood in our way. A direct Tojo Clan patriarch after the 10 billion, Futoshi Shimano.

Shimano: We meet again… Kiryu!

Kiryu: (offscreen) And a captain of the Shimano Family, Goro Majima.

Majima: Yo, Kiryu-chan! Been looking for ya.

Kiryu: (offscreen) Every fight against these yakuza veterans was more fierce than the last. Even Sohei Dojima’s widow, Yayoi, confronted me for vengeance.

Yayoi: Dojima’s murderer… Was it you?

Kiryu: (offscreen) Her words weighed heavy on me. But through it all, some were steadfast in their support. The owner of the Stardust host club, Kazuki, and a host there, Yuya. Terada, from the Omi Alliance. The people Kazama-san led me to gave me the courage to press on. And… One man we met brought Haruka and me closer to the truth.

The Florist: Kazuma Kiryu. Out on parole and raising hell already, eh?

Kiryu: (offscreen) The Florist of Sai.. A legendary informant concealed beneath Kamurocho.

The Florist: Here it is, Kiryu. Footage from Serena.

Kiryu: (offscreen) His intelligence revealed the man controlling things from the shadows.

Date: The Florist indicated it could belong to an underground government organization. So I looked into it, and he was on the mark. An underground organization called the "MIA."

Kiryu: (offscreen) A politician was tied to the Tojo Clan’s missing 10 billion. Kyohei Jingu. He’d embezzled the money through the Tojo Clan. And the clan had been his source of income for years. The theft of that money was committed to protect the Tojo Clan from his influence. Then I learned who was behind it.

Kazama: Kazuma. The ones who stole the money… …Were Yumi, Sera, and I.

Kiryu: (offscreen) We’d finally uncovered the truth… But then…

[Shimano throws the grenade.]

Kiryu: Haruka! Kazama-san!

Kiryu: (offscreen) Kazama-san sacrificed himself to protect Haruka, and after revealing the final piece of the puzzle…

Kazama: Please forgive me, Kazuma. Your… Real parents were killed… …By me.

Kiryu: It’s okay. It’s okay, pops. To me… You were my… …My true… (Kazama dies)Father!

Kiryu: (offscreen) He confessed his secret about my past… And then… He passed on.

[Kiryu decides to keep remembering.]

Kiryu: (offscreen) After learning the truth, Haruka and I picked up the money’s trail. The Millennium Tower. Yumi was waiting for us there. Yumi had been Haruka’s mother all along. It was a joyful reunion… But their happiness only lasted a moment.

Kiryu: What’s that!?

Kiryu: (offscreen) Kyohei Jingu came to take back his 10 billion yen. He planned to cut ties with the Tojo Clan and join hands with Kansai’s Omi Alliance. He hoped to unite Japan’s political and criminal worlds under his control. He sprung a trap on Kazama-san’s ally, Terada, the Omi Chief of HQ. Then bared his fangs at us. However…

Jingu: Wh-What!?

[Yumi arms her bomb.]

Kiryu: Yumi!

Yumi/Mizuki: You wouldn’t dare shoot me now. If this explodes, the 10 billion in the bar will go up in smoke.

Kiryu: (offscreen) Thanks to Yumi’s selfless act of bravery… And the ideals Kazama-san passed down to me…

Kiryu: I am… the Tojo Clan’s fourth chairman… Kazuma Kiryu!

Kiryu: (offscreen) We were able to take down Jingu. But when we thought things were finally finished… He walked in.

Nishikiyama: Is it over? I guess now we can settle down.

Kiryu: Nishiki…

Kiryu: (offscreen) Over the decade, we had both changed… Fighting was the only answer we had left. But then… He took mine and Haruka’s lives in his hands… And set us free. Kazama-san… Yumi… And Nishikiyama…. I’d lost my family… and my hope for the future.

Date: Knock it off! Don’t you have something left to fight for!? Don’t you have someone precious to protect!? Don’t run away.

Kiryu: (offscreen) It was Date-san who pulled me up from that pit… And Haruka. I left control of the Tojo Clan to Terada, a man who shared Kazama-san’s ideals. And said farewell to the Tojo Clan life. Instead… I chose to start anew with Haruka.

[Two cars are approaching the cemetery. There’s a familiar face in one of them.]

[YUKIO TERADA. Fifth Chairman of the Tojo Clan.]

Terada: (to his men) I’m goin’ in alone.

Bodyguard: But, sir! That leaves you open to a Kansai ambush…

Terada: This is hallowed ground for souls at rest. They wouldn’t be so crass as to stain this place with more death.

Bodyguard: But, Captain Kashiwagi ordered us to stay close, sir.

Terada: I’m goin’ alone! This conversation’s a private matter.

Bodyguard: Boys, have your steel ready all the same.

Terada’s Men: Yes, sir!

[They take out the short blades. Meanwhile, Kiryu and Haruka are praying at the graves. Haruka at the grave of her mother, Yumi, and Kiryu at the grave of his foster father, Kazama.]

Haruka: Mom… I’ve learned to shop and cook for myself now. Living with Uncle Kiryu has been fun, so don’t worry!

Kiryu: Pops… I don’t know why I’m the only one still alive… But now that I’m finally a real civilian… I plan on bringing Haruka up right.

Terada: Fourth Chairman.

Kiryu: Terada…?

Terada: It’s been a while.

Kiryu: You shouldn’t be out alone.

Terada: I got the boys waiting down yonder. I’ve got something I need to say that’s only for the fourth chairman’s ears…

Kiryu: Lose the "Fourth Chairman." I’m just a civilian now. Anyway, what’s this about?

Terada: I’m hoping to swear an oath with Chairman Goda of the Omi Alliance.

Kiryu: An oath?

Terada: If we’re going to avoid a war with the Omi Alliance, this is the only way.

Kiryu: Are things that grim for the Tojo Clan now?

Terada: The Tojo infrastructure’s still in shambles after what happened last year. If it comes to war, blood will spill, and the Tojo Clan will be devoured by the Omi Alliance. I can’t allow that to come to fruition.

Kiryu: Chairman Goda has all the leverage here. Hard to imagine them coming to the table.

Terada: I know that a dozen times over, but—

Kiryu: Terada. You’re the fifth chairman of the Tojo Clan. I’m retired. It’s not my place to interfere.

Terada: Ex-chairman, how do I navigate the Tojo Clan through this crisis? I just need guidance, please. (bows) Please…

[Kiryu plunges into reflections. At that moment someone shots Terada in his arm. Several thugs go out to them.]

Kiryu: What are you doing here?

Thug: We’re here for Terada-han’s head!

Kiryu: So the Omi sent hitmen from Kansai.

[They throw short blades and pistols of Terada bodyguards at Kiryu’s feet.]

Thug: Tojo Clan bodyguards don’t put up much of a fight.

Terada: What’d you do to my men!?

Thug: Don’t worry, we’ll dig ’em some holes.

Terada: What have you done!?

Thug: We’re in a graveyard. Aren’t ya glad we saved ya the trip?

Kiryu: Take Haruka and get out of here.

Terada: But…

Kiryu: The future of the Tajo Clan rests with you!

[Terada runs away.]

Kiryu: These guys can deal with me instead. I’ll teach you what respect among yakuza means!

[And Kiryu shows what he got! Terada, meanwhile, didn’t run away anywhere, but stands behind a small fence…]

Kiryu: You okay!?

Terada: It’s nothing…

[Suddenly, the last thug with a gun runs out. Kiryu abruptly lifts his weapon from the ground and prepares to shoot, but the thug fires first. Terada covers Kiryu from the bullet.]

Kiryu: Terada!

Terada: Take this…

[He gives Kiryu a letter stained with blood.]

Terada: Take it to the Omi’s… Chairman Goda…

Kiryu: Hey…

Terada: We are cut from different cloth, Kiryu-san. Perhaps this is what’s best for the Tojo Clan. Please… Do this… (passes out)

Kiryu: Terada!

[Next scene. Terada is taken to the hospital by ambulance.]

Kiryu: Terada… Terada!

Haruka: Terada-san…

Kiryu: Stay with me, Terada!

Haruka: Terada-san…!

[Terada’s vitals flattens.]

Doctor: …I’m sorry. The autopsy will be more specific, but I’ll put cause of death as blood loss.

[Kiryu looks at the letter.]

Haruka: I can… stay at Sunflower for a while. You’ve got a job to do now, don’t you? Once it’s over… Come back for me, okay?

[Kiryu looks at the letter. The changes to the Tojo clan meeting. The clan chairwoman, reads Terada’s will.]

Chairwoman: I, the Tojo Clan’s fifth chairman, Yukio Terada, hereby request… …An oath of brotherhood with Chairman Jin Goda of the Omi Alliance… …In sincerest hopes that it may put an end to the long-standing strife between us.

[YAYOI DOJIMA. Acting Chairwoman of the Tojo Clan.]

[A man gets up in the chair and starts to address the acting chairman in a rather rude manner.]

Man: You’re not seriously considering taking this letter to Kansai, are you? Acting Chairman!

Kashiwagi: Calm down!

Man: You can’t just go up to the guys who whacked your boss and ask if they wanna be friends! It’d make a helluva story, though!

Kashiwagi: So you’d have us avenge the fifth chairman’s death?

Man: Kill our kin, we kill yours. That’s the yakuza way!

Man 2: Brother… I’m not taking the heat if you go and do something stupid.

Man: You’d just bend over then!?

Man 2: Financing a war isn’t cheap, you know.

Man: Money, money, money! You call yourselves yakuza!?

Yayoi: Enough! (to Kiryu) So you’re going to Kansai, yes?

Kiryu: I promised the fifth chairman. Ma’am… If you’d allow it… Will you leave this task to me?

Kashiwagi: Kiryu…

Yayoi: You want to avoid all-out war too, then?

Kiryu: I do.

Kashiwagi: I can’t imagine they’ll agree to this…

Kiryu: I’m well aware. Still… This was Terada’s last request.

Yayoi: Slip up, and you’re dead.

Kiryu: I know. I’m prepared for that.

Yayoi: You wouldn’t… Are you looking to trade Chairman Goda’s life for your own?

Kiryu: That all depends on his response.

Yayoi: You’re… Are you still trying to atone for Dojima’s murder 11 years ago? Was that not Nishikiyama’s doing? It isn’t your responsibility to bear.

Kiryu: Nishiki and I… We’d been together since we were kids. We were closer than blood brothers. Any debts Nishiki left are mine to pay now.

Yayoi: Even if I said no… You’d go?

Kiryu: (bows) I’m sorry.

Yayoi: Very well. It’s in your hands, then.

Man: Wait a sec!

Man 2: Lady Chairman… are you sure!? The Omi will never accept!

Man: Think this through!

[Yayoi unsheath a katana in a swift move.]

Yayoi: Kiryu plans to risk his life for the Tojo Clan. Any who object… Step forward now! If this oath fails, there’s no going back! It will mean war between east and west! Knowing that, will you go?

Kiryu: Yes. But I do have one request.

Yayoi: Let’s hear it.

Kiryu: Before I leave for Kansai, there’s someone I need to see.

Yayoi: And that is?

Kiryu: Daigo Dojima. Patriarch Dojima’s son. Your son.

Yayoi: Why, though?

Kiryu: With Terada gone, the Tojo Clan lost a pillar. He’s the only one who can rebuild the clan. There’s no one else I can imagine. He’s not the sort of man who would cave to violence or authority. Right now the Tojo Clan needs a man like him.

Yayoi: Shall I take this as your dying wish?

Kiryu: If that’s how you’d prefer to see it…

Yayoi: You’re…

Kiryu: That’s why I need to speak with Daigo before heading down to Kansai.

Yayoi: I wouldn’t if I were you.

Kiryu: Why not?

Yayoi: Daigo’s not the boy he used to be.

Kiryu: Did something happen?

[Next scene. Kiryu walks through the streets of Kamurocho. The words of the acting chairwoman of the Tojo clan resound in his head.]

Yayoi: You heard that Daigo did time, right?

Kiryu: Yeah… Five years ago, wasn’t it?

Yayoi: You were still in prison at the time. Thinking you’d killed his father. Daigo worked himself into a frenzy. Then he did something stupid…

Kiryu: Stupid?

Yayoi: He made a move on Kansai. …And got busted for it. He did his time, and now he’s back in Kamurocho. He drinks like a fish these days… And parties like the drunken fool he is. He’s like… A puppet who cut free of his strings. Well, you’ll see for yourself.

Kiryu: (Daigo Dojima… Well, let’s see what I can find out.)

Find Daigo Dojima
[Kiryu walks through the busy streets of Kamurocho and notices some scumbags bullying some guy.]

Kiryu: Is there a problem here?

Handa: H-Help me, please!   

Thug: Huh? Who the hell are you? Mind your own business and piss off. And keep your mouth shut, Handa! Or are you tryin’ to die!?

Handa: Urk…

Kiryu: …….

Thug: Huh? You got an attitude problem!? Maybe we’ll get warmed up on you, then!

[Kiryu beats their sorry asses.]

Thug: Sonuvabitch! I’ll remember this, Handa!

[Thugs run away.]

Handa: Th-Thank you so much!

Kiryu: What happened?

Handa: See, I asked this guy to settle his tab, but then his goons got up in my face…

Kiryu: Who? The guy with the tab, I mean.

Handa: Some yakuza punk named Daigo Dojima. He was headed toward the theater, but I’m sure he’s long gone now. Oh, and thanks for saving me there. You can have this. (gives a piece of equipment)

[As Kiryu enters the square, a girl runs up to him.]

Rika: Help me!

Kiryu: What’s going on here?

Rika: This drunk came up and groped me! I told him off, but then he hit me!

Kiryu: Did he now…

Thug: Oh, does somebody wanna play hero today? Then I’ll give ya a hero’s death!

[Kiryu punches the pervert into the ground.]

Rika: How can I ever thank you…

Kiryu: Who attacked you?

Rika: Daigo Dojima’s goons. Maybe you’ve heard of him? He and his boys are always getting drunk and causing a scene.

Kiryu: They were Daigo’s? You know where he is?

Rika: I wouldn’t go looking for trouble, sir.

Kiryu: I can’t handle him. Where is he?

Rika: Inside Club Shine, where I work. I’ll take you there.

[She leads Kiryu to the club called Shine.]

Rika: Here we are. Be careful…

[Kiryu enters the club and find Daigo.]

Kiryu: It’s been a while… We need to talk.

Thug: Hey, who gave you permission to talk to aniki?

Kiryu: Aniki….?

Thug 2: Yeah, asshole! So get lost!

Kiryu: I said I need to talk to this kid.

Thug: You calling aniki a kid now!?

Kiryu: This has nothing to do with you. You mind giving us just a minute?

Thug: Fuck that! I already told you to back the fuck up!

Kiryu: Let’s not cause a scene in here. Step outside.

[Kiryu and a dozen thugs walk out of the club. One of them tries to sneakily hit Kiryu from behind, but he trips him up and the bastard falls into a puddle.]

Kiryu: I’m surprised guys like you still hang around this town.

Thug: The fuck you mean by that!?

Kiryu: Guys who don’t know their place…That’s all.

Thug: Think you’re funny? I’ll teach you to keep your goddamn mouth shut! Get him!

[Kiryu beats the punks up.]

Kiryu: I’ve got nothing against you guys… So don’t make me hurt you any more.

Thug: (pulls out a knife) Shut up!

Kiryu: If you’re gonna get flashy… "Sorry" isn’t going to cut it.

Daigo: That’s enough.

Thug: Aniki…

Daigo: He’s way out of your league.

Thug: Yeah, but he…!

Daigo: Go back inside. Do as I say!

Thug: Yes, sir…

[The thugs run away.]

Daigo: They’re not very disciplined. They’ve never sworn up. They just started calling me "aniki" and following me around.

Kiryu: Your charisma always drew people to you.

Daigo: Well I’m done with people all the same.

Kiryu: Please, come back to the Tojo Clan. They need you.

Daigo: Yeah, well I don’t need them. Just leave me alone.

Kiryu: Your mother told me what happened.

Daigo: Did she? All the more reason to leave me alone.

Kiryu: I’m afraid I can’t. The whole clan’s at stake.

Daigo: I don’t care what happens to the clan.

Kiryu: You owe them a lot, Daigo. You’re only who you are today… …Because of them. Because of your father, Patriarch Dojima.

Daigo: What gives you the right to say that? Look, Kiryu-san. You were the only guy I could trust. You were my fucking hero. But not anymore. After dad died, the clan started falling apart at the seams. And now…? It’s not even worth risking my ass to save.

Kiryu: You’re pretty sharp.

Daigo: Huh?

Kiryu: You’re exactly right… As it stands, the Tojo Clan isn’t worth dying for. The officers are busy counting their money, and any power they had is gone. But still… For my part… I have faith.

Daigo: In what?

Kiryu: Guys like Kazama-san and Shimano… And… How strong the clan was under them and your father. If the Tojo Clan’s going to make a comeback… It’s going to need you.

Daigo: Oh, that’s rich coming from you… Aren’t you the one who fucked it all up last year!?

Kiryu: Yeah. That’s why I’m back… To take responsibility for it!

[He punches Daigo.]

Daigo: What the fuck, man…

Kiryu: Well? Are you waking up yet?

Daigo: You never change… You’ve always tried to punch your problems.

Kiryu: That’s the only way I’ve ever known…

Daigo: I’m the same way. If something’s charging me… I charge right at it!

[He fights Kiryu and loses. Kiryu hands him Terada’s will.]

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan’s entire future rests on this.

[Some time passes. Daigo reads the will.]

Kiryu: I’m going to Kansai tomorrow. I might not make it back alive. That’s why I need you to hold down the fort…

Daigo: Fuck that. I’m not letting you go play hero alone.

Kiryu: But the Tojo Clan… Please.

Daigo: No way. I’m coming with.

Kiryu: What?

Daigo: Look, I’ve got a score to settle in Kansai.

Kiryu: What score?

Daigo: Five years ago, they set me up. And ever since, my life’s been shit. I’m not going back to yakuza life until I’ve settled accounts.

Kiryu: Daigo…

Daigo: Doesn’t matter what you say. I don’t even care if you stay or go. I’m going.

[He hands over the will to Kiryu.]

Kiryu: Hey…

Daigo: I’ll be waiting at the station tomorrow. See you there.

Chapter 2: THE DRAGON OF KANSAI
[Night. Kiryu and Daigo take the high-speed train to Kansai.]

Kiryu: Hey… Your fight five years ago… Who’d you face?

Daigo: The second patriarch of the Omi Alliance’s Go-Ryu Clan, Ryuji Goda. He’s the son of the chairman we’re heading to meet, Jin Goda.

Kiryu: The chairman’s son…

Daigo: I was an idiot… I fell right into his little trap.

Kiryu: A trap?

Daigo: Yeah… Five years ago, the Go-Ryu Clan was making regular visits up to Kamurocho.

Kiryu: Were they after the old Dojima Family?

Daigo: It didn’t matter. Any Tojo officer would do. Their plan was to poke at the Tojo until they came down to Kansai. I was pretty reckless back then, and I jumped at the bait.

Kiryu: You made a move on Kansai?

Daigo: All by myself. I flew out to Kansai for a one-on-one fight with Ryuji Goda. But when I got there, the cops were waiting. Got busted for carrying, and then it was shit jail food for five years. Not that I can complain to a guy who ate it for twice that. So I still owe one to Ryuji Goda. Until I settle this, I can’t carry the Tojo Clan…

Kiryu: I see…

Daigo: The Omi Alliance doesn’t fuck around. Who knows what they’ve got up their sleeve? This oath thing… You better be careful.

Kiryu: Yeah…

[They arrive in Sotenbori.]

Daigo: Yo, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: Yeah?

Daigo: You headed straight to the hotel?

Kiryu: I haven’t given it much thought.

Daigo: Yeah, well… Like I said, I’ve got nothing but bad memories here. Doesn’t exactly put me in the mood to hit the town.

Kiryu: I think I’ll go for a walk, then. You get some rest.

Daigo: Right, maybe I’ll do just that. Stay on your toes, though. This isn’t Kamurocho.


Kiryu: Same to you. Don’t overdo it if you hit the bars. Later.

[Daigo leaves.]

Sotenbori Thug: Hey! Where do ya think you’re goin’, pal? I ain’t seen you around before! Guy like you should know yer place. Quit struttin’ around like a damn peacock.

Yeah, uh… my bad?
I peacocked your mom. +

Sotenbori Thug: Oh, a wise guy! I’ll sink your smart ass in the river! Hope ya believe in an afterlife, buddy!

[Kiryu shows the thug his place… on the ground.]

Sotenbori Thug: Damn! Sorry I called ya a peacock! Maybe somethin’ got lost in translation…

[He runs away. A man in a purple suit shouts to Kiryu.]

Kurokawa: Hey, just a sec! Hold on now, I ain’t no trouble, buddy! Whew… Did ya think I was yakuza, buddy? Can’t say I blame ya. what with my mean mug. Runs in the family. Mama’s side, y’know? I tell folks I ain’t yakuza, and they still run off screamin’ bloody murder… For real, how’s an honest man s’posed to do business in this damn town? At this rate, I may as well join a yakuza clan! Would serve ‘em right! …Annnnywho, I just saw ya drop that blowhard. You’re a real bruiser, eh? Numbskull there was givin’ me shit, too. Oh, I’m Kurokawa by the way. It means "black river," but my heart’s white as snow and pure as a pretty lady. Speakin’ of pretty ladies, boy, mine sure wasn’t. Had a face like a porkchop. Almost glad she ran off, y’know? …Annnnnywho, what’s yer name, fella?

Kiryu: It’s Kiryu.

Kurokawa: Kiryu-han, eh? First time in Osaka? Glad to have ya either way. …Annnnnywho, I owe ya one for dunkin’ that dipstick. But what to give ya? Hmmmm… Anything you’re after, buddy? Tell ya what, I got dirt on this whole city. Ya need info, you just scooch on up for a scoop. I’ll be around if ya need me, buddy!

[Kiryu explores the city. It’s been ages since he has been there. He eats in a restaurant and visits popular local cabaret called Grand.]

Customer: Man, this is bullshit! I was upstairs enjoyin’ the VIP seats when a pack of yakuza-lookin’ heavies busted in… Then I get bounced down here!? I was on the waiting list for three months to get those seats!

Staff: I’m terribly sorry, sir. How can we make this up for you?

[There’s something fishy is going on there. Kiryu goes to talk about it with Kurokawa.]

Kiryu: What can you tell me about the VIP seats at the Cabaret Grand?

Kurokawa: The Cabaret Grand? You mean the pride of Sotenbori down there? Did’ya know Maki Kuraishi got her start there? She’s a movie star now! I knew a man like you would have great taste, Kiryu-han. Annnnywho, I got this guy who takes care of butt beads. Hemorrhoids, I mean. Well, that guy’s nephew’s teacher’s sister’s hubby gots this twin brother who plays mahjong with the Grand’s owner. Tell ya what. I owe ya one, so I’ll put in a call to my butt guy… He’ll talk to his nephew’s teacher’s sister’s hubby’s twin brother’s mahjong friend… And I’ll get ya up in those VIP seats. Just uh, gimme a few… (calling) Yello? Yeah, hey bud. How’s the butt clinic? Ya know that guy at the Grand who plays mahjong with your nephew’s teacher’s sis’s hubby’s twin bro? Yeah, I need ya to call in a fav - Eh? Whaddaya mean, “who is this!?” It’s Kurokawa, ya blowhard! I said it’s Kurokawa! Get your damn ears checked! Anyway, I need VIP seats at the Grand for a good buddy o’mine. Whaddaya mean it’s full up with real VIPs!? Ya tryin’ to piss me off!? Look pal, I got pics of you balls deep in some chick who ain’t exactly your wife, hear? I’m sure there’s room for one more narrow ass in those VIP seats! Oh, ya think that’s funny? How funny is it gonna be if my finger slips and hits "send" right now? …Right, right. I knew ya’d see it my way. My boy’s name is Kiryu. Mighty generous of ya, friend. (hangs up) Kiryu-han, there’s your VIP seats at the Cabaret Grand all sorted. Apparently, they’re pretty hard to get. Invitation only, yeah? Anyhow, shame I can’t do more for ya. Knock ’em dead tonight, buddy!

Kiryu: ……

[He goes back to Grand.]

Kiryu: Hi. I’m supposed to be on a list, courtesy of Kurokawa.

VIP Employee: You must be Kiryu-sama, then? I do have your name, sir. Is this your first visit to the VIP section, sir? Please make your way right up these stairs.

Yuko: Welcome! I’m Yuko. A pleasure to have ya, sir!

[While beautiful girls in red dresses dance on the first floor stage, on the VIP second floor the businessmen and other wealthy residents discuss business and have fun. Kiryu smokes a cigarette and chats with a hostess named Yuko.]

Yuko: Not from around here, are ya, sir?

Kiryu: Right.

Yuko: Here on vacation?

Kiryu: Not really…

Yuko: Oh, business, then?

Kiryu: Well, that’s not far off…

Rude Customer: Hey! Let’s get more ladies over here! Where’s the fuckin’ manager!?

Yuko: Careful! Don’t make eye contact with ’em. He’s a bigshot yakuza in these parts.

Scared Waiter: Y-Yes, sir? Can I help you?

Yakuza: No other joint in Kansai would leave our table this empty!

Scared Waiter: (bows) I-I’m terribly sorry!

Yakuza 2: Quit bowin’ like a goddamn chicken… And get your finest bitches over at our table!

Yakuza Boss: Watch yer fuckin’ mouth. Move along.

Yakuza: B-Boss! Thank you very much!

Hostess: You’re amazing, boss! Spoken like a king!

Yakuza 3: You’re damn right! Don’t tell me a gal in your line of work doesn’t know this guy… Future chairman of the Omi Alliance… The Dragon of Kansai. Remember that!

Hostess: Wow!

[Yakuza Boss still looks menacingly tense.]

Yakuza 3: S-Something wrong? What, is it her?

Yakuza 2: Not quite… Ya wanna repeat that?

Yakuza 3: Huh?

Yakuza 2: Drawin’ a blank already?

Yakuza Boss: Take a walk, will ya ladies?

Yakuza 3: U-Uh… Did I..?

Yakuza 2: What’s the one thing the boss don’t ever wanna hear?

Yakuza 3: Oh, uh…

Yakuza 2: Ya gonna hurry the fuck up and apologize!?

Yakuza 3: (bows to the ground) I… I’m real sorry!

Yakuza Boss: Look at ya. Pathetic. Get yer ass back on the chair.

[He picks up a bottle of alcohol and takes a few big sips. Then he offers his drink to Yakuza 3, who is shaking with fear.]

Yakuza Boss: Yamada… How long ya been runnin’ with me now?

Yamada: T-Two years…

Yakuza Boss: I see.

[He keeps pouring alcohol into the glass even though the glass has long been full.]

Yamada: Uhh… Boss?

Yakuza Boss: So, remembered what ya said yet?

Yamada: Um, I, uh…

Yakuza Boss: C’mon, drink up.

Yamada: O-Oh, uh… Thank you.

[He drinks alcohol, while the Boss hits him over the head with an empty bottle, grabs him by the collar and treats him with the neck of the bottle left in his hands.]

Yakuza Boss: That jog yer memory!? I want ya to repeat that shit!

[A calm voice comes from afar.]

Kiryu: The Dragon of Kansai. He called you the Dragon of Kansai.

Yuko: H-Hey, are ya nuts!?

Kiryu: Kinda tough to relax in here.

[He walks up to the Yakuza table.]

Yakuza: Hold it! Ya got balls sayin’ that shit!

Kiryu: He said he wanted to hear it repeated.

Yakuza 4: Ya got an eavesdroppin’ problem, too!?

[Kiryu is surrounded.]

Kiryu: As loud as you were shouting, it’s not like I had much choice.

[Yakuza 4 hits Kiryu over the head with a bottle, but Kiryu doesn’t even blink. A confused Yakuza 4 tries to attack Kiryu with the neck of his bottle, but Kiryu throws him off the side of the floor onto the piano.]

Yakuza: We’ve got a tough guy, eh!? Want me to sink yer ass in Osaka Bay!? Get ready to die!

[Kiryu defeats the Omi yakuzas.]

Yakuza Boss: (clapping) Pretty good! I owe ya an apology. My boys can get trigger happy.

[Kiryu walks away.]

Yakuza Boss: Leaving so soon?

Kiryu: Guys like you make for sour drinks.

Yakuza Boss: (laughs) You’re a real piece o’ work! I like ya! At least lemme buy a round for yer trouble.

Kiryu: I’ll pass.

Yakuza Boss: The Omi’s Go-Ryu Clan is offering ya a drink. C’mon, spare me the shame of it all.

Kiryu: Go-Ryu Clan…

Yakuza Boss: Alright! Gimme the priciest bottle in the house! Let’s go!

Yakuza: Yes, sir!

Yakuza Boss: You’re a real ballbuster, pal. My clan ain’t got any guys like you. Ya from Kanto, friend?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Yakuza Boss: Figured as much. If a guy like you was a Kansai man, I’da heard the rumors by now. And now that we’re through the pleasantries, how’s about yer name?
[Kiryu stays silent.]

Yakuza Boss: How rude o’ me… I’m the second patriarch of the Omi Alliance’s Go-Ryu Clan… Name’s Ryuji Goda.

[RYUJI GODA. Patriarch of the Go-Ryu Clan, an Omi Alliance subsidiary.]

Kiryu: Goda…

[He sits on a couch.]

Ryuji: Surely ya’ve heard of the Omi Alliance? It’s practically the most recognizable sigil in Japan…

Kiryu: Yeah.

Ryuji: Now… What’s yer name?

Kiryu: I wouldn’t say I’m anyone special.

Ryuji: I’ve laid my cards out on the table here. Least a guy can do is tell me his name.

Kiryu: Kiryu… Kazuma Kiryu.

Ryuji: The Dragon of Dojima. The Tojo Clan’s Kazuma Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: No. That’s not who I am.

Ryuji: (laughs) Ya had me goin’ for a sec…! Don’t go scarin’ me like that! Not that you could be him anyway. If ya were, no way you’d be sittin’ here sippin’ drinks right now.

Kiryu: And why’s that?

Ryuji: ‘Cause you’d have yer hands full already. You’d be gettin’ ready for war, fast as ya could. Aw, screw it! Might as well fill ya in. Ya know why I lost my cool back there?

Kiryu: Why?

Ryuji: I hate bein’ called the Dragon of Kansai. Dragon, I don’t mind. But the Kansai part pisses me off. A dragon don’t know Kansai or Dojima. We only need one dragon in our world. Ain’t room for more. Wouldn’t ya say?

Kiryu: …Maybe so.

Ryuji: (laughs) Guess we see eye to eye. Must be fate, eh? While I’m on a roll, here’s another hot tip. At midnight tonight… Kamurocho’s gonna see the biggest damn fireworks show ever.

Kiryu: Fireworks?

Ryuji: Just a little show I’m puttin’ on. The festival of a lifetime’s set to start, my friend.

Kiryu: A festival?

Ryuji: And the fireworks over Kamurocho are just the opening ceremony. Because then, tomorrow… The Dragon of Dojima… …Dies.

Kiryu: What?

Ryuji: And I become the one true dragon. …But I’ve talked yer ear off. Kick back and relax, Kiryu-san. Enjoy yer evening. Oh right… One more thing. If ya decide to join us… Wear some damn cologne or somethin’.

Kiryu: What’s that supposed to mean?

Ryuji: I could smell ya the moment ya walked in. You reek of blood. Kazuma Kiryu-san.. …Later.

[He and his crew leave.]

Kiryu: (to himself) Fireworks? At midnight…? What the hell is he planning?

[Kiryu looks at his watch. It’s already midnight. He leaves the cabaret and overhead two men speaking.]

Concerned Man: You hear about the explosion?

Excitable Man: They’re runnin’ the news on that big outdoor screen!

Kiryu: (Something’s wrong… I need to figure out what.)

[Kiryu lunges into the square. Meanwhile a deafening explosion on the top floor of a huge tower in the center of Kamurocho. He sees a news report on the screen that reads ミレニアムタワー爆発事故?! (Millennium Tower explosion!?).]

News Reporter: Moments ago at midnight, a violent explosion shook Kamurocho’s Millennium Tower. Details have yet to be confirmed, but reports suggest the source of explosion… …was the offices of a suspected-criminal organization, and that it may not be accidental.

Kiryu: This is it… The fireworks…

[Meanwhile, many police cars and medics arrive in the square. A detective from the beginning of the game walks into camera view.]

Detective: So it’s begun…

[He leaves the square. In the next scene we move to 警視庁神室警察署 Kamuro District Police Station. /a little clarification for those who don’t know Japanese - the prefix “cho” means "district" just as in shiba inu “inu” just means “a dog”/ Junichi Sudo speaking on the phone.]

Junichi Sudo: Yes. Sudo speaking. Yes, I’m afraid so… Just as you predicted, Chief Kurahashi.

[JUNICHI SUDO. Metropolitan Police Division Four: Organized Crime.]

Sudo: No, there’s no link to Kansai yet. Yes, that’s correct. I have my suspicions about foreign syndicate involvement as well. I see. Understood. I’ll make the arrangements. Yes. Date-san’s the only one capable of that. Right… Goodbye.

Chapter 3: THE YAKUZA HUNTRESS
[Kiryu meets with Daigo.]

Daigo: Hell of a night, huh?

Kiryu: In more ways than one…

Daigo: You mean something besides a bombing back home?

Kiryu: Just a little run-in I had in town.

Daigo: Hm?

Kiryu: Nothing you need to worry about. But you should probably call to check in on Kashiwagi-san when you can.

Daigo: Yeah, I will. Just let me know when you’re ready to head for Omi HQ.

Kiryu: All right.

Daigo: Ready to go?

Actually, just a second.
I’m all set. +

Kiryu: Yeah, I’m all set.

Daigo: All right. There’s no turning back now.

Kiryu: Yeah. This is it.

Daigo: Let’s roll, then.

Elsewhere in Sotenbori…

[We enter the office of some Yakuza Boss.]

[For those who are curious about what is written on the board, I will assume that it is 任侠 “chivalry, generosity”. As for 尤牌生 I will assume that it is a Chinese manufacturer of such boards, which is pronounced, apparently, Yubaisheng. Also, I will cautiously assume that it must be some kind of joke or irony that you won’t find chivalry or generosity in this room.]

Yakuza Boss: Detective… I would never threaten a civilian! Surely this is some kinda mix-up?

Woman Detective: When ya met with the president of Kojima Realty at that café… Were ya not poundin’ on the table?

[KAORU SAYAMA. Osaka Prefectural Police Detective Division Four: Organized Crime.]

Yakuza Boss: I’d hardly call it a poundin’. More of a little… More of a line. Tap! (softly hits his table) That’s all it was.

Kaoru: Sounds like extortion to me.

Yakuza Boss: You’re kiddin’, right!? Pinch us on trumped up charges like that and we won’t be able to keep food on the table!

Kaoru: Shoulda thought of that before ya started droppin’ your second-string family’s name to scare civilians.

Yakuza Boss: (gets up from his chair) Second-string family!? And here I was keepin’ this civil on account of you bein’ a chick!

Kaoru: Keep your goddamn chivalry!

[She smashes the glass on the board that says 任侠 with her wooden sword.]

Yakuza Boss: What the fuck, lady!?

Kaoru: Real yakuza hustle to score big, not to scare up chump change! Book him. Extortion, assault, tax evasion… We’ll get the whole sorry story at the station.

[Two policemen seize the yakuza boss.]

Yakuza Boss: Get your hands offa me, asshole!

[He pouches one of the policemen.]

Kaoru: …And now resistin’ arrest for the cherry on top.

[Next scene. Police Station.]

Police Chief: The Omi Alliance and the Tojo Clan strikin’ up an accord!?

Man on the Phone: That’s what our intel says.

Police Chief: What, then, would the mighty Tokyo PD have us do exactly?

Man on the Phone: Take Kazuma Kiryu into custody, please.

Police Chief: Huh?

Man on the Phone: If the peace talks fail, and Kiryu gets killed, there’ll be no stopping the bloodshed.

Police Chief: So what yer sayin’ is ya want the cops to babysit a yakuza?

[Kaoru overhears the conversation.]

Police Chief: Yes, pretty much. Time is short, so we’re counting on you here. (hungs up)

[TSUTOMU BESSHO. Osaka Prefectural Police Chief Division Four: Organized Crime.]

Tsutomu: They think they run the fuckin’ show!

Kaoru: Chief… What was that all about?

Tsutomu: Eh? Yeah, that was Tokyo’s Division Four.

Kaoru: What’d ya mean, "babysit a yakuza"?

Tsutomu: Seems Kazuma Kiryu hotfooted into Kansai.

Kaoru: Kiryu… Ya mean…

Tsutomu: Yep, that one. Tojo Clan fourth chairman. If he bites it in our backyard, it’ll be an east versus west shitstorm. So they’re askin’ us to play bodyguard. What a fuckin’ mess…

Kaoru: Fine… Put me on it, then.

Tsutomu: Oh hell no. When I need a sitter, you ain’t exactly who I’d call.

Kaoru: Ain’t this our big chance?

Tsutomu: Chance how?

Kaoru: We take responsibility for Kazuma Kiryu… And with him in protective custody he’s our ticket to investigate in Kanto, yeah?

Tsutomu: What, you’re gonna bust into Kanto and show ’em how it’s done in Osaka? Wipe off those smug-ass Tokyo grins?

Kaoru: Dependin’ where it leads, we could deploy the whole force.

Tsutomu: Yeah, that’d be a hoot… "Osakan police invade Kanto! Film at 11."

Kaoru: So I got the job?

Tsutomu: Hey, now just a minute! You ain’t still hung-up on the Tojo Clan, are ya?

Kaoru: …No, sir! I’m askin’ as lead detective of Osaka PD Division Four here.

Tsutomu: Swear on it?

Kaoru: …Yeah.

Tsutomu: Alright. You’re off the leash!

Kaoru: Got it!

[Next scene. Kiryu approaches the Omi Alliance gate, decorated with their symbol 近江.]

Daigo: So that explosion… Blew the Kazama Family office to shit. Patriarch Kashiwagi’s all right, though.

Kiryu: That’s good…

Daigo: Don’t suppose it was the Omi, do you?

Kiryu: Most likely Ryuji Goda.

Daigo: Huh?

Kiryu: Yeah, I met him last night in Sotenbori.

Daigo: You did?

[The gate opens. Behind them we see a lot of people lined up in two rows. One of them brings in the arriving yakuza.]

Omi Yakuza: We’ve been expectin’ you.

Kiryu: Let’s go.

Daigo: Y-Yeah…

Omi Yakuzas: Welcome!

Daigo: They should be on the top floor. Let’s head up.

Go to the Omi Alliance HQ top floor
Kiryu: (The interior’s layout is pretty complex. Maybe it’s meant to slow down intruders?)

Omi Alliance Member: Straight into the back, sir.

[Kiryu and Daigo enter a large dojo-like hall. They sit on the floor on special cushions. There are several people sitting across from them. After a few minutes more people enter, one of whom is carrying an old yakuza with a long white beard in a wheelchair.]

Old Yakuza: You’ve come quite a ways. Welcome. I am the fifth chairman of the Omi Alliance, Jin Goda. (bows)

[JIN GODA. Fifth Chairman of the Omi Alliance.]

Jin Goda: I’ve heard the rumors, Fourth Chairman Kiryu.

Kiryu: I graciously accept your hospitality… (bows) As the Tojo Clan’s fourth chairman, Kazuma Kiryu.

Jin Goda: Let’s dispense with the formalities, then. Allow me to introduce my officers. Beside me is chief director of Omi Headquarters, Takashima. He took over Terada’s chief of HQ position.

Takashima: (politely bows) A pleasure to meet you.

[RYO TAKASHIMA. Patriarch of the Takashima Family, an Omi Alliance subsidiary.]

Kiryu: You’re Terada’s…

Takashima: Yes, Terada – No, the Tojo Clan’s fifth chairman, was my sworn brother. What happened was… extremely unfortunate.

Jin Goda: Next to him…

Daigo: Wait a minute! Hey… You wanna repeat that crap? Unfortunate? That some kinda sick joke? You assholes are the ones that killed him!

[Kiryu swiftly stops Daigo.]

Takashima: Terada’s death is on the Omi’s hands, yes… However… That was not the chairman’s will.

Daigo: Bullshit! You think that excuses you!?

[Some yakuza throws a fan on the floor.]

Yakuza: Quit your yappin’, junior.

Daigo: Huh?

Yakuza: Look, a meetin’ like this is for folks with status.

[TORANOSUKE SENGOKU. Patriarch of the Sengoku Family, an Omi Alliance subsidiary.]

Toranosuke: Kid like you oughta let the big boys do the talkin’. Eh? Am I right, Tojo Fourth Chairman-han!?

Takashima: Enough, Sengoku. That was rude.

Kiryu: I apologize. The first offense was ours.

Jin Goda: I am truly saddened by what happened to Terada. I hope you’ll accept my deepest apologies.

Toranosuke: Back it up a sec! Ain’t no need for apologies here! Terada was one o’ ours to begin with. Shouldn’t matter none to you how our side deals with traitors.

Takashima: Sengoku!

Daigo: (stands up) What a goddamn farce.

Toranosuke: Ehh?

Daigo: We’re supposed to believe you’re sorry? Really, Goda-san? Only a year ago… You went behind Terada’s back to ally with Jingu so you could take over the Tojo Clan. Don’t even try to deny it!

Jin Goda: It’s true… However, that was neither me nor my officers’ doin’.

Daigo: Really? Quit shifting all the blame!

Takashima: Kiryu-san, Dojima-san… This is a difficult subject for Chairman Goda. If you’ll allow me… The Jingu incident last year was an independent act of the Go-Ryu Clan patriarch.

Daigo: What!?

Kiryu: Ryuji?

Takashima: So you know him… He’s the chairman’s son. He failed to learn his father’s temperance. He wields the Omi sigil as he pleases… I suspect that the ones who attacked Terada were also the Go-Ryu Clan.

Kiryu: Then… Ryuji’s the one who ordered Terada’s death?

Takashima: Most likely.

Toranosuke: This is stupid. I’m done here.

Takashima: Sengoku!

Toranosuke: What? Handle this however ya damn please. If ya need money to cover Terada’s incense, just lemme know, yeah? l’d be happy to spot ya a bil or two. …Later.

[He picks up his fan and leaves.]

Jin Goda: Kiryu-san, this is the current state of the Omi Alliance. 120 families, over 35,000 men… The Alliance has grown too large. It’s nearly impossible to control.

Takashima: Fifth Chairman…

Jin Goda: Takashima here’s a sharp one. Terada was the same way. That said… The young blood like Sengoku and Ryuji don’t much care to listen.

Kiryu: Goda-san…

Jin Goda: Kiryu-san, losing Terada is a heavy blow for both Tojo and Omi alike… I feel that now’s the time to balance the power of east and west and uproot the seeds of conflict.

Kiryu: Balance them, sir?

Jin Goda: Exactly. Kiryu-san, I believe you’re capable of this. I want to see ya rebuild the Tojo Clan. And if the Omi can be of help along the way, then I’d gladly assist.

[Kiryu stands up and walks to Jin Goda. He politely hands over Terada’s will to him.]

Jin Goda: What’s this?

Kiryu: A letter Terada wrote. He wanted an alliance, Chairman Goda.

Jin Goda: Terada…

Kiryu: And the Tojo Clan echoes Terada’s wish. An oath of equal alliance. Will you accept that?

Jin Goda: I will accept.

Kiryu: Thank you. I’ll send for the Tojo Clan’s acting chairman, Yayoi Dojima, to come at once.

Jin Goda: I should say not. It’s our turn to make the trip. I’ll head up to Kamurocho.

Kiryu: Very well. You have our gratitude.

[Suddenly a lot of armed men burst into the room.]

Ryuji: So ya were the real Dragon of Dojima after all, Kiryu-han.

Jin Goda: Ryuji!

Ryuji: The Tojo and the Omi in a 50-50 alliance? Sure it ain’t 80-20? Shit, more like 90-10?

Jin Goda: Why’d you come here? Ya don’t belong amongst Omi officers!

[Daigo stands in Ryuji’s way.]

Ryuji: Eh? What’s up?

Daigo: Do I look familiar?

Ryuji: Nope.

Daigo: You set me up five years ago. I’m Sohei Dojima’s son, Daigo.

Ryuji: I said I don’t know ya.

Daigo: This isn’t about the oath… You and I… have some unfinished business!

[He tries to hit Ryuji, but Ryuji sharply stabs him in the stomach with his tanto sheath.]

Ryuji: Can’t expect me to remember every scrub. Sit down. Take a nap or somethin’.

Jin Goda: What’s this about!?

Ryuji: Do it!

[Ryuji’s men surround the patriarchs of the families and put guns to their heads.]

Jin Goda: What’re you doing!? What’s the meaning of this!?

Kiryu: You… You even know where you are?

Ryuji: What kinda question is that?

Kiryu: This is Omi Alliance Headquarters!

Ryuji: Ya think I don’t know that? This here’s what I call a coup.

Kiryu: What the hell?

Ryuji: Can’t have my old man here talkin’ peace with the Tojo Clan now. He finalizes an alliance, then my plans get shot to shit.

[Ryuji’s men take the patriarchs out of the room.]

Kiryu: Is that what you’re after… A war?

Ryuji: Sure is. The east versus the west. That’s all I want… Well, that and one more thing…

Kiryu: Me?

Ryuji: Damn right. Yer head on a platter. Think yer worth the hassle? I say we find out!

[Kiryu defeats Go-Ryu Clan yakuzas.]

Ryuji: (clapping) Damn, what a beast! And here I thought ya were tough last night! I prefer a challenge. More fun than takin’ out chumps.

[Daigo wakes up and punches Ryuji. He falls on his ass.]

Ryuji: What the fuck are ya doin’?

Daigo: I’m not gonna let you ignore me. I told you we had unfinished business! Kiryu-san, this one’s mine. You go help Chairman Goda.

Kiryu: All right.

Ryuji: Ain’t you a spunky one? Oh well, though… You wanna die so bad… I’II send your ass to hell first!

Rescue Chairman Goda
[Kiryu runs for Chairman Goda punching sorry ass yakuzas on the way. He saves him.]

Jin Goda: Kiryu-san… This is my son’s mess… And makin’ you help clean it up… I don’t have the words…

Kiryu: Tojo, Omi… It doesn’t matter. Don’t trouble yourself, sir.

[A badly beaten Daigo comes out to them. He falls to the ground.]

Kiryu: Keep it together!

Daigo: Kiryu-san… That guy’s… a real tank.

Ryuji: This ain’t even over!

Kiryu: Daigo… Take Chairman Goda. Get back to the Tojo.

Daigo: I still owe this guy a—

Kiryu: Right now, getting Chairman Goda to swear the oath with the Tojo Clan is the priority! Besides… We can’t afford to lose you here.

Daigo: But if I leave it like this…

Kiryu: Just listen to me, damn it!

Daigo: …Fine

[He leaves with the chairman.]

Ryuji: Finally down to the two of us…

Kiryu: The chairman’s with the Tajo Clan now. I’m not letting anything stop this alliance.

Ryuji: Fine, fine… One more thing to do after I kill ya, then.

Kiryu: Think you can?

Ryuji: Yeah… Only room for one dragon… Let’s see which one of us is real!

[The fateful fight between two dragons begins!]

Ryuji: This is where ya die!

[Ryuji Goda appears to be super tough but Kiryu manages to endure the fight and wins!]

Ryuji: This ain’t over by a longshot!

Kiryu: I never could abide an unfair fight.

Ryuji: ’Scuse me?

Kiryu: You just had it out with Daigo. He’s pretty tough. You were in no condition to fight.

Ryuji: I ain’t done til one of us ain’t breathin!

[Police sirens are heard.]

Ryuji: Fuck! Don’t forget… I ain’t through with you!

[He runs away.]

Kaoru: Cuff anyone who’s still here!

Policemen: Yes, ma’am!

Kaoru: Kazuma Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: That’s me.

Kaoru: Detective Kaoru Sayama, Osaka Police. You’re under arrest for assault.

[She cuffs Kiryu.]

Chapter 4: THE FOUR KINGS OF OMI
[Next scene. Police station. Date walks in a corridor and bumps into some lady carrying documents.]

Date: Oh… Sorry about that.

Young Lady: Excuse me if I’m wrong, but… Aren’t you Detective Date?

Date: Huh? Yeah, why?

Young Lady: Oh wow, I knew it! I’m a huge fan of yours!

Date: Fan? How the heck?

Young Lady: A year ago, you ignored orders to follow your own lead. You’re the one who busted Jingu’s money-laundering scheme! People still talk about the legendary Detective Date!

Date: Hey, hold on! I wasn’t the one who solved that case. Besides, I’m not even a detective anymore.

Young Lady: I know! After the incident, you quit the force. I heard you threw your badge at the chief then popped him one right in the face!

Date: (сonfused) Oh, come on with this…

Voice: The legendary detective…

Date: Hm?

[A detective from the beginning of the game appears.]

Detective: A cop buddied up with a Kamurocho yakuza… Made you famous, huh?

Young Lady: Oh… Inspector Kawara…

Kawara: Miss, I might suggest you choose your role models more carefully. You’ll go a lot further here if you learn from somebody with some discipline, right?

[Young girl leaves.]

Date: Killer Kawara… What brings you here?

Kawara: Hadn’t you heard? I’m a detective with Foreign Affairs now.

Date: A guy who put that many holes in people in Foreign Affairs? Sounds like a bad joke.

Kawara: You make me sound like a monster. Besides, it’s been years…

Date: Yeah well, I still remember it like it was yesterday.

Kawara: Was watching some scumbags take a bullet really all that traumatic?

Date: Maybe. Not that it really matters now. I don’t figure we’ll ever cross paths again.

[He walks away but Kawara grabs his shoulder.]

Kawara: Wait a sec. I hate to disappoint, but…

Date: Huh?

Kawara: Sudo called you here, right? He’s waiting for us. Follow me.

[They walk together.]

Date: Floor B3… Kind of an odd path to take, isn’t it?

Kawara: Nervous?

Date: Yeah, maybe. Nothing but bad rumors float up from this place.

Kawara: Third floor basement, archive room 13…. The "forbidden room" of Tokyo PD.

Date: Yeah. Also known as the "scandal graveyard."

[Kawara enters a code near the door and they enter the room. There’s Sudo and some other guy sitting at a table.]

Date: Hey. Here he is.

Sudo: Date-san… I’m sorry to drag you down here.

Date: Right…

Sudo: I’ll introduce you. This is Superintendent Kurahashi, chief of Foreign Affairs Division Two.

[WATARU KURAHASHI. Tokyo Metropolitan Police Chief Division Two: Foreign Affairs.]

Kurahashi: I’ve heard the stories, Date-san. I’m Kurahashi.

Date: Foreign Affairs Division Two? What’s Asian Affairs doing down here?

Sudo: As I told you yesterday, Division Four is monitoring the Omi Alliance activity.

Date: Yeah… the Terada murder, right?

Sudo: Yes. We suspect some foreign influence… A Chinese or Korean group may be involved.

Date: You mean a foreign mafia?

Kurahashi: Actually… Division Two has been monitoring Asian mafia activity for about a year now. We’re picking up chatter about some big shifts lately. It only confirmed our suspicions… And we expected something big to go down.

Date: You did?

Sudo: I’d been monitoring Kamurocho for weeks ’on secret orders from Chief Kurahashi. Sure enough…

Date: A bomb goes off.

Sudo: Precisely. We were right all along.

Date: But… What does all that have to do with you in Division Four?

[Sudo puts a photo of Ryuji Goda on the table.]

Sudo: Second patriarch of the Omi Alliance’s Go-Ryu Clan. A man named Ryuji Goda.

Date: Ryuji Goda…

Sudo: An Omi higher-up we suspect led the Terada hit.

Date: Okay, what about him?

Sudo: Our intelligence picked up a conversation Goda had, conspiring with the bomber.

[Kurahashi takes out a tape recorder and turns it on.]

Tape Recorder (Ryuji): But just so we’re clear, I ain’t one of your boys. Seein’ Kamurocho go up in a sea of flames… That’s the common goal here. Once this job’s over, we’re strangers. Ya got that?

Man: Sure. You just enjoy the show.

Sudo: The man with the Kansai accent is probably Ryuji Goda.

Date: I get it. So now Divisions Two and Four are trying to figure out who the other guy is.

Kurahashi: Right again. First we have to ID this guy.

[We see a diagram on the table with different signatures. Above Ryuji’s picture is written 郎田龍司 (Goda Ryuji) and below the photo (近江連合) (Omi Alliance).It connected to 海外組織 (Overseas Organization). Above the recorder it says <電話> (Phone). The place where Kurahashi points is marked with a circle.]

Kurahashi: Using that, we hope to uncover the organization connected to the Omi.

Date: You have a location?

Kurahashi: We tried eliminating all the line noise, but we still can’t pinpoint the location.

Date: So… What’s all this about a case only I can handle?

Kurahashi: You see, Date-san… We need you to get close to this man.

[He places a photo of some guy on the table.]

Date: Hm? That’s..

Kurahashi: Yes… Someone you know very well, Date-san. Owner of the Kamurocho host club, Stardust. Alias, "Kazuki."

Date: Why Kazuki?

Sudo: Six months ago Ryuji Goda came to Kamurocho, just once. The man he met with was Kazuki.

Date: How is that enough to—

Kurahashi: That’s not all. He has another nameen A real name, aside from "Kazuki."

Date: Another name?

Kurahashi: Jinwu Kang. He’s a bonafide Korean.

Sudo: We’d like you to approach him subtly and apply a little pressure. Is he Korean mafia or not?

Kurahashi: That’s what we need you to find out. After last year’s events, he trusts you implicitly. You’re the only man for this job, Date-san.

[Next scene. Kaoru drives with cuffed Kiryu.]

Where are you taking me? Hey, you listening?

[Kaoru pulls off.]

Kaoru: We should be safe this far out.

Kiryu: What do you mean by that?

Kaoru: The assault charge was just a cover.

[She uncuffs Kiryu.]

Kaoru: I was asked to take you into protective custody.

Kiryu: Protective custody?

Kaoru: Try to give me the slip, and I’ll arrest you for real.

[Kiryu notices a sniper on a nearby roof and tries to cover Kaoru.]

Kiryu: Get down!

[The sniper disappears after 2 shots.]

Kiryu: Where were you hit?

Kaoru: I-It’s nothing…

Kiryu: The bullet’s still in there… This is gonna get bad. Hey, where’s the nearest hospital?

Kaoru: Sotenbori…

Kiryu: What?

Kaoru: In Sotenbori… Find a… bar called Aoi…

[She loses consciousness.]

Kiryu: (The bar was called Aoi. I better find it fast.)

Find Aoi
[He runs through the city.]

Kiryu: (This must be the place she wanted me to find.)

[He walk in the place called スナック葵 (Snack Bar Aoi). Aoi means hollyhock. On the second sign we can read 呑み処 (drinking place or a pub) and 食い処 (eating place or a canteen). It’s a tavern! Some woman, presumably a bartender, smoking and sweeping the floor.]

Bartender: Who the hell are you?

Kiryu: I’m Kiryu, but I—

Bartender: It’s like a different thug every week… Send all ya like. I can’t pay what I can’t pay!

Kiryu: What?

Bartender: It’s protection money yer after, yeah?

Kiryu: Do you know a woman named Kaoru Sayama?

Bartender: Kaoru? What of her?

Kiryu: She’s hurt.

Bartender: Where is she!?

Kiryu: I left her in the car.

Bartender: Then haul your ass back and get her!

[Kiryu runs to the car.]

Kiryu: (She’s hurt worse than I thought! If I don’t hurry…!)

[Kiryu brings Kaoru to the tavern.]

Kiryu: Where do you want her?

Tamiyo: Here, lay her down!

[We sneakily learn the bartender’s name through subtitles. Kiryu leaves the tavern.]

Kiryu: (I’m sure rd just be in the way in there. I’ll check back in a few.)

[Daigo calls him.]

Daigo: Hey, it’s Daigo.

Kiryu: How are things on your end?

Daigo: We’re okay for now. Chairman Coda’s with We’re heading toward Kamurocho by car.

Kiryu: Good. How are you holding up, though?

Daigo: I’ll make it. I’m not built like a truck like you, but I can still take a punch.   

Kiryu: Heh, good to know. This alliance is in your hands right now.

Daigo: Yeah, I know. Later, then.

[Kiryu takes a bit of time to rest and then he gets a call from Tamiyo.]

Tamiyo: It’s me, from Aoi.

Kiryu: Oh, hi. How’s she doing?

Tamiyo: Calmed down. finally. Medicine’s doin’ job now so she’s nappin’.   

Kiryu: That’s good.

Tamiyo: Anyhow. sorry to bother ya, but do ya think ya could pick up some more bandages, sugar? I’m out, and if this thing opens up again…

Kiryu: Yeah, no problem. I’ll pick some up on my way back.

Tamiyo: You’re a doll. Talk to ya soon.

[Kiryu buys bandages and returns to Aoi. There are various household chemicals on the table - the operation was clearly carried out in an improvised manner. Kaoru is asleep on the couch.]

Kiryu: (to Tamiyo) You ever work at a hospital? You know what you’re doing.

Tamiyo: Yeah, way back.

Kiryu: I figured. You and Sayama must be close.

Tamiyo: Close? That’s an understatement! I’m her ma, sugar.

Kiryu: What?

Tamiyo: I mean, not by blood or nothin’… But a ma’s a ma.

Kiryu: So you’re her foster mother?

Tamiyo: Close, but I’m just the ma who raised her. Kiddo’s an orphan.

Kiryu: An orphan…

Tamiyo: Her folks died not long after she was born So I took her in.

Kiryu: I see… That explains it.

Tamiyo: Explains what now?

Kiryu: When she was shot, she told me to find a bar called Aoi…

Tamiyo: Yeah… And?

Kiryu: A bar’s not exactly the first place people throw out in that situation. They’d start with "my mom" or "my dad."

Tamiyo: Hmm… Ya think? What makes ya so sure?

Kiryu: I’m an orphan, too.

Tamiyo: Oh yeah? Well, it’s true enough I ain’t Kaoru’s real ma.

Kiryu: Sorry… Did I offend you?

Tamiyo: Nah, don’t sweat it! I ain’t the type to get huffy bout that stuff.

Kiryu: Yeah?

Tamiyo: So anyway, are ya a coworker of Kaoru’s? Or maybe… a private eye?

Kiryu: No… Nothing that respectable.

Tamiyo: Eh? What then?

Kiryu: Well… Sort of the opposite of the police…

Tamiyo: What?

Kaoru: Mama… That’s probʻly enough chitchat.

Kiryu: Does it hurt much?

Kaoru: You got no reason to worry ’bout me.

Tamiyo: Honey, that’s cold. He carried ya all the way here. How bout some gratitude?

Kaoru: I ain’t so far gone to be sayin’ thanks to a yakuza.

Tamiyo: Some days, hon, I—

Kiryu: It’s okay. If she’s got that much fire in her, she’ll be fine. Still, I’m surprised Ryuji Goda was able to put a hit out that quickly.

Kaoru: (holds a bullet) This… This isn’t Ryuji Goda’s style.

Kiryu: What?

Kaoru: The Go-Ryu Clan muscles their way straight at their enemies and puts them down. Simple and to the point. They wouldn’t bother with the complexities of hiring a professional sniper.

Kiryu: That was a pro?

Kaoru: You think guys who can handle a rifle from that distance grow on trees? Plus, this bullet…

Kiryu: What about it?

Kaoru: Compared to a standard rifle round, it’s way smaller. It’s possible he wasn’t shooting to kill.

Kiryu: So, what… They wanted to intimidate me?

Kaoru: That, I don’t know. We’d have to ask the guy who shot me… Where are you going?

Kiryu: To find who put out the hit. As it stands now… I don’t even know who I’m fighting.

Kaoru: In that case… Take this to the mahjong parlor in Shofukucho.

[He hands Kiryu the bullet.]

Kiryu: An info dealer?

Kaoru: Look for the guy in the padded vest at a table with three people. You ask, "What’s the rate?" Then he’ll ask what you usually play for. You reply with, "It’s your call."

Kiryu: "It’s your call"…?

Kaoru: Right. Then he’ll give you a crazy rate. Accept it.

Kiryu: All right.

Kaoru: One more thing. Let me remind you… The Osaka Prefectural Police are watching. Don’t even think about skipping town. I put out the call, and your ass goes to jail. We clear?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Meet With The Information Dealer
[Kiryu finds the mahjong parlor.]

Staff: Excuse me!? Tonight’s an invite-only tournament. Can’t let folks without invitations just waltz in.

Mahjong Lover: Brushed off at the mahjong parlor, right? Askin’ fer invitations and all, thinkin’ they’re all big shots or somethin’. What, ya gotta be as good as Jongka just to get into the place now?

Kiryu: Sorry, Jongka?

Mahjong Lover: Any mahjong player worth his salt would bout piss his pants at hearin’ the man’s name! So the three top dogs in underground mahjong were Jongka, Jongko, and Jongen. But Jongka up n’ quit mahjong, and now he just wastes away at an arcade… Got addicted to them UFO catcher machines. Kinda sad story.

[Kiryu walks into the nearest arcade and finds an elderly man in a hat.]

Kiryu: Are you Longka?

Longka: Hey, buddy. Think ya could snag me one of them prizes? See them kitty cats? I got my eye on the red one.

I’m kinda busy here.
Sure, sounds good. +

Kiryu: I can try, but then we’ve gotta talk.

Longka: Yeah? Thanks, buddy.

[Kiryu snags the toy - Kitty Cat (Red).]

Longka: Whoa! Nice job, buddy! Aww, Yukiko’ll love this! Y-Yukiko…

Kiryu: So you are Jongka, aren’t you?

Longka: There was a time when I went by that name… But I gave up the game.

Kiryu: Why’d you stop?

Longka: Wouldn’t have, if those dirty yakuza hadn’t cheated me! Bastards forced me into debt! I was doing okay running away from ‘em… But now the sons of bitches have my little girl, Yukiko. They’re tellin’ me if I ever want to see her again, I’ve gotta give ‘em five million yen… Say! Ya wouldn’t happen to have five million I could have, would ya!? Not exactly a thing ya up and ask a guy, is it?

Kiryu: I’m sorry, but all I’m really after is an invitation to Riichi Towers.

Longka: Riichi Towers? Ya mean ya need a cherry blossom tile? See, it’s a special tile they made to act kinda like a membership card. Tell ya what, you get my baby girl back, and this tile’s all yours. Ya look like you can handle a tough crowd… Am I right?

Kiryu: …When I have to. But fine, I’ll help you.

Longka: You will!? No shit!? Well, ya know those coin lockers across Bishamon Bridge? There’s a guy waitin’ by those. He’s expectin’ five million yen, but… I’m sure ya can figure it out. Don’t you let ‘em hurt my sweet Yukiko though…

[Kiryu runs to the coin lockers.]

Yakuza: Huh!? Who the fuck are you!?

Kiryu: Let’s just say Jongka sent me.

Yakuza: What the fuck happened to him? You got the money?

Kiryu: The last thing you’re getting from me is money.

Yakuza: Gaah ha ha! What a joke. Here’s how we deal with guys who fuck around!

[Kiryu kicks their asses.]

Yakuza: Mercy! Mercy, man! Look, the girl, she’s.

She’s by the river, near the umbrella. The guy in red clothes has her. …Yawowowow!

[The yakuzas run away. Kiryu finds the man in red.]

Man in Red: Hey! Help me out here, man! Take this damn cat off my hands! Givin’ this devil cat a pretty girl’s name like Yukiko… The fuzzbag nearly scratched my face off!

Kiryu: You’re telling me Yukiko is a cat?

[He takes the cat to Jongka.]

Longka: Ah! Yukiko! You poor thing! Thank god you’re safe!

Kiryu: …….

Longka: Well, here’s the cherry blossom tile. Deal’s a deal. And you can have this too. It’s a mahjong strategy guide that might help ya out. I wrote it myself, actually.

[Kiryu goes back to Riichi Towers.]

Staff: Excuse me!? Tonight’s an invite-only tournament. Can’t let folks without invitations just waltz in.

Kiryu: And what if I have one of these?

Staff: Oh, how’d ya come across that? Not that it matters. Come on in.

[Kiryu enters the tournament.]

Kiryu: (I need to find the man in a padded vest… …Him?) Hey, what’s your rate?

Esaki: How much ya usually play for?

5,000 yen
10,000 yen
It’s your call. +

Kiryu: It’s your call.

Esaki: 40 million yen. Win, and you could fuckin’ buy Osaka Castle.

{40 million yen is about $335,000}

Kiryu: Fine by me.

Esaki: …So whaddaya wanna know?

Kiryu: What can you tell me about this bullet? I need to know where it came from.

Esaki: 100 grand… Take it or leave it.

{100 grand equvalent $840}

Kiryu: I don’t have that kind of cash. I’ll be back when I do.

[Kiryu collects the required amount of money and returns to the mahjong parlor.]

Esaki: That info’s gonna run ya 100 grand. Ya got the cash?   

[Kiryu pays.]

Esaki: (holding the bullet) This here’s Omi. Takashima Family.

Kiryu: Takashima…?

[Kiryu recalls meeting Takashima at the Omi Alliance building.]

Takashima: (from Kiryu’s memory) Yes, Terada – No, the Tojo Clan’s fifth chairman was my sworn brother.

Esaki: That’s right… Bullet like this? The only guns that use ’em are smuggled in from the mainland. And the guy who’s got that market cornered in Kansai… is Takashima.

Kiryu: Any chance Takashima is reselling them?

Esaki: Nope. Takashima ain’t big on risk, and that’s a rickety bridge. Any trails would lead right back to him. Only reason ya smuggle in guns is ’cause it’s cheaper that way.

Kiryu: So if this is common knowledge, why haven’t the police taken action?

Esaki: Beats me… I don’t ask questions. But…

Kiryu: But…?

Esaki: Uh-oh, ’fraid not. Me n’ my big mouth. I’ve told ya all I’m gonna tell ya…

Kiryu: Why would Takashima…?

[Meanwhile Takashima talks to the sniper on the phone.]

Takashima: So, it went according to plan?

Sniper: Yes. A non-fatal wound, just like you asked, boss.

Takashima: And the bullet?

Sniper: Also like you asked. Unless this Kiryu guy’s a moron, we’re fine. He’ll trace the hit right to us from the bullet in the car.

Takashima: Good.

Sniper: But, can I ask why, sir?

Takashima: Because now he knows he can’t trust anyone… And that’s enough for now.

Sniper: Understood, boss. So… What do we do next?

Takashima: Stand by. Let’s let him float for a while. We have plenty of time.

Sniper: Understood. Bye then.

[When the camera moves behind the door of the room where Takashima is, you can see that he is in 取調室 (Interrogation Room). Chief Tsutomu enters.]

Tsutomu: You really talkin’ on the phone in here? This interrogation a joke to you!?

Takashima: It was just a business call. I’m a busy man.

Tsutomu: Oh yeah, a real yakuza hotshot! We know all about the shit you’re floatin’ upstream! Word is, you’re headin’ up a rifle smugglin’ operation?

Takashima: This is all voluntary at this point, yes? I’m under no obligation to answer you. Besides, aren’t you getting off topic?

Tsutomu: Not really?

Takashima: We’re the victims here. If you’re going to make arrests, shouldn’t it be Kazuma Kiryu?

Tsutomu: Your buddies didn’t seem to think so. Aren’t you people on Kiryu’s side here?

Takashima: How absurd… Again, the Omi are victims. Why don’t you just have your little lady cop arrest him? That’s simple enough, right?

Tsutomu: How’d you know ’bout Sayama?

Takashima: It doesn’t matter. By the way, Bessho-san. Have you heard anything from your superintendent yet?

Tsutomu: Yeah, sure did! Told me to send ya on yer merry way. You can go. Move along now.

Takashima: Can I now? Very well.

[He walks to the door.]

Tsutomu: Takashima! Whatever the hell you’re playing at… I don’t care who ya know up top around here. But you join up with those Go-Ryu fucks, and I’ll bust your wrinkly ass. We clear on that?

Takashima: Bessho-san… That police versus yakuza mentality? It’s a thing of the past.

[He leaves the interrogation room. Kiryu continue too talk to Esaki.]

Kiryu: There’s something else I want to know.

Esaki: What’s that?

Kiryu: The rest of the story… What’s Takashima really up to?

Esaki: That’s extra… Think ya can afford it?

Kiryu: How much?

Esaki: 300 grand. Can’t make it a lick cheaper. Time to hit the bank, buddy.

Kiryu: (I’m not paying that. Maybe Kurokawa can help me out on this one.)

[Kiryu finds Kurokawa on the streets.]

Kurokawa: Yo, Kiryu-han! How’s it hangin’?

Kiryu: I’m having a problem with an information dealer named Esaki. Ever heard of him?   

Kurokawa: Esaki? Ehhh, you fallin’ in with bad crowds now, Kiryu-han? The guy looked me up once, though… Askin’ about the price of “almonds." Dunno what “almonds” are, myself, and that’s how I suggest ya keep it, ’cause rm sure it ain’t pretty. Oh yeah! Y’know somethin’? I forget where, but I recall a local barkeep talkin’ about almonds too… Sketchy bastard. Somethin’ about 100 grand, 200 grand a pop… Too rich for my blood!    Maybe the bartender could give ya the scoop if ya manage to track him down.

Kiryu: Maybe I will. Thanks.

[Kiryu runs to Stijl to talk to the bartender. It’s quite a classy place.]

Bartender: Welcome. sir.

Kiryu: Hey, I’ve heard you’re the guy to ask about “almonds.”

Bartender: Hmm? Perhaps I am. Interested?

Kiryu: Maybe. But what would that run me?

Bartender: 100,000 yen, sir.

Kiryu: Pricey, aren’t they? But good to know.

Bartender: Do I have your interest, sir? I’d need you to pay up front.

Kiryu: No, I think I’m all right. Thanks for the tip.

[Having the information Kiryu returns to the mahjong parlor.]

Kiryu: I’ve heard you’re a big player in the almond market. Is that something you’d like to discuss?

Esaki: Hey, that’s… Fine. Let’s drop that and call this a fair trade, eh? Takashima’s a Touto U grad with connections to all sortsa government officials. But his loyalty to the Omi Alliance’s fifth chairman is what got him to where he is today… Now he’s top Of the food chain. Can’t remember a time when he wasn’t an officer.

[Esaki’s phone ringing.]

Esaki: Eh? Ya serious? Gotchya.

Kiryu: Thanks for your help.

Esaki: Hey, just a sec now… Kazuma Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: How do you know my name?

Esaki: Buddy… Ya just turned into 100 million yen!

Kiryu: What the hell?

Esaki: It’s a bounty man. Nothin’ personal. Put 100 mil on a guy’s head, who wouldn’t jump at it?

Kiryu: 100 million… A little on the cheap side, no?

Esaki: True, considerin’ this is a Tojo ex-chairman we’re talkin’ here… But it’s a helluva payday for us. ’Fraid you’ve gotta die now!

[Kiryu forced to defend himself, but he went a little overboard and covered the floor with battered mahjong players.]

Kiryu: Who put the bounty on my head!?

Esaki: Who knows?

[Kiryu bangs his head against the table so that the mahjong chips stick to his face.]

Esaki: S-Stop! Th-The Sengoku Family!

Kiryu: This the Sengoku I think it is?

Esaki: E-Exactly!

[Kiryu recalls the cocky man with the fan he saw at the meeting with Goda.]

Toranosuke: (in Kiryu’s memory) What? Handle this however ya damn please. If ya need money to cover Terada’s incense, just lemme know, yeah?

Esaki: Goda, Takashima, and Sengoku are on your ass. You’re outta options, buddy.

Kiryu: Why put a price on me?

Esaki: You’re the finish line at the end of their race….

Kiryu: Me?

[Meanwhile, in Sengoku’s office…]

Sengoku Thug: (on the phone) Got it… So Kiryu walked outta the mahjong parlor in one piece? …Alright. (hungs up) (to Toranosuke) Waste o’ time, hittin’ up that lady cop’s stool pigeon and buyin’ out those broke-ass info dealers…

Toranosuke: Guess an amateur couldn’t hack it against Kiryu.

Sengoku Thug: So, what’s our next move?

Toranosuke: We chill out let ’im take in Osaka for a bit.

Sengoku Thug: But boss, what if the Go-Ryu boys get to him first?

Toranosuke: What can that man-baby actually do? Kid’ll probably pick a fight head-on and land his sorry ass in jail. Meanwhile, Kiryu’s gonna hightail it back to Kamurocho. If n’ when he does, brat-boy’s gonna give chase… So before that…

[Two thugs bring a large box full of money.]

Toranosuke: Here’s a cool bil. Make it rain in Kamurocho.

Sengoku Thug: You got it, boss.

[Back to Kiryu.]

Kiryu: (I should be getting back to Aoi.)

[He meets two strange man on the way.]

Man 1: Four Shine is practically a trash heap. What if we were to offer you a position with us?

Kiryu: Hm?

Man 2: O-Oh, but… They made an offer, and I already accepted it…

Man 1: In that case, I’m prepared to pay double what Four Shine offered. How does that sound?

Man 2: What!? Double!? Sign me up! Forget Four Shine, I’m your man!

Man 1: That’s excellent enthusiasm. I look forward to working with you, Kiritani-san.

[They walk away.]

Kiryu: (Sounds like Four Shine lost a hire. It’s a shame that talent sniping is such a common issue in this business…) Hm? Four Shine? They stole that guy from right outside their club?

[While Kiryu is looking at the sign, a young girl with glasses comes running out of the club.]

Excited Girl: Aaaaah! You’re here! I’ve been waiting for you forever!

Kiryu: Hm?

Excited Girl: It’s such a blessing to have someone with your experience join the team! Thank you so much, Kiritani-san! Or should I say, Floor Manager Kiritani!

Kiryu: You’re confused, lady. The name’s Kiryu.

Excited Girl: Kiryu? I could’ve sworn it was Kiritani… Oh well! Anyway, come on inside! Come, come, come!

Kiryu: Wh-Whoa…

[She pushes Kiryu into the club.]

Excited Girl: Koyuki-chan! Our new manager’s here!

Koyuki: We’ve been waiting for you, Kiritani-san! …Huh?

Excited Girl: What’s the matter, Koyuki-chan?

Koyuki: This guy looks pretty different than the picture on his file…

Excited Girl: Maybe he’s just not very photogenic? He could be sensitive about that, you know!? If you wanna get to the top of the hostess biz, you can’t just blurt that kinda stuff out!

Koyuki: Yeah but… The difference is like night and day here… Any chance you grabbed the wrong guy?

Excited Girl: The wrong guy!? Koyuki-chan, don’t even go there… (looking at Kiryu) Hmm? Hmmmm…? Hmmmmmmmmmm!? He’s the wrong guy!

Koyuki: That’s what I just said!

Kiryu: (What the hell is happening right now…)

Excited Girl: I can’t apologize enough for this, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: Don’t worry about it. You’re the… owner, I take it?

Excited Girl: Yes, apologies for the late introduction. I’m the owner of Club Four Shine, Yuki. And this is our number one girl, Koyuki-chan.

Koyuki: Nice to meet you! I’m Koyuki.

Kiryu: Oh, number one, huh? That’s pretty amazing.

Koyuki: Thank you very much… We say number one, but.. We only have three girls working here…

Kiryu: Just three?

Yuki: And I double as the owner and staff… We haven’t been able to open the doors here for a while due to the shortage… We were struggling to hire new staff, but then we got lucky with Kiritani-san.

Koyuki: Speaking of Kiritani-san, he’s running awfully late…

Kiryu: Yeah, about Kiritani… I don’t think you should count on him showing up.

Yuki: Huh?

Kiryu: I just saw him get bought out by some other guy in a suit. He offered him double whatever Four Shine could pay him…

Yuki: N-No way…

Koyuki: What do we do? We already spent a ton of money advertising that we’d be re-opening to get customers in…

Yuki: Not good… We’ll take a huge loss if we can’t open, not to mention our reputation taking a nose dive… Ahh, what do we do!? If only we had one more person on staff to help us out…

Koyuki: Hm?

Yuki: Hm?

Kiryu: ……

Yuki & Koyuki: …Hmmmmm?

Kiryu: ……

Yuki & Koyuki: …Hmmmmmmmm!?

Kiryu: I’m not doing it!

Yuki: Won’t you please reconsider!? If we don’t open tonight, our club’s dead in the water! We’ll even pay you a full day’s salary… Won’t you please do it!?

Kiryu: Easy to say… But you know I’ve never been a cabaret club manager, right?

Yuki: You’ll be fine! Our club is very welcoming to beginners!

Koyuki: And you’ll have our full support, too!

Kiryu: Still…

Yuki: Please, Kiryu-san. Opening our doors is so important to our customers today… I can’t imagine betraying all the customers who’ve been looking forward to this….

Kiryu: ……

Yuki: I’m know we’re asking the impossible… But, please!

Koyuki: Please!

Kiryu: I guess I’m in… But just this once.

Yuki: Yes!? You’ll do it!?

Kiryu: Yeah, but I’m totally green at this. Don’t get your hopes up, okay?

Yuki: Kiryu-san… Thank you so much!

Koyuki: Yuki-san! We’ve gotta get ready to open!

Yuki: Right! Well, Kiryu-san… Er, Mr. Manager! I look forward to working with you!

[Kiryu greets new customers with a bow.]

Kiryu: Welcome… sir.

Girls: Welcome!

[Kiryu works a full day helping girls out.]

Girls: Thank you for coming!

Kiryu: Whew… We made it through!

Yuki: Kiryu-san, we owe you one! Was that really your first time!? You were so good!

Koyuki: I agree! Kiryu-san, you’re a natural at this!

Kiryu: Heh, don’t flatter me. But I’m impressed by the club. The customers really seem to love it here.

Yuki: Thank you!

[Man 1 with a girl in red dress suddenly enters.]

Man 1: My, my. And I was sure you’d be drowning in your sorrows, considering the loss of your manager… Are you enjoying yourselves?

Kiryu: That’s the guy who stole your hire..

Koyuki: Kanzaki-san…

Kiryu: Kanzaki?

Koyuki: He’s the chairman of the Kanzaki Group, a huge cabaret club conglomerate. And he’s been harassing us at every chance he gets…

Kanzaki: Koyuki-chan, you’re still scraping by at this heap? Wouldn’t a cutie like you fare better with us?

Koyuki: N-Not a chance!

Kanzaki: Mm, cold as ice… Well, I suppose that’s part of your charm.

Yuki: Kanzaki-kun… Why are you here? Did you come to stir up trouble again?

Kanzaki: You wound me, Yuki-san! I came today to bring you this…

[He gives her a flyer.]

Yuki: I-Is this…

Kanzaki: A flyer for the Cabaret Club Grand Prix!

Yuki: Cabaret Club Grand Prix!?

Kiryu: What is that?

Koyuki: Cabaret clubs across the nation compete in a contest of sales. It’s the event of events in this industry! The Grand Prix’s winner is practically guaranteed to sky rocket in popularity.

Kiryu: Really? I’ve never heard of it.

Koyuki: Yes, and last year’s champion… …Was the club run by Kirara-san here, the Sotenbori Sunshine. The largest club in the Kanzaki Group… …With the highest sales in Japan.

Kirara: Hi there!

Kanzaki: And under the most incredible circumstances… Four Shine has been invited to compete!

Koyuki: Whaaaaaaaaat!?

Yuki: But with the number of girls we have, Four Shine shouldn’t meet the entry requirements… What’s going on here?

Kanzaki: Well, as a former colleague, couldn’t just watch as Four Shine shut down in ignominy… So I spoke with the organizers… And I asked them to make a special exception this year. Really… You ought to be thanking me here.

Kirara: Oh don’t be coy… You just wanted to finish off Four Shine yourself, didn’t you?

Yuki: Finish us?

Kirara: With the Grand Prix drawing the strongest clubs across country… How could little old Four Shine hope to compete? A blunder there would be the doom of any club’s profits and reputation… Considering the financial woes Four Shine’s already having. Could you survive such a fall?

Yuki: No way…

Kanzaki: Woah, woah, woah, let’s not reveal our whole hand, Kirara… That’s just rude.

Yuki: Ergh…!

Kanzaki: Well… Give it your best shot, Four Shine! Take care… And see you at the tournament.

[They’re leaving. Koyuki makes an obscene gesture.]

Koyuki: Annnd choke on it!

Yuki: What now…?

Koyuki: Yuki-san, we should contact the organizers and withdraw!

Yuki: ……

Koyuki: Yuki-san?

Yuki: Koyuki-chan… We’re doing the Cabaret Club Grand Prix.

Koyuki: Huh!? B-But…

Yuki: Whether we compete or not, Four Shine’s on the brink of closing. I know our chances are slim of course… But even if it’s a tiny chance, even if we embarrass ourselves, I want to bet on us. I won’t just roll over. If we’re going to go down we may as well go down fighting, right?

Koyuki: Yuki-san…

Yuki: Besides… I still believe in us and this club. It’s small, but it puts the customer above anything else…

Koyuki: And how can a place like that lose, you know?

Kiryu: Heh.

Koyuki: You’re right! Let’s do it, Yuki-san!

Yuki: Good! Then we’re agreed that we charge into battle! Kiryu-san, you’ve got this!

Kiryu: Yeah… Wha!? Me too!?

Yuki: (begging) Oh please! You’re one of us now! And you’re a natural at this, Kiryu-san! C’mon!

Kiryu: Easy for you to say… I’ve got a lot going on, you know.

Yuki: You can help whenever you find the time! We’ll pay you and you’ll learn from it too! Please, please!

Kiryu: Geez… What a world… I’ll do it.

Koyuki: Perfect! Kiryu-san, let’s get this club climbing through the ranks of the Cabaret Club League!

Kiryu: Sure.

Yuki: Oh, I know! We finally have a new coworker, so why don’t we do the thing!? You know!?

Koyuki: Good idea!

Kiryu: What now?

[They do a dance.]

Girls: Here goes! One…! Two…! Three…! Four Shine!

[Kiryu’s face at this moment is priceless.]

Yuki: Nice! We still got it!

Koyuki: Kiryu-san, you caught that, right? You’re doing it next time too.

Kiryu: Oh… Uhhh… (quietly) Oh man… What kind of nonsense have I gotten myself into now?

[Kiryu returns to his life and goes to Aoi. As he approaches the bar door he hears the voices of Tamiyo and Kaoru. He stops to eavesdrop on them.]

Tamiyo: Ya can’t keep doin’ this to yourself!

Kaoru: This again!?

Tamiyo: Why ya gotta be so stubborn!?

Kaoru: Because you keep yer lips sealed, Mama!

Tamiyo: I’ve told ya plenty! They had nothin’ to do with the yakuza!

Kaoru: Then tell me! Who are my real parents!? This is goin’ in circles… Say what ya want, I’m following Kazuma Kiryu.

Tamiyo: But why?

Kaoru: Because he’s Tojo, that’s why.

Tamiyo: He is!?

Kaoru: With him in my custody. I can get closer to the Tajo Clan. Whatever happened.. I’ll finally be close enough to dig it up.

Tamiyo: Kaoru… Are ya really…

[Kiryu enters.]

Kiryu: How’s your arm?

Kaoru: It’s fine now.

Kiryu: Could I trouble you for some water?

[Tamiyo nods and leaves. Kaoru’s phone ringing.]

Kaoru: This is Sayama. Ah, yes. A minor injury, yes. Yeah, he’s here. Hm? Y-Yeah, sure. (to Kiryu) Chief wants to talk to you…

Kiryu: Huh? This is Kiryu.

Tsutomu: This is Bessho, Division Four. Did Sayama fill ya in on the investigation?

Kiryu: Yeah… But what do you want with me?

Tsutomu: Hope you’re sittin’ down. Yer buddy and Chairman Goda have been kidnapped by some gang.

Kiryu: What’d you say?

Tsutomu: They ran off in a blaze of machine gun fire when we chased ’em.

Kiryu: Was it the Go-Ryu Clan?

Tsutomu: Nope, they were speakin’ a foreign language. Any other guesses?

Kiryu: No…

Tsutomu: Well, what can ya do. Figured I’d throw it out there. I’m thinkin’ y’oughta book it back to Kamurocho, y’know?

Kiryu: Go back to Kamurocho? But… I can’t leave Daigo and Chairman Goda like this.

Tsutomu: Well, the plates on the getaway cars had Kamurocho numbers.

Kiryu: What!?

Kiryu: That’s all I can give ya. Protocol, y’know.

Kiryu: Right. I owe you one.

Tsutomu: Yeah? Remember, Sayama and Osaka PD have ya by the short n’ curlies.

Kiryu: I’ll remember.

Tsutomu: Later.

[He hungs up.]

Kiryu: I’m going back to Kamurocho.

Kaoru: What?

Kiryu: That’s outside Osakan jurisdiction. You don’t have to come.

Kaoru: The second they put you in my custody, jurisdiction went out the window. I’m going with you.

Kiryu: Have it your way.

Chapter 5: HIDDEN PAST
[Kiryu and Kaoru return to Kamurocho. The sign above their heads with 神室町天下一通り means “Kamurocho Tenkaichi Street”. Kaoru gets sick and falls down. Kiryu catches her.]

Kiryu: What’s wrong?

Kaoru: I’m fine. Just a little light-headed…

Kiryu: (touches her forehead) I’d say you’re still running a fever.

Kaoru: And I said I’m fine. Drop it! Put me down! This is embarrassing!

Kiryu: You’ll live. We’re not going far anyway.

[He brings her to some long abandoned place…]

Kaoru: Where are we?

Kiryu: Just a bar I used to unwind at.

Kaoru: Oh.

Kiryu: You shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard yet.

Kaoru: I’ll be fine after a little rest.

Kiryu: (turns on the light) The place is closed up, but the lights still work… Yeah, glad to hear your voice, Kashiwagi-san.

[Ironically, as he speaks, Kashiwagi calls him.]

Kashiwagi: This is Kashiwagi. Kiryu, are you all right?

Kiryu: Yeah, glad to hear your voice, Kashiwagi-san.

Kashiwagi: Where are you now?

Kiryu: I just got back to Kamurocho.

Kashiwagi: I’m getting some crazy reports out of Kansai. What the hell happened down there?

Kiryu: Chairman Goda and Daigo were abducted. And I don’t know who’s behind it yet. I’ll head down to Tojo HQ to fill you in.

Kashiwagi: Good plan. I’ll round up the officers. They’ll want to hear this.

Kiryu: (Guess it’s time to catch a cab.)

[On the way to cabs Kiryu got a call.]

Kiryu: This is Kiryu.

Daigo: Kiryu-san… It’s Daigo.

Kiryu: Daigo! Are you all right!?

Daigo: Yeah, I’m—

Unknown voice: Is this Kazuma Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Who the hell are you!?

Unknown voice: You’ll find out soon enough. If you want Daigo Dojima to live… Meet me at 1 A.M. tomorrow night at the Amano Building.

Kiryu: The Amano Building? What about Chairman Goda? Is he alive?

Unknown voice: You’ll find out soon enough. Oh, and be sure to come alone.

Kiryu: Fine.

Unknown voice: See you.

(Tomorrow, 1 A.M., the Amano Building… The Tojo Clan officers will want to hear this. I better catch a cab.)

Taxi Driver: The base fare is 660 yen. Where would you like to go? Very well. Let’s be on our way.

[Kiryu arrives at Tojo HQ meeting.]

Kashiwagi: The Go-Ryu Clan staged a coup!?

Kiryu: Ryuji Goda… He wants an all-out war between Kansai and Kanto at any cost.

Kashiwagi: Then have you figured out who the foreigners behind the kidnapping are?

Kiryu: Not yet…

Yayoi: And the man who took Daigo told you to come to the Amano Building alone at 1:00 tonight?

Kiryu: Right.

Yayoi: This is a trap.

Kiryu: I know. But if I don’t go, we’ll never know who we’re dealing with here.

Yayoi: Maybe so, but still…

Kashiwagi: You think the foreigners are tied to the Go-Ryu Clan behind the scenes?

Kiryu: No doubt they are. I can’t think of anyone else who would take Daigo and Chairman Goda.

Kashiwagi: It’s probably the same foreign group responsible for bombing my office…

Yayoi: If so, they know their way around Kamurocho. Which means going in alone is even more dangerous. Shindo! The Amano Building is your territory, right? Give Kiryu some backup here. Keep your distance, but be ready.

Shindo: I don’t think so.

[KOJI SHINDO. Patriarch of the Nishikiyama Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

Kashiwagi: (stands from his chair) What was that!?

Shindo: My boys are still sore from what Kiryu here did to the family. Considering that…

Kashiwagi: You little shit! That’s because Nishikiyama was a traitor!

Shindo: I’m well aware of that. But our respect for Patriarch Nishikiyama led us to this life. And that respect for the boss… hasn’t changed.

Yayoi: Then you’re openly defying clan orders?

Shindo: Even if it means expulsion from the Tojo Clan, that’s the one—

Kiryu: Fine then. I know better than anyone what sort of man Nishiki was. And I understand the sentiment. But… Let me ask you just one thing.

Shindo: And that is?

Kiryu: Other than your grudge against me… You’re not hiding any other objections to this, are you?

Shindo: Of course not.

Kiryu: All right… Then it’s settled.

Shindo: If you’ll excuse me.

[He bows and leaves the room. Some time later Kiryu talks with Yayoi in private.]

Yayoi: Kiryu, I have something personal I’d like to discuss with you. Can you meet me on the first floor?

Kashiwagi: If you’re sure, I’d suggest trying Purgatory, then.

Kiryu: He hangs out there?

Kashiwagi: In a manner of speaking, yes. But things have changed since last year. Better that you see for yourself. The entrance is still through that public bathroom near West Park. I never understood it, but it makes about as much sense as Purgatory does. Be careful.

Kiryu: I’ll do my best.

Go to Purgatory
[He exits the Tojo building and sees a frightened worker talking to the guards.]

Man: I got a dispatch from the company saying there’s a gas leak on the premises. I’ll need to get through here…

Tojo Clan Member 1: Well nothing’s come down to me, so I suggest you turn around!

Man: But if I ignore it I’m gonna lose my job…

Tojo Clan Member 2: What!? You dumb bastard, listen, we’re—

Man: Fine! You leave me no choice…!

[He punches Tojo Clan Member 1.]

Tojo Clan Member 1: Gergh! What the fuck are you doing!?

Tojo Clan Member 2: Hey, are you okay!?

Tojo Clan Member 1: Damn… I knew he seemed fishy!

[Kiryu runs in.]

Kiryu: (Some kind of hitman? He’s not making it past me!)

[Kiryu and the two Tojo Clan Members punches the stupidest assassin to the ground.]

Kiryu: (He must have been sent by the Omi Alliance…)

Tojo Clan Member 1: Who the fuck was he!? Not that it matters, I’m about to beat it out of him!

Tojo Clan Member 2: (bows) Thanks for your help, Fourth Chairman.

Kiryu: It’s fine. The Tojo Clan is going to be assaulted from every angle now, so you’ve gotta stay sharp. Keep security tight, too.

Tojo Clan Member 1: Yes, sir!

Kiryu: (I should get back to Kamurocho now.)

[When Kiryu arrives in Kamurocho by cab, Kaoru calls him.]

Kiryu: Sayama? What’s up?

Kaoru: What’s up!? Oh, I’ll tell you what’s up… You don’t really get the position you’re in, do you? Disappear like that again, and I’ll—

Kiryu: You were unconscious. Was I supposed to watch you sleep?

Kaoru: …Whatever. Let’s just say you’ve used your get outta jail free card. Anyway, where are you?

Kaoru: Out in Kamurocho.

Kaoru: Oh, perfect. Can you do me a favor?

Kiryu: I guess?

Kaoru: Can you pick up a few things for me?

Kiryu: You want me to shop for you?

Kaoru: Listen, let’s not make this any more awkward than it has to be. I need some underwear.

Kiryu: W-Wait, what? Is this a joke?

Kaoru: Look, I didn’t know I’d be staying in Kamurocho like this.

Kiryu: You were the one that came along…

Kaoru: And while you’re out, I could really use a beer.

Kiryu: Seriously…?

Kaoru: Underwear and beer! It’s two things! Can you manage that?

Kiryu: Listen. I’m not your personal—

Kaoru: Oh, sorry, what? You’re breaking up! Thanks, see ya soon!

[Kiryu buys what Kaoru asked for and returns to his old bar.]

Kiryu: Hello? Where are you? Where’d she go?

[Kaoru walks out of the shower. She’s wrapped in a towel.]

Kaoru: Ah, that felt good. I was so sweaty and gross, I figured I’d hit a sauna or something… But the place next door had a shower, so I just helped myself.

Kiryu: (turns around) So I see.

Kaoru: I’m guessing the place used to be a brothel? I’ve never seen so many showers all crammed together like that. In Kansai, we’d have busted them in a heartbeat.

Kiryu: Are you feeling better then?

Kaoru: Yeah, my fever finally broke. My shoulder’s almost good as new too. I feel like I’m ready for action again.

[Kaoru drops the towel.]

Kiryu: Yeah, well… You should still take it easy.

Kaoru: Thanks for picking stuff up.

[Kiryu lights a cigarette.]

Kiryu: Hey…

Kaoru: Hm?

Kiryu: I know you only followed me here to dig up some Tojo Clan history.

Kaoru: (in Kiryu’s memory) With him in my custody, I can get closer to the Tojo Clan. Whatever happened… I’ll finally be close enough to dig it up.

Kiryu: I didn’t mean to eavesdrop.

[Kaoru opens a can of beer and has a few sips.]

Kaoru: If you knew that… Why’d you let me follow you to Kamurocho?

Kiryu: Because it’s a Tojo Clan issue.

Kaoru: And you’re curious?

Kiryu: A little. Will you tell me?

Kaoru: It’s just like Mama said… I grew up without knowing my real parents. I was told they got sick and passed when I still a baby… But I could tell Mama was hiding something. Then one day I heard Mama shouting on the phone.

Kiryu: What’d you overhear?

Kaoru: "The Tojo Clan’s what made Kaoru’s life a livin’ hell."

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan’s responsible?

Kaoru: I’m sure she was talking to someone who knows my past. That was 10 years back. I’ve asked her a thousand times, but she’ll never tell me. She’d always just say. "Knowing won’t make you any happier."

Kiryu: You’re sure it’s not a misunderstanding?

Kaoru: I can read Mama like a book… And she’s hiding something. But it was killing me to keep hounding her. So I joined the force hoping to find out for myself.

Kiryu: You think the Tojo Clan killed your parents?

Kaoru: After all these secrets, isn’t that the natural conclusion?

Kiryu: Now it’s making sense. You used "protective custody" as a cover to get close to me…

Kaoru: Some cop I am if you can read me that easy, huh?

Kiryu: It’s not like I can’t sympathize.

Kaoru: Huh?

Kiryu: I had one too… A secret, I mean.

Kaoru: Something in your past?

Kiryu: Yeah… But when I learned the truth, it only brought me pain. I still wish I’d never found out. Isn’t it possible… that some secrets are better off kept that way?

Kaoru: Spoken like a man who knows his past.

Kiryu: I guess that’s fair.

[Some time later.]

Kiryu: Hey, I’ve got somewhere I need to go.

Kaoru: Oh yeah? Where?

Kiryu: The place is called Purgatory.

Kaoru: Purgatory? Sounds cheery. Where is it?

Kiryu: Well, the entrance is disguised as a bathroom near a park.

Kaoru: Really… And just what are we gonna find in this “Purgatory?”

Kiryu: It’s a little corner of the underworld. You never really know.

Kaoru: I’m not sure I follow, but I’m coming all the same. Let’s move.

Go to Purgatory
[They go to the bathroom near the park. A man meets them there.]

Tamura: Oh, Kiryu-san! It’s been forever!

Kiryu: Hey, Tamura. How goes the info business? Haven’t talked to you in a while.

Tamura: Yeah, same old, same old! What have you been up to, though? I haven’t seen you around.

Kiryu: Yeah, I don’t live here anymore.

Tamura: That would explain it. Well, if you ever need info, you know I’m your man. I’ll cut you a good deal. I still hang around the theater if you need me. Hope to see you around!

[Kiryu enters the bathroom. Kaoru looks a bit worried.]

Kaoru: Hold up! This is a men’s room…

Kiryu: Don’t worry, you won’t see anything. Stay close, now.

[Kiryu enters the booth.]

Kaoru: This is the place?

Kiryu: I was just as surprised the first time.

[When they enter the Purgatory itself, Kiryu notices that construction is going on everywhere. A rather dirty park with tents of homeless people is being transformed into a well-kept residential area.]

Kiryu: This was a different place a year back.

Kaoru: What was it like before?

Kiryu: It was a homeless encampment.

Kaoru: Looks like they’re renovating.

Kiryu: Yeah.

[A muscular black guy approaches Kiryu. If I remember correctly his name is Gary "Buster" Holmes and he was one of underworld fighters. He’s a construction worker now.]

Gary: It has been a long time, Kiryu-san. Boss is waiting in the back downstairs. Go ahead.

[Kiryu and Kaoru enter the underground city of sin. It doesn’t change much since the previous game - it’s still a traditional Japanese Red Light District.]

Hooker: Come play with me!

Kaoru: There’s a whole city under here…

Kiryu: You haven’t seen anything yet.

Kaoru: What IS this place!?

Kiryu: Probably better not to ask questions. Just follow me, would you?

[They go to The Florist Palace at the end of the street.]

Gate Guard: Well, well, well! If it isn’t Kiryu-san! And your lady fried here is your…?

Kaoru: His what?

Gate Guard: …Nothing! Perish the thought!

Kiryu: I’ve got some business inside…

Gate Guard: Of course! You’re welcome any time, sir.

[Kiryu opens the door and enters. He is holding a tanto with red flowers on the handle.]

Kiryu: It’s Kiryu. Anybody home? I know you’re here… Show yourself.

[He sticks the tanto in the floor. Mad laughter comes from somewhere.]

Majima: It’s been too long… Kiryu-chan! You got any idea how lonely I’ve been since ya got outta the game last year? Oh, but I knew my Kiryu-chan would come home sooner or later!

[GORO MAJIMA. President of Majima Construction.]

Kaoru: Who or what is he?

Kiryu: Former captain of the Tojo Clan’s Shimano Family… He was my aniki once. He had a hand in last year’s incident, too. It’s been awhile, Majima-san.

Majima: The hell, Kiryu-chan. Ya already got a lady? What a player!

Kiryu: Don’t get the wrong idea.

Majima: Aww, no need to be shy ’bout it! Right, babe?

Kaoru: Osaka PD Division Four’s Kaoru Sayama. …Charmed.

Majima: Osaka PD? Division Four? You’re a copper, sweetheart? Kiryu-chan, what the fuck?

Kiryu: Moving on… Why are you even down here?

Majima: ‘Cause the last guy gave up his digs.

Kiryu: The Florist left?

Kaoru: Florist…?

Kiryu: Yeah, he’s this legendary information dealer who ran the operation here a year ago.

Majima: Yup. "The Florist of Sai" they call him. The guy’s an ex-cop. Used to deliver info on bouquet cards, so the name followed.

Kiryu: Where is he now, then?

Majima: Went back to the sunny side.

Kiryu: Sunny side?

Majima: He’s subcontractin’ to the cops. All the cameras in Kamurocho work for them now. Well, far as the Florist is concerned, I guess it’s just new place, same ol’ shit, eh?

Kiryu: So he’s back on police payroll?

Majima: Yup. And when he left, this place turned into a ghost town. So I figured I’d start up Majima Construction and get to work on Kamurocho Hills!

Kiryu: Kamurocho Hills?

Majima: Didn’t ya see it up there? That huge-ass steel skeleton? That’s Kamurocho Hills, buddy! Course, I’m only in it ’cause this little underground city was part of the package…

Kiryu: You never cease to amaze.

Majima: Right!? So… What brings ya here?

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan… needs you.

Majima: For fuck’s sake. What’s this’ BS now!? You’re a shitty comedian, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: I’m serious. The Tojo Clan has never needed you more than now. Please.

Majima: No fuckin’ way.

Kiryu: (bows) Please…

Majima: You’re killin’ me, Kiryu-chan! I can’t stand seein’ ya like this! Please, Majima-san…

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan is as good as dead without the Majima Family. Please! If that’s how ya want it…

Majima: Only on one condition, though.

Kiryu: What is it?

Majima: A little thing only you can do, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: Seriously…?

Majima: Oh yeah. A tournament. So? You in?

Kaoru: Tournament? What does he mean?

Kiryu: This won’t take long. I’ll meet you back at Serena.

[Kaoru leaves.]

Kiryu: So, where’d the Florist go?

Majima: He’s up in the Millennium Tower.

Kiryu: What?

Majima: 50th floor, last I heard. Guy gets stuck underground long enough, I guess he starts yearnin’ for the sky.

Kiryu: Maybe so…

Majima: Anyway, are ya ready for a good ol’ fashioned beating? Hit me when you’re ready, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: (Maybe I should check in with Komaki before I tackle this tournament.)

Majima: Ya ready, Kiryu-chan?

Just a second.
Tell me the rules first. +
I’m all set.

Kiryu: I want to know what this tournament’s about before I do this.

Majima: Oh, ya wouldn’t be gettin’ cold feet now, would ya? Well… It’s gonna be you up against three of my best, one after another. That’s all it is. Just you and my boys, makin’ a bloody mess of each other. Pretty fun, right, Kiryu-chan?

Kiryu: Well, at least I get it now.

Feel the Heat! (sub story)
[He finds Komeki in some filthy alley, sleeping in a tent. It seems the old master is not doing very well.]

Old Man: Oho, my prized pupil! So you have chosen to grace me with your presence!

Kiryu: Hey there, old man. Long time no see.

Old Man: I’d heard whispers of a dragon rematerializing in the unkempt streets of Kamurocho, and I am pleased to find they were true. I, Sotaro Komaki, shall train you anew.

Kiryu: You haven’t changed at all, old man. Sounds like you’re still pretty active, too.

Komaki: Ohoho! I may be advancing in age, but my strength shall endure as a mighty river through a verdant mountain! Some rapscallions in white jerseys learned that lesson the hard way when they sought to challenge me for ownership of this lot.

Kiryu: White jerseys? Sounds familiar.

Komaki: They are no more, regardless. Now I can dedicate my entire strength to training pupils such as you. Having said that, we have already trained extensively. So, let us first ensure you have not rusted like a blade in the beating rain. Show me your strength, my pupil.

Kiryu: You just want me to attack you?

Komaki: Hm? No! I want you to focus your energy in combat, and let that power envelop you. Doing so will draw out the full extent of your strength and elevate your consciousness to a higher state of being. I call this state… Extreme Heat Mode.

Kiryu: Sounds pretty extreme.

Komaki: You will grow accustomed to it in time. Soon, this power shall rise from within you as effortlessly as the sun at dawn. Now, to activate Extreme Heat Mode, press R2 when you have a full Heat Gauge. If your Heat Gauge runs dry, simply attack enemies to fill it. Well then, I believe it is time for you to prove your mettle.

[Three thugs appear before Kiryu.]

Komaki: This rabble should be adequate subjects for your newly learned ability. Are you ready, my pupil?

Kiryu: I think so. I just have to press R2 with a full Heat Gauge. Right?

Komaki: Oho, right you are! You are actually listening! Now then… Begin!

[Kiryu defeats his opponents using Extreme Heat Mode.]

Komaki: Incredible, my disciple. Truly incredible.

Kiryu: So that’s what you meant by drawing out all of my strength…

Komaki: Remember that feeling well. It will prove invaluable the next time you are besieged by hooligans. I shall have another lesson for you in the near future. Now get out there and continue your training!

Kiryu: Will do. Thanks, old man.

[Kiryu returns to Majima.]

Majima: Ya ready, Kiryu-chan?

Just a second.
Tell me the rules first.
I’m all set. +

Kiryu: Yeah, I’m all set.

Majima: Hell yeah! Let’s get this started, then!

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen! At long last, the Dragon of Dojima returns to the ring! He endured a decade of unjust jail time, only to save the city and become a legend! Last year’s underground king of the ring, Kazuma Kiryu! Facing him, a rising star of the cage! The Brazilian Juggernaut… Robison Caetano di Sciuva! So, after a year’s absence, the champion returns to the ring! Who will victory smile upon tonight!? Now, the gong!

[Kiryu defeats a strange guy in a pelt and with an axe.]

Announcer: Winner! Kazuma Kiryu! The champion remains a legend! But! Our next challenger is yet another lost legend of the cage! The king of the ring dethroned last year, Gary Buster Holmes!

Gary: Some coincidence, huh, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Gary: Sudden death or Asian youth… Which you want?

Kiryu: I see your Japanese still sucks.

Announcer: Legendary yakuza versus legendary fallen king! An epic battle sounds the gong!

[Kiryu defeats the muscular black guy.]

Announcer: Kiryu’s a beast! He’s unstoppable! A complete domination over the fallen king! Here we are at the final round… Time for the big man himself to make his entrance! Give it up for our reigning tournament champion… Goro Majima.

[Majima is as extravagant as usual. He dances with his tanto in his hands in sparks from fireworks.]

Announcer: In his six months since appearing in the ring… …The Mad Dog of Shimano has yet to taste defeat! Look at that chilling chiurance! Half performance art, half raw power! Is kiryu the man to take him down? And now, he enters the ring!

Majima: Whaddya think, Kiryu-chan!? Ain’t I red hot!?

Kiryu: You always were the one guy I couldn’t read.

Majima: Well, let’s do this shit. I’ll keep it fair n’ square!

Announcer: Now, the gong!

[Kiryu fights his sworn best friend and wins.]

Majima: That’s the Kiryu-chan I know… Still a goddamn tough customer…

Kiryu: You promised me… Come back to the Tojo Clan.

Majima: Right, let’s hash this shit out over a drink.

[Kiryu runs to The Florist Palace to drink with Majima.]

Majima: Nice moves out there… Glad ya still got it, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: I did what you asked. Are you going to hold up your end?

Majima: Yeah, yeah. A promise is a promise. Ya really want me back in the Tojo Clan?

Kiryu: No… You don’t need to rejoin them.

Majima: Eh? You changin’ the terms on me, Kiryu-chan? That ain’t what ya said earlier.

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan can’t handle you. You’re way more than they could hope to chew. So I just want you to give them a hand. They need your strength now.

Majima: Oh, so ya want me to give ’em a little juice is all?

Kiryu: Basically. Think you can do that form

Majima: Fine. Only ’cause it’s you, Kiryu-chan. But I gotta ask… Is the Tojo Clan really so fucked that you’d call me in?

Kiryu: Shindo is threatening to split the Nishikiyama Family off from the clan.

Majima: That’d be what, half the Tojo’s men?

Kiryu: More or less. And with the Go-Ryu Clan bearing down on the city, the timing’s terrible.

Majima: Yeah? Well this is all settin’ off my stank detector, Kiryu-chan. It don’t feel right.

Kiryu: Why do you say that?

Majima: Can’t help but feel like someone’s pullin’ your string.

Kiryu: How so?

Majima: Well, the Omi capped Terada, yeah? Let’s start there.

Kiryu: Yeah. Right in front of me.

Majima: That’s some iffy shit.

Kiryu: Iffy? Seems pretty clear cut to me, but let’s hear it.

Majima: When Terada took the reins, the Omi actually stopped makin’ trouble for the Tojo Clan. We were makin’ trouble for them.

Kiryu: Really? Then the attack is what’s strange to you?

Majima: Hey, if it was a Go-Ryu power play, maybe it’s legit. That crazy fuck’ll kill ya then steal your pants. But Terada didn’t make enough waves to warrant a hit.

Kiryu: But if it would weaken the clan… they wouldn’t take the opportunity?

Majima: Hey, I been outta the game a while now. Can’t say I know all the fine print. All I’m sayin’ is I never liked the guy.

Kiryu: Why not?

Majima: He was always givin’ us that weak shit about "peace n’ coexistence.” And now look, everyone thinks the Tojo Clan’s lost its sack. ‘Sides…

Kiryu: Besides what?

Majima: Terada left the whole clan scramblin’ around like this… Just goes to show he never had his shit together.

Kiryu: Then… You didn’t trust Terada?

Majima: Naw. That man wasn’t the kinda yakuza fools thought he was.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Majima: Terada surrounded himself with nothin’ but head-bobbin yes-men. The old guard like me n’ Kashiwagi got sidelined soon as he took over.

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san too?

Majima: Yeah. Acting clan captain my ass. He was an ornament. Gave him a cushy office in the Millennium Tower, but he still couldn’t do shit without Terada’s nod. I got tired of the Terada drama… So I bailed.

Kiryu: Hard to believe that’s the man Terada really was…

Majima: Eh, can’t fault ya for not bein’ a mind-reader. But Kiryu-chan… Ain’t nothin’ wrong with trustin’ a guy, but ya gotta be careful…

[The alarm goes on.]

Majima: Tch… This shit again? Some fools don’t know when to quit!

Kiryu: What’s this alarm for?

Majima: It’s the intruder alarm for the build site. They’re a pain in my ass lately.

Kiryu: Who’s invading your site?

Majima: Just some fuckwads tryin’ to steal our Kamurocho Hills plans.

Kiryu: They’re after your Hills plan…?

Majima’s Worker: Boss! Bad news! It’s them again! What do we do?

Majima: C’mon… Show ’em to the door, that’s what! We gotta get wild again. Form up!

Majima’s Worker: R-Right!

[The worker runs away.]

Majima: Attackin’ us like this all the damn time… They’ve sure got balls!

[Majima and his men goes on the street. There’s a group of men waiting for them.]

Majima: Huh… That’s a lotta dudes. They finally takin’ this seriously?

Kiryu: So, what now? Against that many… You have a game plan?

Majima: You’re damn right I do! Punch ’em all dead! Right, Nishida!?

Nishida: R-Right!

Kiryu: Okay… Then count me in.

Majima: You, Kiryu-chan?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Nishida: Nice! Kiryu-san’s worth at least a hundred guys! That’s cool, right boss!?

Majima: Nope. He can’t.

Nishida: Wha!?

Majima: This fight’s ours to deal with. Kiryu-chan ain’t got a stake in our business.

Nishida: Y-Yeah, but…

Majima: Zip it! If I say he stays outta our business, he stays the hell out! Or are ya sayin’ we won’t win without his help. That what yer gettin’ at!? Huh!?

Nishida: N-No, that’s not what I meant!

Kiryu: I can see your point here. But all the same… I’m helping you.

Majima: Eh? And why’s that?

Kiryu: Didn’t you just promise to help me out because I’ve got trouble on my end? So tell me… Why wouldn’t I extend the same courtesy to you? You manned up, and here’s my answer. So too bad, because it’s personal now. That’s just the kinda guy I am… And you know full well, right?

Majima: Heh, so be it. Fine! Kiryu-chan gets to lend a hand without even raisin’ one.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Majima: Kiryu-chan… You’re gonna be the foreman!

Kiryu: The foreman…?

Majima: Yup! The foreman! Majima Japan’s… Foreman Kiryu!

Kiryu: ….You’re kinda losing me here.

Majima: Y’see, they ain’t here to kick our asses… They’re here to wreck our shit!

Kiryu: Your equipment?

Majima: Yeah! They’re tryin’ to destroy our stuff, cause a setback on the Hills plan, and then swoop in on the deal.

Kiryu: I see now… Then we need to toss them out while protecting your equipment.

Majima: That’s exactly it. But y’see… We ain’t so hot on defense… We get so caught up cavin’ faces in, we kinda forget about the gear… That’s why I want ya to take a top view and give orders to protect the gear while we wreck shop.

Kiryu: I can see that, but… That’s not exactly my forte…

Majima: Weren’t ya gonna man the fuck up? Um countin’ on ya here! It’s the foreman’s job!

Kiryu: Heh… You got it.

Nishida: Boss! They’re about to strike!

Majima: Good shit! Let’s do this, Kiryu-chan!

Kiryu: Yeah!

Majima: Majima Construction… Let’s get to work!

[Kiryu helps defend Majima’s equipment in unique tower defense style gameplay.]

Majima: You guys did great. We mopped ’em all up, I think. Not too shabby, Foreman Kiryu. Ya got a real knack for this.

Kiryu: I won’t lie, that was hard…

[Two guys dressed like cyberpunk pimps approaches.]

Man: Bravo! Man, Majima Construction is one fine company. Eh? Who’re you? A new hire or something?

Kiryu: It’s Kiryu. And who might you be?

Man: Whoops! My bad, guy. Name’s Keiji Mutoh, CEO of Mutoh Realty.

[KEIJI MUTOH. CEO of Mutoh Realty.]

Kiryu: Mutoh Realty…

Keiji: Yeah, we’re a pretty big firm ’round these parts. I keep asking Majima-san here to give us the Hills plan, but he’s playin’ hardball.

Kiryu: That means you guys are…

Majima: Yeah, the ass rats we’ve been beatin’ back.

Keiji: You’re so stubborn, Majima-san! He won’t give the go no matter how much cash we flash

Majima: I don’t got a single hill in these plans for guys like you.

Keiji: Oh yeah? Well then I guess taking them by force is all we’ve got left. Right, Chono?

Chono: Yeah…

[MASAHIRO CHONO. Leader of the Color Gang.]

Keiji: This’s my partner, Chono. He’s the head of the color gangs in these parts.

Chono: It’s gonna be a pleasure, Majima-san and… Kiryu-san, was it? Figured my boys would be able to take down a simple construction company… But I guess not. You guys are the real deal. Why you gwastin’ away as civilians?

Keiji: Yeah… Hey, want me to introduce ya to my yakuza buds? Feel like a career change?

Kiryu: No thanks, I’m good.

Keiji: Suit yourself. Anyway, I just wanted to say hi. Wanna head out?

Chono: Yeah. With this guy helpin’ out… We’ll need to step our game up.

Keiji: Step it up, huh? Think we should get the Three Musketeers involved? Not sure that’s wise,

Kiryu: Three Musketeers…?

Chono: The Three Musketeers land sharks… Ever heard of ’em?

Majima: Hmph. Not ringin’ any bells here.

Chono: Hm. As a construction company president, you probably oughta study up. Well, you’ll meet ’em soon enough. It’ll be good times.

Keiji: Let’s roll, Chono. I’m starving.

Chono: Right.

Keiji: Hey, Majima Construction!

Majima: Eh?

Keiji: Playtime’s over. I’m goin’ all out next time.

Kiryu: Hm. Can’t wait.

Majima: We won’t hold back either. Three Musketeers or not, we’ll smoke the lot of ya.

Keiji: Haha! The Hills plan is a cash cow… Too much steak for you to handle! Better get ready.

Chono: I’ll crush the lot of you! Just you wait!

[They leave.]

Majima: This is my bad, Kiryu-chan. Didn’t wanna drag ya into this shit show.

Kiryu: You’ve done more for me than this. This is nothing. We can’t let those guys interfere with the Hills plan. Let’s break them.

Majima: Heh, damn right. Gotta admit, the prospect of fightin’ alongside Kiryu-chan again is gettin’ me hyped!

Kiryu: Heh.

Majima: Alright! Let’s build Kamurocho Hills over the pools of their blood! Foreman Kiryu leadin’ Majima Japan… It’s officially on!!

[Next scene. Keiji and Chono stand in some luxury hotel room. There’s three men before them sittin on a couch.]

Chono: I apologize for having to bring you all together today, Three Musketeers.

Man 1: Right, pretty rare to get an invite from you, yeah? Here I was thinking you hated our guts.

[RIKI CHOSHU. CEO of Chosu Production.]

Keiji: How could I hate you three? You’re all my senpai… Nothin’ but respect.

Man 2: I don’t really give a shit. Get to the point .

[GENICHIRO TENRYU. CEO of Tenryu Enterprise.]

Keiji: Tenryu-san… Still so impatient!

Chono: I asked you here for one reason. We want your help taking the Kamurocho Hills plan.

Tenryu: Kamurocho Hills?

Man 3: Yeah? Sounds fancy… I can smell the money already.

[TATSUMI FUJINAMI. CEO of Fujinami LTD.]

Choshu: The hell? What’s this hills crap? There a profit in it?

Fijinami: That’s the plan to build a commercial district over ol West Park, yeah? That’s gotta be worth over a bil.

Choshu: Yeah? Nice. Let’s get those plans then.

Chono: That’s what I’m getting at… But I’ve got a problem.

Fijinami: A problem?

Tenryu: If Chono and Mutoh are comin’ to us… It must be some fierce competition…

Chono: Exactly right, Tenryu-san. You nailed it. The Hills plan is contracted to Majima Construction. Its president is Goro Majima… He’s a former Tojo Clan officer. Earned his name on the streets, “The Mad Dog of Shimano.”

Choshu: Yeah? What’s a guy like that doin’ running a construction company? Life’s just full’a surprises.

Chono: And his right-hand man… Kazuma Kiryu. Check it out… He’s the ex-fourth chairman of the Tojo Clan… The Dragon of Dojima… A yakuza legend.

Tenryu: Kiryu…?

Fijinami: What’s up, Tenryu?

Tenryu: Nah, it’s nothing.

Choshu: In other words, you can’t handle Kiryu and Majima, so you’re calling in the specialists.

Keiji: Right on the mark, Choshu-san! You got it. We need ya to knock ’em out and take that Kamurocho Hills plan. The Hills are money… Name a price, and it’s yours. That sound agreeable?

Fijinami: I’m in. Long as the cash is good, no job’s too small. That’s how I roll. And this Dragon of Dojima dude? Gotta say I’m curious. After all… I’m a dragon myself. (laughs)

Keiji: Nice, a battle of dragons, huh? Should be exciting… Ha ha ha…

Chono: What about you, Choshu-san?

Choshu: My jobs have been shit lately. I’ve been lookin’ for something a little meaner. The Dragon of Dojima and the Mad Dog of Shimano… Sounds like a blast. As the Revolution Warrior… I’ll show them that reality is a cruel world.

Fijinami: Tenryu… You in? I heard you’d gotten outta the game.

Choshu: Really? That true?

Tenryu: Yeah, but if it’s Kiryu we’re talking here… I’m all the way in.

Chono: Then we’ve got an accord.

Keiji: Right! It’s all on you, the Three Musketeers land sharks! First guy to bring back the Hills plan gets the whole shebang!

Chono: As for men, you’ve got full rein over my gang of boys. We’re hoping… You can win.

Choshu: Eh? Who ya think you’re talking to? I don’t botch my jobs.

Fijinami: Better move quick… Sorry gents, but that payout’s gonna be mine. Heh heh.

[Tenryu groans.]

Keiji: Huh?

Tenryu: Kazuma Kiryu…

[Back to our hero.]

Kiryu: (I should get back to Serena for now.)

[He gets back to the bar. Kaoru plays with her gun as a worried wife.]

Kaoru: It’s past midnight, you know. Daigo Dojima’s expecting you at 1:00, yeah?

[Kiryu lights a cigarette.]

Kaoru: What’s your deal? You really have time for this?

Kiryu: Hey… Aren’t you scared?

Kaoru: Of what?

Kiryu: Of finding out the truth about your past.

Kaoru: What kind of question is that?

Kiryu: Just hear me out. My own parents… Were murdered by the Tojo Clan.

Kaoru: What?

Kiryu: I learned that last year. The man who killed them… …Was the guy who led me to this life. A man named Shintaro Kazama.

Kaoru: That’s the secret you mentioned earlier?

Kiryu: I grew up thinking of Kazama-san as my father, so I was able to forgive him in the end. But… What about you?

Kaoru: If it were me… If I learn who killed my parents… I don’t think I’ll forgive them, no matter who it is. Of course I’m scared to find out. But it’s fine. This is the road I’ve chosen.

Kiryu: I see… …Then use me how you can. Stay close, and go hard at the Tojo Clan. If that’s how you’ll discover your past, I say do it.

Kaoru: You mean that? You were in the Tojo Clan, weren’t you? How can you say that?

Kiryu: I’m not proud of my life as a yakuza.

Kaoru: And if you had something to do with it?

Kiryu: Then you point that thing at me, pull the trigger, and don’t look back. You said you couldn’t forgive anyone, didn’t you?

Kaoru: Right… I’ll do that.

[She stands from her chair.]

Kiryu: Where are you going?

Kaoru: To do my job.

Kiryu: What job?

Kaoru: You’re in my protective custody. So let’s move.

Majima Saga - Chapter 1: TOJO CLAN REFORM
February 17th, 2006

[Tojo Clan HQ. Terada, alive and well at the time, enters the meeting room and sits in his chair as the chairman.]

[YUKIO TERADA. Fifth Chairman of the Tojo Clan.]

Patriarch 1: Fifth Chairman! We aren’t going to stoop to conducting our business like two-bit criminals!

Patriarch 2: The Tojo Clan abides the Tojo Clan’s code, and no one else’s! Just because you’re a former Omi man doesn’t mean that’s how we do things here!

Patriarch 1: Exactly! I don’t know what this Tojo Clan Reformation is about, but we’re not just money-grubbing thugs like the Omi!

Patriarch 3: All I hear is the cheepin’ and chirpin’ of a buncha whiners!

[AKINOBU UEMATSU. Patriarch of the Uematsu Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

Uematsu: Flappin’ your lips after postin’ up chump change profits… If ya wanna preen in here… Do it after ya send up some real revenue, dipshits!

Patriarch 1: The fuck you say? You think being the fifth chairman’s little pet gives you the right to talk like that!? You’re just a baby fresh up from some third-rate family! Know your goddamn place!

Patriarch 4: One’s tenure no longer has any bearing here.

[KEI IBUCHI. Patriarch of the Ibuchi Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

Ibuchi: Those who produce profits are promoted, those who can’t fall from grace. A blood transfusion based on results and ability… That’s the basic concept behind the fifth chairman’s Tojo Clan Reformation Plan. Power is transferred to those who produce results, whether you’re the old guard or the new blood. Which means… Since we’re the ones showing profits, we can talk to you however we see fit.

Patriarch 1: What was that!?

[Every patriarch stands from their couches, offended.]

Terada: I will have order!

[Patriarchs sit down.]

Terada: Shall we proceed? Then I call to order this executive’s meeting.

Kashiwagi: Fifth Chairman…What is today’s agenda? Is this the Tojo Clan Reformation again?

Terada: Yes. We’re picking up where we left off. It’s time to select who will fill the clan captain’s empty seat. The clan captain is a position that acts as my right-hand in the Tojo Clan. It’s a role that has the power to determine the fate of our organization. However, as an outsider myself, this decision is a difficult one to make. Which is why I will select this person through the rules established by my Tojo Clan Reformation project.

Kashiwagi: Rules?

Terada: The Tojo Clan Reformation seeks to elevate those who produce results… "Results," meaning profits, the group that tithes the highest cut into headquarters… That family’s patriarch will become the Tojo Clan’s next clan captain.

[The patriarchs seem to gladly accept the challenge.]

Terada: That all said… Let’s look at the total revenues produced by each family for the clan. … Ibuchi.

Ibuchi: Yes, sir. Please direct your attention to the screen.

[Families revenue table appears on the screen.]

Patriarch 1: What the hell…

Patriarch 2: No way… Is the gap really that large?

Ibuchi: As you can see, the Tojo Clan’s old guard families have more or less the same margins across the board. Well, Kashiwagi-san’s Kazama Family seems to be making some effort… Still, even the Kazama Family falls behind two groups who more than double his score. That would be my Ibuchi Family and Uematsu-san’s Uematsu Family, of course. The very "newcomers" you have so much disdain for, correct? Going by the numbers, Uematsu is clearly first. So it would seem… Uematsu-san is our next clan captain.

Patriarch 1: Bullshit! You only pull numbers like that because you’ve got your hands in dirty business!

Patriarch 2: In the Tojo Clan, we actually have ethics. Even if the fifth chairman condones this… I never will!

Patriarch 5: Are you so blinded by profits that you’ve lost the yakuza spirit!?

Uematsu: All you pussies can shut the fuck up! You gripe… But we’re the reason you’ve got food on the table! We don’t work our asses off for charity. It’s only right that we get ranks fitting our contribution to the clan! If you’ve got a problem with that… Try makin’ as much as we do!

Ibuchi: It seems there are no further objections. Then our next clan captain is Uematsu-san of the Uematsu Family.

Terada: Mm.

[A sound of laughter and murmuring coming from behind the door of the meeting room.]

Uematsu: Huh?

[Majima enters the room in his usual frantic manner and sits in the captain’s chair.]

Majima: Don’t mind if I do!

[GORO MAJIMA. Patriarch of the Majima Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary.]

Uematsu: Hey… I don’t recall that bein’ your seat.

Majima: Shut up and watch.

[He claps.]

Majima: Roll it in!

[Three of Majima’s men roll up a cart full of money.]

Patriarch 1: What in the hell is that!? Where’d he get all that money!?

Ibuchi: Impossible… How? How’d you get this much!?

[Majima smiling.]

Majima: See, I’d been itchin’ to play some baseball… So I lent some money in exchange for this teeeeeny dirt patch near Kamurocho. Next thing I know, some business swoops in askin’ to buy that land so they can build on it or somethin’. So I put a crazy-ass price on it, and somehow I ended up with a barrel fulla money. What can I say? Money comes easy when I actually try a little. But oh damn… If we re going purely off profit, your next clan captain’s gonna be me of all people! You’re the fifth chairman, though… The criteria’s totally up to you. All I’m sayin’ is… Underestimate the Tojo Clan, and its dog’s gonna bite ya.

Ibuchi: Fifth Chairman… Your thoughts?

Terada: Let’s table the issue for now. We’ll revisit the policy at our next executive meeting.

Majima: What gives? This seat’s just as stiff as the others!

[The meeting is over. Majima leaves the hall and speaks to the patriarchs.]

Toda (Patriarch 2): I don’t know him well, but I’m hearing that lbuchi’s a clever devil. Terada’s only standing on his own two feet thanks to that kid. I still can’t tell what’s going on in Terada’s head, though. I’ll never forgive the fourth chairman for putting us in this mess…

[As Majima approaches the exit he is stopped by Kashiwagi.]

Kashiwagi: Majima… What are you planning to do after pulling a stunt like that?

Majima: Specifically? Nothin’. Just gonna keep doin’ my thing.

Kashiwagi: Uematsu’s not likely to take a slight like that lying down, you know. Be careful, would you?

Majima: Sure.

Yajima (Patriarch 1): The Mad Dog of Shimano strikes again.. Incredible, Majima-san. Ha, I’m sure you gave Uematsu a lot to think about, eh? I’m just glad he got his ass handed to him.

Majima: Heh.

[He approaches his car and speaks to the driver.]

Kawamura: Another great day at the office, boss? Nishida-aniki and the others already headed back. I’m ready to roll if you are, sir.

[They hit the road.]

Kawamura: What do you think’s gonna happen to the Tojo Clan?

Majima: Ehh?

Kawamura: No it’s just, all this talk about a Tojo Clan reformation… Is it really wise to let money be the deciding factor on everything? And those Uematsu-san and Ibuchi-san guys… Think you can trust them?

Majima: It’s nothin’ a new kid like you needs to stress about.

Kawamura: Y-You’re right… Sorry.

Majima: Doesn’t matter. Terada’s the fifth chairman. If he says somethin’s black, it’s black. If he says it’s white, it’s white. That’s the world ya sign up for as a yakuza. Long as he trusts ’em… So be it. But I say they’re both shady as fuck. Not a huge fan of either one of ’em.

Kawamura: I agree… I think you’d make a much better clan captain, boss.

Majima: No way in hell I’m takin’ the captain’s seat.

Kawamura: Huh? You wouldn’t?

Majima: Hell no! wouldn’t last a day with a con man like Terada! Terada probably wants Uematsu, one of his own boys. This Tojo Clan Reformation shit is just an excuse to get his own crew into executive roles.

Kawamura: You’re saying it’s rigged?

Majima: Well, pretty much. Yakuza these days beat around the bush too much… Or maybe I’m just agin outta this yakuza thing…

Kawamura: No way boss, you’re too young for that!

Majima: Who the hell are you to say!? Now quit bein’ such a goddamn chatterbox and step on it!

Kawamura: Y-Yes, sir!

[Some time later they pull over.]

Kawamura: I’ll go find a parking spot, boss.

Majima: (May as well head back to the office. The Majima empire ain’t gonna run itself.)

[He runs down the street, but then he is surrounded by people in black suits.]

Majima: Huh? Who the hell are ya? Ahh, some of Uematsu’s goons? He works fast, don’t he? That’s cool. (pulls out his tanto) Bring it on!

[He kicks their asses.]

Majima: You fools… You his boys or not!?

Man in black: Heh heh… Actually… You oughta be more worried about your own family! (passes out)

Majima: My family? That a threat? | gotta get to the office!

=Go to the Family Office=
[Majima runs to his office. A group of thighs stands in his way.]

Thug: Heh, my boss said he’d pay me good if I beat the shit out of you! See you in hell, cyclops!

[Majima beats them up and moves along.]

Thug: What’s the hurry? Hang out with us for a while, old guy!

[Majima cuts them to strips and moves along. He found his men near the office severely injured.]

Majima: What the hell?

Nishida: B… Boss…

Majima: Nishida… Who did this?

Nishida: Uematsu… Family…

Majima: Uematsu…! That guy even know who he’s fucking with!? Fine… He wants a war… He’s got one! (Uematsu… Get ready to answer the door, because hell’s about to come knockin’!)

=Go to the Uematsu Family Office=
Majima: (The Uematsu office should be somewhere east of Senryo Avenue. If I head there now, I’ll get the jump on his sorry ass!)

[He finds a building with a sign 植松組 which means “Uematsu Family.”]

Majima: (This is the Uematsu Family office… Weird, nobody’s here celebrating that cheap shot on my boys?)

[He enters the building. There’s blood on the floor. Mjima finds Uematsu… dead. He was shot in the head.]

Majima: Uematsu…

Chapter 6: SCHEMES
[We go back to the present. The camera flies into the Stardust Club, where Yuya brings Date and Kawara drinks on the second floor.]

Yuya: Feel like it’s been forever…

Date: Yeah, a whole year flew by.

Yuya: I still owe you for everything, Date-san.

Date: Nah, I should be thanking you for what you did for Saya.

Kawara: Saya?

Date: She’s my only daughter.

Yuya: How’s Saya-chan doing?

Date: She’s at cosmetology school every day, and she’s loving it.

Yuya: Glad to hear it.

Date: You know, you were just a punk when we met. Now you’re a bonafide manager!

Yuya: Aww, I’ve still got a ton to learn, sir!

[Kazuki enters.]

Kazuki: (bows) Welcome.

Date: Hey… Long time no see. This is Kawara, my senpai from HQ in the force.

Kawara: You must be Kazuki-san? Nice to meet you.

Kazaki: HQ, huh? (bows) A pleasure to meet you, sir.

Date: Sorry to drop two cranky old men on you.

Kazaki: Not at all. Might I ask what brings you here tonight?

Date: I needed to tell you something in private.

Yuya: Oh, I’ll go get you gentlemen some snacks.

[He bows and leaves.]

Kazaki: So what’s going on?

Date: In about an hour, there’s going to be a flood of investigators busting in here.

Kazaki: Huh? Why here?

Date: It’s not just you. They’re raiding sex shops, bars, casinos…

Kazaki: What brought this on?

Date: The Millennium Tower bombing. Sources are pointing to a foreign organization as the perps.

Kazaki: A foreign organization? Really?

Kawara: Tokyo PD would look like fools if that slipped under their radar. So the plan is to mobilize 400 cops to round up all the illegal aliens in one shot.

Kazaki: But… We don’t have any illegals working here.

Kawara: You could still get busted on vice laws. Closing up tonight might be better than getting shut down.

Kazaki: True, I guess… But… Why would you tell me this in advance?

Date: I caused quite a scene here last year. Now we’re even.

Kazaki: Is that so… Date-san, Kawara-san… Thank you both so much.

[He bows and leaves.]

Kawara: There. If he’s mafia, he’ll go straight to his boys.

Date: I still don’t buy it. No way he’s got foreign mafia ties.

Kawara: Look what they managed to pull off. They’re not gonna be easy to bust.

[Kazaki apologizes to the visitors and asks them to leave.]

Date: He’s not acting strange at all. Sure we’re not chasing our tails here?

Kawara: Quit staring! You’ll make him nervous.

Date: We can’t just sit here forever.

Kawara: Just long enough to figure out… …What his next move is.

[Kazaki runs out of the club.]

Date: What!?

Kawara: Got him! Come on, Makoto!

Yuya: Ah, whoa! What’s going on, Date-san!?

[Date and Kawara run after Kazaki. We go back to Kiryu and Kaoru.]

Kaoru: Time’s almost up. Let’s head to this “Amano Building.”

Go to the Amano Building
Kaoru: But do you even know where it is?

Kiryu: No… I can ask Tamura, though.

Kaoru: That’s your info guy who hangs out near Theater Square? Worth checking, I suppose. But let’s hurry.

[On his way out of the Siren, Kiryu encounters Yuya. ]

Yuya: Hey, if it isn’t Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: Yuya. Been a while, hasn’t it? It’s good to see you.

Yuya: Yeah, likewise. Just wish it was under better circumstances…

Kiryu: Why, what’s wrong?

Yuya: Oh, it’s Kazaki… He’s…

Kiryu: Kazaki? He’s okay, right?

Yuya: Er… Well, I don’t know, actually. Date-san came by the club for the first time in at least a year, and we were all stoked to see him, but… Something must have gone wrong, ’cause Kazaki went running out of the club…

Kiryu: All because of Date-san? What could have happened…

Yuya: I didn’t want to pry, but he was with another detective, I think.

Kiryu: You know where Date-san is now?

Yuya: He ran out, too. He might have even been chasing after Kazaki.

Kiryu: …This does sound pretty odd.

Kaoru: Look, I know you’re worried about this, but don’t you think the Amano Building should be the real priority here?

Kiryu: …You’re right. Yuya, we’ll catch up soon. If anything comes up in the meantime though, just give me a call.

Yuya: All right, will do!

[Kiryu runs to the Theater Square.]

Morita: Ah, Kiryu-san? I’m Morita. I deal in information. Tamura’s a friend of mine. He’s told me a lot a lot about you. But I should mention that I haven’t seen Tamura lately…Hopefully, he’ll be back soon. Anyway, if you need anything, I’m happy to help.

You know Kazuki? +
Where’s the Amano Building?
Any word on Daigo Dojima?

Kiryu: You know Kazuki? I’ve got a friend who’s worried about him. Any idea where he is?

Morita: Hmm, sorry. That’s news to me. I’ll keep my ear to the ground, though.

Where’s the Amano Building? +
Any word on Daigo Dojima?


Kiryu: I’m looking for the Amano Building. Know where it is?

Morita: Ah, that’d be in front of the Children’s Park. It’s been abandoned for awhile now, though… I hear this gang of kids has moved in that go by the name, “16-Bit.”

Any word on Daigo Dojima? +

Kiryu: Have you heard any word on Daigo Dojima?

Morita: Hmm, no actually. There used to be news about him every night, but he’s gone dark. Wonder what happened to him?

[Gathering information, Kiryu easily finds the place.]

Kiryu: This should be the Amano Building… Hm? It’s locked.

[Some kids approthes him.]

16-Bit: Hey! You with those assholes inside!?

Kiryu: I’m sorry?

16-Bit: Playin’ dumb? Well drop your dumb ass!

Minions: Fuck yeah!

[Kiryu and Kaoru easily punch them to the ground.]

16-Bit: Huff… Huff…

Kiryu: What the hell was that about?

16-Bit: This place… was our hideout, man… Then these guys speaking another language showed up… You’re not with ‘em?

Kiryu: No, I’m not. But I do want to have some words with them. You know where the key to this place is?

16-Bit: Our boss carries it on him, but he’s out right now.

Kiryu: Out? Out where?

16-Bit: In the alley behind the drugstore, usually. No way he’s just gonna give you the key, though!

Kiryu: If you kids are anything to go by, maybe he will.

16-Bit: Pah! Go see for yourself, old man.

Kaoru: Come on.

Kiryu: Right.

[They find the gang “boss.” It’s just a kid playing on his handheld console.]

Nashino: Whaddaya want!? I’m fighting a boss here, man! If you know what’s good for you, you’ll fuck right off!

Kiryu: Hey, you wouldn’t happen to be the leader of those 16-Bit kids, are you?

Nashino: Gah! It’s my last continue!

Kaoru: Hey! Have you heard a word we’ve said, little punk!? Put down the damn game!

Nashino: What!? Yeah, I heard you the first time, and I said fuck off!

Kiryu: I just need the key to the Amano Building, and we’ll leave you alone.

Nashino: Are you still here? You’re throwing me off, asshole!

Kiryu: (grabs him) Sometimes there are more important things in life than video games!

Nashino: Not right now there isn’t! Sounds like we’re at an impasse so I’m gonna kick your ass! Give me just a sec, though… (calling) Hello? ‘Sup, bro, I got these assholes givin’ me shit right now. Come gimme a hand with this. Yeah! Right now, man!

Kiryu: …You actually called in back up?

[A fat guy walks in.]

Nashino: Ahh, there’s my boy!

[Kiryu and Kaoru fight the Nashino Brothers and show them what the real boss fight looks like.]

Kiryu: Hand over the key!

Nashino: I’ve still got… my second form…

Kaoru: If it’s anything like your first form, you’re in for another beating if you don’t give us that key!

Nashino: Rrgh… Fine. I remember this…

[He hands over the key and passes away.]

Kaoru: This should get us in. Let’s get back to the Amano Building!

[Near Amano Building.]

Kiryu: They told me to come alone, so we should part ways here.

Kaoru: Can’t say I agree with your plan. but fine. Call me if you even think things are going sideways.

[Kiryu enters the building.]

Find Daigo
[He clears floor after floor using the classic baseball bat and even shield to fight armed men in black! On the roof he finds Date, Kawara and… two Kazuki.]

Kiryu: Date-san!

Date: Kiryu!?

Kawara: Ah, Kiryu.

Kiryu: Kazuki!

Two Kazuki (at the same time): Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: What the hell is this!?

Date: Don’t ask me. We tailed Kazuki here and found two of him!

Right Kazuki: I’m the real one! They had me locked up! I was up here when I came to!

Left Kazuki: That’s a lie! You dragged me up here at gunpoint!

Date: (to Kiryu) Why are you here?

Kiryu: I was told to be here at one o’clock.

Kawara: The hell?

Kiryu: Figures… It was a trap.

Kawara: Sure seems that way.

[He aims his gun at the left Kazaki.]

Left Kazaki: Wh-What are you doing?

Date: Kawara-san!

Kawara: The one who led us up here is the fake. He put on a good show down at Stardust, and we took the bait.

Left Kazaki: You’ve got it wrong!

Kawara: Shut up! Don’t underestimate a cop. Change your face all you like, but you can’t disguise your voice. I know for sure you’re the one we spoke to at the bar. Now talk. Why did you lure us up here?

Left Kazaki: I don’t know what you’re talking about!

Kawara: Drop the act! Who’s the one writing the script here?

Date: (aims at Kawara) Stop! You’d shoot to kill right in front of me again?

Kawara: Get it straight, Makoto. This guy’s not the Kazuki you know. Just a mafia goon.

Date: How can you say that without any proof?

Kawara: I just know.

Date: Really? You’d kill on your intuition?

Kawara: A cop’s instincts are more than gut feelings. I’ve been in more kill-or-be-killed situations than I can count. This guy reeks of blood. The stench is all over him.

Date: You’re out of your damn mind…

Kawara: (turns to him) Get back!

[At this moment the Left Kazaki pulls out two guns and shot Kawara in the leg and the Right Kazaki in the chest.]

Date: Kawara-san!

Kiryu: Kazuki!

Left Kazaki: Kiryu… I’m the one who called you here yesterday.

Kiryu: It was you…? Where’s Daigo!?

Left Kazaki: No point in giving details to the dead.

Date: So you brought us all up here to kill us?

Left Kazaki: (laughs) You finally get it. The four of you came up, fought, and shot each other dead. That’s the ending to your "script."

Date: The four of us? Why the hell would we kill each other?

Left Kazaki: Once you know the ending, the rest of the story writes itself. That’s just how it works. (laughs)

Kawara: (to Date) Now… Shoot… Do it… Shoot!

[Date thinks for a while and then shoots indecisively, only scratching Left Kazuki’s forehead.]

Left Kazuki: [You… bastard! Die!]

[He prepares to shoot Date but someone shoots him first.]

Kaoru: I heard the gunshots.

[She checks the pulse of the Left Kazuki. He’s dead. Police sirens howling is heard from afar.]

Kiryu: Let’s go!

Kaoru: Why would we run? That was clearly self-defense!

Date: No, there’s something fishy about this. We should lay low for now.

Kiryu: Come on!

Date: Right!

[They help Kazuki and Kawara and leave the scene with them.]

Chapter 7: THE FOREIGN THREAT
[They descend to the streets.]

Date: He needs medical attention, fast. Should we drive him to a hospital?

Kiryu: There’s no time. I know a doctor who runs a clinic in the area. We just need to get him there!

Kaoru: The police are going to be fanning out across the city. You can’t just carry him like that.

Date: We don’t have much choice here. If we wait for the cops to pack it in, we might lose him!

Kaoru: Yeah, I know. Still, good luck explaining this to them if they spot you.

Date: You’re right. We stick out like a sore thumb like this.

Kiryu: Fine, what’s the plan then?

Kaoru: …I’ve got an idea.

Kiryu: Yeah?

Kaoru: Let me draw the attention of the cops just outside first. Nothing they can really do to a fellow officer out of their jurisdiction. I’ll keep them occupied as long as I can. You guys head out the other way.

Kiryu: Think you can pull it off?

Kaoru: We’ll find out … I’ll meet you at the clinic. Where is it?

Kiryu: A little building on the west side of Taihei Boulevard.

Kaoru: Got it!

Hurry to Emoto Clinic
[Kiryu and Date run to the clinic with Kazuki and Kawara on their backs.]

Date: He’s hurt bad. Doc, please!

Doctor: Huh… Kawara-san? And you…

Kiryu: Sorry, but this is kind of an emergency.

Doctor: What happened to your leg?

Kawara: Forget about me. He’s in a lot worse shape.

Doctor: What happened?

Kiryu: He’s been shot.

Doctor: Hm?

Doctor: I know him… He’s a hotshot host in the city, right? We better get him patched up fast. Help me get him on the operating table. This could take a while. I won’t ask questions, but if people are still after you, you should leave. He doesn’t need that kind of attention.

Kiryu: Got it.

[They help the doctor with the operation. Some time later…]

Kiryu: This was the last thing I expected, honestly. I’m still not even sure what happened.

Date: Me either. I wasn’t expecting to find you up there, myself. We should probably compare notes to see if we can learn anything.

Kiryu: Good call. But let’s find a better place to talk first.

Date: Know anywhere quiet?

Let’s go to Serena. +
Let’s go to Stardust.
Let’s go to Bantan.

Date: Serena…? What’s that place like these days?

Kiryu: It’s deserted. Sayama and I are using it as a home base, though.

Date: I see… But Serena is across the street from Stardust. That area’ll be flooded with cops.

Kiryu: You’re right. Let’s avoid that.

Let’s go to Serena.
Let’s go to Stardust.
Let’s go to Bantan. +

Kiryu: I think Bantam would work.

Date: Bantam?

Kiryu: Remember Bacchus? They closed down, and when it re-opened, they called it Bantam.

Date: Oh, that bar behind the Millennium Tower? That’s right, I remember now. So it’s Bantam now, huh?

Kiryu: Yeah… Last year I got to know the bartender there. That’s far enough away from Stardust.

Date: Heh, Bacchus… That’s where you and I joined up for the first time, remember?

Kiryu: Yep. And what a ride it’s been.

[They walk outside the clinic.]

Date: Man… I still can’t get over running into two Kazukis like that.

Kiryu: Yeah… What the hell is going on? I don’t think we should tell Yuya or the Stardust crew about this yet.

Date: Yeah, we’d just worry them. Besides, we don’t know a damn thing about Kazuki’s double. There’s nothing to tell them, really.

Kiryu: And I’d hate to drag Yuya into this mess.

Date: You hear he made manager? I’m sure he can hold down the fort for a while. I feel bad, but I agree. Let’s keep him out of this.

Kiryu: Yeah…

[Yuya suddenly runs to them.]

Yuya: Kiryu-san! Date-san!

Date: Yuya!?

Kiryu: How’d you know we were here?

Yuya: One of our regulars told me she saw a guy who looked like Kazuki being carried in here… I could hardly believe it, but I came running all the same. What happened, though!? Is he going to be okay!? The doc’s got him in surgery now. He was shot.

Yuya: Shot…? Why would anyone shoot Kazuki!? Did he get mixed up in something?

Kiryu: Well…

Date: …There was a yakuza brawl in the street that got out of hand. Unfortunately Kazuki took a stray bullet.

Yuya: Wh-What!? Where are these yakuza, then!? Which of those goddamn bastards did it!? I’ll beat the shit out of the whole family for this!

Kiryu: Calm down Yuya!

Yuya: But…!

Kiryu: Date-san was just telling me you’re the manager of Stardust now.

Yuya: Y-Yeah…

Kiryu: You’re the one responsible for your team and your customers… You of all people should know you can’t lose your cool now.

Yuya: ……

Kiryu: Kazuki’s in bad shape. It’s tough to think about, but who knows how long he’ll need to recover?

Date: Exactly. Kazuki needs you to be strong. Your boys need your strength now more than ever, too.

Yuya: Kiryu-san, Date-san…

Kiryu: Kazuki’s going to make it. You just worry about Stardust.

Yuya: …You’re right. Y’know, even though he promoted me, I don’t think I ever really stopped relying on Kazuki for everything. But I guess that needs to end… I’ve gotta pull it together. Thanks, guys. I’m gonna keep Stardust in the black so Kazuki can rest easy, knowing his club’s in good hands!

[He leaves.]

Date: Phew… I guess we’ve got a band-aid on that for now. We can fill him in on the rest once we know more ourselves.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Date: All right, it’s getting late, but let’s head for Bantam.

[They walk to Bantam.]

Kiryu: Long time no see, barkeep.

Bartender: K-Kiryu-san!? When did you get back into town? Please, have a seat!

[Date and Kiryu sit at the counter.]

Date: (to Kiryu) Brings you back, doesn’t it?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Bartender: What’ll it be, then?

Kiryu: Actually, I need a favor.

[The bartender closes the bar so Kiryu and Date can drink in peace.]

Date: So you went to the Amano Building looking for Daigo Dojima?

Kiryu: Yeah. But the part I don’t get is why someone wants us dead.

Date: Kazuki was just the bait to lure us in. Someone stands to gain from taking us out… What’s the link between us, though? I don’t know.

Kiryu: I’d guess the foreigners who kidnapped Daigo and Chairman Goda are behind this.

Date: Foreigners?

Kiryu: An Osakan detective named Bessho tipped me off.

Date: Bessho?

Kiryu: You know him?

Date: Used to be in Kamurocho’s Division Four.

Kiryu: Wait, Kamurocho?

Date: He was their golden boy when I joined up. Came in around the same time as Kawara. "Bessho the Viper" and "Kawara the Demon." They were legendary.

Kiryu: Hell of a story. Date-san, what you said to Kawara back there… About his kills…

Date: Yeah. I still hold a grudge against the guy.

Kiryu: What exactly happened?

Date: It was just after I started at Division One. More than 15 years ago. As a rookie, I got paired up with Kawara-san, the squad leader back then. We were investigating some illegal aliens… Trying to track down a murder suspect. Kawara-san was just a rank-and-file cop, but he was famous for his stainless record. I asked to tag along for the ride, hoping to pick up a few tips from him. Didn’t take long for any respect I had for him to fly out the window, though.

Kiryu: Why’s that?

Date: They immigrants resisted, so Kawara-san pulled his gun and shot them. Sure, they were putting up a fight. But we’re protectors of the peace, dammit. Shooting should be our last resort. But Kawara-san just mowed them down…

Kiryu: He shot them all?

Date: Yeah. Dead, every one of them. Kawara-san killed them. I was livid. I asked him, suspected criminals or not, how could he kill them without batting an eye? But all Kawara-san had to say was… "They left me no choice. This is on them." That wasn’t the last time Kawara-san opened fire on illegal aliens, either. Every time it happened, it got cleaned up as self-defense… But people started calling him Killer Kawara, and he eventually got bumped from Division One.

Kiryu: That’s quite a history.

Date: The image of those men is still burned into my brain.

Kiryu: It sounds like Kawara’s got some deep scars.

Date: I got the same feeling, but he’d never go into it. But it’s not like he just hates foreigners, either… As for me, Kiryu… I feel worse that I couldn’t stop Kawara-san than I do about shooting Kazuki.

Kiryu: Date-san…

Date: He’s got some seriously heavy baggage. I just wish I could understand him.

Kiryu: Despite it all, you still care about him, don’t you?

Date: Maybe I do.

[They share a few drinks.]

Date: Say, I wonder what happened to Sayama? I hope she made it out all right…

Kiryu: Yeah… I better go look for her.

[He exits the bar. His phone’s ringing.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Kaoru: I just got to the clinic.. Where are you?

Kiryu: We moved. Me and Date-san headed over to a bar called Bantam.

Kaoru: Wait, you decided now would be a good time to hit the town for drinks?

Kiryu: No, but we couldn’t stay. I’ll explain later. I think it’d be best if you meet us over here.

Kaoru: Fine, but where’s “here”? I don’t know the area, remember?

Kiryu: Right. I’ll come get you then. Give me a few.

Kaoru: All right, but hurry.

[Kiryu gets back to the clinic. Kaoru sits there and smokes a cigarette. Kawara sits right next to her.]

Kawara: Smoking doesn’t suit a lady.

Kaoru: I didn’t ask. Don’t act like you’re so hot just because you’re serving in Tokyo.

[But she put the cigarette away.]

Kaoru: What now?

Kawara: Would it kill you to act like a lady?

Kaoru: Excuse me?

Kawara: I hear you’re lead detective for Division Four.

Kaoru: How’d you know?

[Kawara throws her a police badge. Her badge.]

Kawara: I found it up on the roof. Might be bad if it turned up at a crime scene, yeah? Probably dropped it when you went for your gun. Smooth move. Not much you can do in a situation like that, though.

Kaoru: You’re pretty relaxed for a guy with a hole in him.

Kawara: Well, you get used to this sort of thing.

Kaoru: Yeah? I suppose Tokyo cops really do see more action.

Kawara: It’s not like that. Tokyo, Osaka, it’s all the same. I’m just lucky. So, how’s a gal like you find herself working for Division Four?

Kaoru: None of your business. Why the obsession, anyway?

Kiryu: Sorry I’m late.

Kaoru: Took your sweet time.

Kiryu: Kawara-san. Are you all right?

Kawara: Yeah… I’ll pull through.

Kiryu: How’s Kazuki doing?

Kaoru: Still in surgery. That’s the latest.

[Suddenly two men burst in!]

Kaoru: What the!?

[One of them punches the doctor]

Doctor: Who the hell are you!?

Man 1: [Is this Kang?]

Man 2: [Hey, you okay? Get up. We came to get you.]

Kazaki: Who… are you people?

Man 2: [No… He’s not Kang!]

[They leave the operation room.]

Kiryu: You guys with those foreign thugs?

Kaoru: Don’t move! I’m an officer. (wave her badge) What brings you guys here?

[One of the bandits smacks Kaoru in the face.]

Kiryu: …Hold up.

Man 1: (with accent) You people… annoying.

Kiryu: So you do speak Japanese. Makes it that much worse.

Man 1: (with accent) This not concern you.

Kiryu: Oh, it does now.

Man1: What?

Kiryu: I won’t just watch some asshole punch a woman… …Then try to walk away.

Man 1: Fine. We kill you then! Die!

[Kiryu defeats the rude foreigners which were named Kim and Choi by the way. Kawara stands from the couch with his trusty revolver.]

Kawara: Damn, you are tough. Who sent you?

Kiryu: Don’t!

[Kawara shots near Man 1’s head.]

Kawara: The next one won’t miss… Talk!

Man 1: [Korean syndicate… …Jingweon Mafia.]

Kawara: I’m starting to see.

Kiryu: What did he say?

[Police sirens are heard from afar.]

Kawara: …That was quick.

Kaoru: The police are on high alert.

Kawara: We can’t stay here… We’ll talk later.

Kiryu: Let’s join Date-san at the bar.

[They go outside the clinic.]

Kiryu: Date’s waiting at a bar called Bantam.

Kaoru: Let’s move, then.

Kawara: Sorry, but you guys go ahead. I can’t walk around looking like this. I’ll need to find a change of pants.

Kaoru: You gonna be okay on your own?

Kawara: I’ll be fine. See you guys at Bantam.

Kiryu: All right.

[Kiryu and Kaoru walk to Bantam.]

Date: Oh, you’re back.

Kiryu: Yeah… Where’s the barkeep?

Date: He stepped out. Took you long enough, though.

Kawara: Yeah, but we got ourselves a lead.

Date: What sort of lead?

Kawara: A couple of heavies came after Kazuki, and we made them cough up a name.

[He pushes his notebook to Date with handwritten 真拳派.]

Date: True Fist Faction…?

Kawara: In Korean, true is "jin," fist is “gweon," and the character for faction is read, “pa.” But that’s a Japanese reading.

Date: So Jingweon Mafia… A Korean mafia?

Kawara: Without a doubt.

Kaoru: I’ve never heard of them before.

Kawara: I’d be surprised if you had. They’re not like Japan’s yakuza. This is a mafia we’re talking about. They’re not gonna wear flashy pins. The name’s just a label anyway. They couldn’t care less about it. What they do care about… is absolute loyalty.

Kiryu: So this Jingweon Mafia kidnapped Daigo and Chairman Goda?

Date: Yeah, that’s what it looks like.

Kaoru: Good thing you understand Korean, then.

Kawara: I picked up a little…

Date: I don’t think we’re safe here. We should head out soon.

Kiryu: Why do you say that?

Date: I think they’re onto this place, if you ask me.

Kiryu: You’re serious?

Date: The barkeep’s been acting strange… He keeps coming and going. Like he’s talking to someone. And…

Kawara: And what?

Date: Seems like he’s after you, too.

Kaoru: Me…?

Date: These pictures were behind the bar.

Kaoru: Why would he have these?

[It’s a photo of Kaoru and Kiryu.]

Kiryu: Let me handle this one. I’ll ask him about it. (to Kaoru) You take Date-san and Kawara-san back to Serena.

Kaoru: All right.

[Kawara, Date and Kaoru leave the bar. Some time later the barkeep returns.]

Bartender: Hm? Kiryu-san, you’re back.

Kiryu: Barkeep, know anything about these photos?

Bartender: Th-Those…

Kiryu: Come on, barkeep. We go back more than a year. I would never want to cause you any trouble. But can you at least tell me what’s going on?

Bartender: I-It’s not that…

Kiryu: Who put you up to this?

Bartender: Uh, no, I…

[Three armed men burst into the bar.]

Cook: He leaves us no choice, barkeeper. This is the only way!

Bartender: Kiryu-san… Please let us kill you! We beg you…!

[Kiryu finishes his drink and fights the citizens of Kamurocho. Despite the fact that they are armed with bats, he handles them easily.]

Bartender: I’m so sorry! After what happened last year, we lost our whole clientele. We’re so deep in debt…

Kiryu: You borrowed dirty money?

Bartender: The banks were turning me away at the door… There were loan sharks hounding me every day… Then out of nowhere, a guy showed up and offered to pay it all off…

Kiryu: Who’s making offers like that?

Bartender: He said he was from the Sengoku Family… Then he gave me those photos.

Kiryu: So he put a bounty on our heads.

Bartender: I’m afraid so. I was at a loss… But… Against the wall like that, what choice did I have? So, please –

Kiryu: Hey, it’s fine.

Bartender: Huh?

Kiryu: Last year… was mostly my fault.

Bartender: Wha? B-But…

Kiryu: I’ll take care of all of this. Just hold on a little longer. Until then, I want you to stay put. Keep serving fine drinks to fine people.

Bartender: Kiryu-san…

Kiryu: Knowing you have a place to make part of your daily routine… That’s your soul’s salvation in a city like this. So… don’t just throw this place away.

Bartender: (bows) Thank you!

[Kiryu leaves the bar.]

Kiryu: (Everyone’s waiting for me at Serena.)

[He goes back to Serena.]

Date: Hey, you’re back.

Kaoru: So, was it the Omi Alliance pulling the strings?

Kiryu: Yeah, Sengoku. Took advantage of the barkeep’s financial woes.

Kaoru: Oh.

Kiryu: (to Date) What’s wrong? Did something happen?

Date: Kiryu… Things just took an ugly turn. The Amano Building shooting… Apparently I’m wanted for murder.

Kiryu: How can that be?

Kawara: Surveillance cameras picked up Makoto firing his gun.

Chapter 8: SUSPECT
[Some high ranked police official watch the security footage with Sudo and Kurahashi.]

Police Official: Any way you look at it, Date shot him.

Sudo: Something’s off about this though!

Police Official: (shows a bullet) We found this on the scene. Forensics confirms it came from his pistol.

Sudo: As I’ve explained, he was contracting for us on a classified investigation…

Police Official: Ex-cop or not civilians have no business carrying firearms.

Sudo: True enough, but consider his record here. Pinning down the group that bombed the Millennium Tower would’ve been tough without him.

Police Official: So who is this group you’re pursuing?

Kurahashi: The Jingweon Mafia.

Police Official: Jingweon Mafia? That’s absurd. They were annihilated years ago.

Kurahashi: No… Foreign Affairs has been watching them for six months. We have a resurgence of Jingweon survivors in Kamurocho.

Police Official: Is that reliable information?

Kurahashi: Yes. The man we’d marked was the owner of the Stardust host club. Evidence suggested he was one of them.

Police Official: Then why didn’t Foreign Affairs perform a standard investigation?

Sudo: Kazuki is a cautious man, and sharp. Chief Kurahashi suggested we bring in Date-san due to his familiarity with Kazuki.

Police Official: I can see the logic… But here’s the result of that. We’ll need to arrest Date.

Sudo: Arrest him!?

Police Official: Imagine this going public. An ex-cop scandal would have the media tripping over itself. I want Date brought in immediately.

Sudo: Please, sir, wait!

Police Official: Effective immediately. Division One is taking command of this investigation. The Jingweon investigation too. Foreign Affairs and Division Four are off the case. Are we clear?

Sudo: …Yes sir.

Kurahashi: Understood.

Police Official: That’s all then.

[He leaves the room.]

Sudo: Chief Kurahashi…

Kurahashi: I know. I’m responsible for what happened to Date-san. I’ll think of something…

[Back to Serena…]

Kaoru: That video doesn’t show half of what happened up there.

Kawara: Yeah, but headquarters doesn’t know that.

Kaoru: Even so, how is that footage enough to incriminate him?

Kawara: This department relies on video footage to verify everything these days.

Kaoru: I’m the one who shot him. I’ll turn in my gun and give a statement.

Kawara: Don’t bother. Reality is, they threw a civilian into a classified investigation, even if he is an ex-cop. And Makoto’s bullet from the crime scene is all the "ammo" they need. They’d take your smoking gun and just bury it.

Kiryu: Did that footage come from the Florist?

Kawara: Most likely.

Date: Then we need to hunt down the Jingweon, fast.

Kawara: Still, if you stay in Kamurocho, it’s only a matter of time until they arrest you. You should probably skip town.

Date: (to Kiryu) What’s your plan, then?

Kiryu: Track down Daigo, then start looking for the Jingweon Mafia from there.

Date: Track him down how?

Kiryu: I think I’m gonna need to pay him a visit.

Date: The Florist?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Date: I’ll give you a call if I find anything.

[Kawara and Date leave the room.]

Kaoru: We need to dig up what we can on the Jingweon Mafia, right away. For Date-san’s sake too…

Kiryu: Yeah. Our best bet right now is the Florist. He’s apparently up in the Millennium Tower now.

Kaoru: Yeah. Let’s head over.

Go to the Millennium Tower
[They run to the Tower and find out that the entrance is blocked by the police.]

Police Officer: No one’s allowed beyond this point.

Kaoru: (shows her badge) It’ll be fine. I’m on your side.

Police Officer: Oh? M-My apologies, ma’am!

[Kiryu and Kaoru enter the Tower.]

Kaoru: Is this the place?

Kiryu: Yeah. On the 50th floor. The elevators are up ahead.

[They go up to the 50th floor. They are greeted by the Florist in a police uniform. He sits behind a giant video surveillance system.]

The Florist: Haven’t seen you in a while, Kiryu.

Kiryu: I see you’ve gone from underground hideout to high-profile luxury suite… You always were full of surprises.

The Florist: Lovely young lady you’ve got there.

Kiryu: She’s a detective with Osaka’s Division Four.

The Florist: Kaoru Sayama-san, correct?

Kaoru: How’d you know my name?

The Florist: Passed the Tier 10 Public Service Exam at 20 while in technical college. Joined the Osaka Prefectural Police on that career track with a state recommendation. Entered Division Four where, as of this April… You set a record by getting promoted to assistant inspector in four years. Following said promotion, you made Division Four lead detective. AKA, the "Yakuza Huntress." I leave anything out?

Kaoru: How’d you know all that?

The Florist: I’ve tracked pretty much all of your activity since you got to Kamurocho. I just did a little homework on the side.

Kiryu: Impressive as ever.

The Florist: Yeah, well.

Kiryu: Then you already know why we’re here.

The Florist: Yeah, I’ve got a guess. This Daigo Dojima issue?

Kiryu: Yeah. Daigo’s kidnappers led me to the Amano Building…

The Florist: And that landed you in a shootout. You’re wrapped up in a real mess, huh?

Kaoru: Date-san said the video the police are using as evidence came from you.

The Florist: It’s true… That was pure bad luck. The way the camera was angled, you could only see Date and Kazuki.

Kiryu: As a result, he’s a murder suspect now.

The Florist: I know. I feel guilty.

Kaoru: Hm? How so?

The Florist: If I’d seen it first… I never would have handed over a tape so full of holes as evidence. Not that it means anything now, but it was submitted behind my back.

Kiryu: What are you implying?

The Florist: In short… I’ve got a rat problem here.

Kaoru: A spy?

The Florist: I can’t say for sure, but take the bombing that happened upstairs. I should have seen that one from a mile away. Yet none of the relevant data ever came through here.

Kaoru: So someone’s sneaking around, filtering your data from the inside?

The Florist: We’ve got eyes on Kamurocho 24 hours a day here. But even I’ve gotta sleep sometimes. And when the cat’s away, the rats will play.

Kiryu: Any idea who this rat is?

The Florist: No. The team here is made up of all my old buddies from Purgatory. Hard to imagine any of them could be a turncoat…

Security Camera Guy: Boss! I’ve got a visual on our man!

The Florist: Push it to the main monitor!

[Two men on video pouches someone out of a car.]

Kiryu: Was that Daigo?

The Florist: Yeah. Figured I’d get a jump on tracking him before you showed up. Pinpoint that location!

Security Camera Guy: Taihei Boulevard! The building is —

[The lights go off.]

The Florist: What’s going on!?

Security Camera Guy: The power’s down!

The Florist: Why though!?

Security Camera Guy: Looks like trouble in the transformer room! We’ll switch over to the backup system!

The Florist: The whole building’s power comes from the transformer room.

Security Camera Guy 2: Boss! Intruders in the transformer room! I’ll put ’em on the monitor now!

[Some guys in masks crushing transformers with sledgehammers.]

The Florist: Who are these fools? How many we got!?

Security Camera Guy 2: Eight, sir!

Kiryu: Where is that room!?

The Florist: Basement, B10. You going to do your thing?

Kiryu: Yeah. They’re stopping me from getting Daigo’s location.

[He and Kaoru enter the transformer room. Kiryu punches the mysterious intruders to the floor without even saying hi. The last one comes from the shadows afterwards.]

Kaoru: …And he makes eight.

Kiryu: Right. He’s the last one.

[The intruder takes off his mask. It’s Hiroshi Hayashi, an Omi assassin from the first game.]

Kiryu: …You!

Hayashi: (in Kiryu’s memory) Kiryu-han, be a pal and hand the girl over. Killin’ a guy like you in a place like this would be a cryin’ shame. Do it! Boys… Kill ’im!

Kaoru: Who is he?

Kiryu: Hayashi, of the Omi Alliance.

Kaoru: Omi!?

Kiryu: Why are you doing this?

Hayashi: These days I work for Ryuji-san. I got nothin’ to do with Omi proper anymore.

Kiryu: What? So he sent you here to slow us down?

Hayashi: (laughs) His reasons ain’t my business. All I got was orders from the man to bust this room up.

Kaoru: I remember now… A year ago, the name "Hayashi" was struck from our list of Omi officers. Figures that he’d go crawling to the Go-Ryu Clan…

Hayashi: You the lady detective they call the Yakuza Huntress, miss?

Kaoru: That’s Detective Sayama. Division Four.

Hayashi: Wow, a stand-up cop like you gettin’ cozy with a former yakuza chairman? Crazy, right?

Kaoru: Don’t get cocky now! Breaking and entering, destruction of property… Add resisting arrest if you give us any more lip. You’re in it deep.

Hayashi: That a threat? It don’t mean much to a man who already gave up everything.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Hayashi: Hayashi of the Omi Alliance is dead and gone. Seein’ Ryuji-san rise to the top… I’m makin’ it happen… Even if it means goin’ to prison or worse!

[Kiryu fights him and wins.]

Hayashi: You’re still a beast… Kiryu…

Kaoru: I had no idea Ryuji’s band had officer-level guys like Hayashi…

Kiryu: Yeah, and sending him here is a clear sign.

Kaoru: (pulls a lever) Well, that takes care of the power.

Kiryu: Good. Let’s head back up.

[They return to The Florist.]

Security Camera Guy: Boss! The system’s coming back up!

The Florist: Good. Give her some juice! I want eyes on Daigo Dojima!

Security Camera Guy: Yes sir!

Security Camera Guy 2: Boss!

The Florist: An error?

Security Camera Guy: No… We’re being hacked!

The Florist: What the hell!?

Kiryu: What’s wrong?

The Florist: Somebody’s hacked into the system to block our access.

Kiryu: Another Go-Ryu surprise?

The Florist: If how it looks is how it is, then yeah.

[Programmers fight begins! It’s pretty obvious what the rat is Security Camera Guy 2 and he fights with Security Camera Guy for control of the system.]

Security Camera Guy: Damn… They’re fast! I can’t keep up!

Kaoru: Allow me.

Security Camera Guy: Huh?

Kaoru: Move it! Okay then…

Kiryu: …Wow.

[Kaoru types something without understanding the system she’s on. And of course she beat the professional that built the system.]

Security Camera Guy: Unreal!

The Florist: I guess it figures.

Kiryu: Figures how?

The Florist: What, you didn’t know? Sayama’s actually in her element here.

Kiryu: Her element?

The Florist: My file on her says she mastered programming at tech school. That’s how she landed the job on the force. She came in as an engineer for the high-tech crime unit under Foreign Affairs.

Kiryu: High-tech crime unit…

The Florist: Right, they’re desk jockeys who track internet crimes and all that Sayama tested for the Tier II career track. But she was hired as a specialist, and you’re looking at it.

Kiryu: So, how’d she wind up in Organized Crime?

The Florist: She applied in person right after she got placed. Probably planned on going to Division Four from the get-go.

Kiryu: Why Division Four…?

The Florist:Hey, all I’ve got is her file. My cameras can’t see inside her head.

Kaoru: Whoever he is, he’s good. Ooh, gotchya.

[She returns the control of the cameras to the Florist.]

Kiryu: That was impressive.

Security Camera Guy: I’ve got a fix on Daigo Dojima!

The Florist: Where?

Security Camera Guy: Taihei Boulevard, sir! A room in the Shangri-La!

The Florist: Shangri-La!?

Kaoru: You know it?

Kiryu: Yeah… I was there last year. (to the Florist) I owe you one.

The Florist: All things considered around here, they’re gonna know you’ve found him.

Kiryu: The only reason they’d bring him to Kamurocho at all is to bait me.

The Florist: Probably a safe assumption. You be careful out there.

Kiryu: I will.

[Kiryu and Kaoru leaves.]

The Florist: An ex-yakuza and a Division Four cop… Helluva pair.

[Kiryu and Kaoru approach a spooky looking house.]

Kaoru: This is the place?

Kiryu: Yeah.

[They enter the house.]

Kiryu: (The place is trashed. Majima-san, the truck was a little much…)

Kaoru: Hey, this place is creepy. Let’s hurry up and find this guy.

Kiryu: It’s probably dangerous to even move through there. Let me handle this one. If I make it through, we’ll know it’s safe.

Kaoru: …All right. I’m not too keen on being buried in rubble anyway.

Find Daigo
[Kiryu rushes through the house kicking yakuza ass. In one of the rooms he find his friend with a couple of yakuza guarding him.]

Kiryu: Give him back or else.

[He and Kaoru defeat Go-Ryu Clan yakuzas. After that Kiryu unties Daigo.]

Daigo: Thanks… They took Chairman Goda someplace else. …Sorry.

Kiryu: No, I’m sorry I took so long to get here. You okay?

Daigo: Not really… I’m dying here.

Kiryu: What’s wrong? What’d they break?

Daigo: That’s not it… I’m fuckin’ starving, man.

Kiryu: I think you’re gonna pull through.

Majima Saga - Chapter 2: PRODIGAL SON
[Majima tells that happened to Uematsu to the chairman and other patriarchs at the next meeting.]

Ibuchi: This incident we have… Care to explain yourself, Majima-san?

Majima: Nothin’ to explain, actually. I went in and found Uematsu dead. All there is to it.

Ibuchi: Majima-san and Uematsu were rivals for the clan captain’s seat. And it’s purely coincidence, then, that Majima-san discovered his corpse?

Majima: Somethin’ you’re gettin’ at? If ya got somethin’ to say, spit it out.

Ibuchi: I’m saying that Uematsu’s death… Was probably by your own hand!

Kashiwagi: Enough with the absurd speculation! What proof do you have that Majima did it!?

Ibuchi: None, at the moment. But I’m sure it’s only a matter of time until I do. Uematsu was Majima-san’s only obstacle for the captain’s chair. He has a clear motive for the murder. They call Majima-san the "mad dog" for a reason… I wouldn’t put it past him. Shall we end this charade? ough to watch the old guard stumble to cover for each other.

Kashiwagi: You son of a…!

Majima: Kashiwagi-san! It’s cool.

Kashiwagi: Majima..

Majima: I get real tired real quick of guys who talk in circles… So I think I’m gonna bail on this stupid little tea party of yours. You gonna stop yappin’ if I bring ya the head of Uematsu’s killer?

Ibuchi: Yes, of course. If you can, that is.

[Majima leaves the meeting and the building.]

Uematsu Family Member: You kept us waiting, Majima.

Majima: Uematsu’s strays, I take it?

Uematsu Family Member: You thought we were gonna just sit in the office and mourn? We won’t be satisfied until you don’t have a pulse!

Majima: (pulls out his tanto and laughs) Nice… At least Uematsu raised his boys up right!

[He kicks their asses.]

Uematsu Family Member: Damn… Too strong…

Majima: Yeah, learned any lessons today? I can take six guys with my good eye shut. Didn’t ya figure that out when ya jumped me in Kamurocho?

Uematsu Family Member: In… Kamurocho? What do you mean? That wasn’t us, man…

Majima: Eh?

Kashiwagi: Majima! Are these guys Uematsu Family? Idiots! You attacked him with no evidence to suggest he even did it!?

Majima: It’s cool, Kashiwagi. Their boss just took a bullet… Can’t blame ’em for wantin’ to take out some pent-up aggression.

Kashiwagi: Hmm… Then what’s your next move, Majima?

Majima: Eh, I figured I’d just start smackin’ up every thug this side of town. Rattle enough skulls, you’re bound to hit the right one eventually.

Kashiwagi: I should have expected as much… Here… This might help.

Majima: What’s this?

Kashiwagi: The name and location of a legendary information dealer… The Florist of Sai.

Majima: What’s he gonna have for me, a pretty bouquet?

Kashiwagi: That and every bit of info you could ask for. If it happens in Kamurocho, he’ll know. At the very least, there’s no harm in starting there.

Majima: Yeah, less bloody that way too. Much obliged, Kashiwagi-san.

Kashiwagi: We need your attention on the clan. The Tojo Clan is on a precipice here. Find the real culprit. Clear your name and any doubt from Terada and his lackeys.

Majima: Can’t say I honestly give a damn about Terada and his circus monkeys. I ain’t gonna complicate this. I wanna find the guy who set me up and dislocate a few bones.

Kashiwagi: This whole thing stinks, Majima… Be careful out there.

Majima: (So this legendary informant hangs out at the top of the Millennium Tower? Talk about hidin’ in plain sight. Guess I’ll drop in.)

[He goes to Kamurocho, finds the Tower and goes up to the 50th floor.]

The Florist: Yo. I knew you’d come, Goro Majima.

Majima: Oh yeah? Nothin’ gets past you, eh? That business ’bout you bein’ a legendary informant’s true, I take it.

The Florist: If I couldn’t keep tabs on a guy who dresses like you… I’d have no business doing what I do here. All the same, I’ll ask. What are you here to find out?

Majima: The truth behind this whole mess, of course. If I’m bein’ set up by some schemin asshole… Then I’m not chillin’ out ’til I find and crush the fool.

The Florist: Considering how hot this is… The details won’t come cheap.

Majima: All good. For once, I’ve got a barrel fulla cash. How much?

The Florist: Nope. I’m not taking cash on this one. I’ll sell you this in exchange for a single favor. How’s that sound?

Majima: Hm. Kinda depends on the favor.

The Florist: I used to run this place called Purgatory before I came up here. I want you to take over operations.

Majima: Purgatory…?

The Florist: You enter from a bathroom in West Park. It’s like an underground city. I used to have my "office" down there. It’s got anything you could desire. From gambling to an underground fighting ring.

Majima: Hoho… Now you’re speakin’ my language.

The Florist: Well… It’s been getting neglected, for obvious reasons. I want someone I can trust to take care of it.

Majima: I ain’t the kinda guy you can trust.

The Florist: Who I can trust or not is my call to make… Not yours. So? Are my terms agreeable?

Majima: Heh, fine, long as this ends with punchin’. Takin’ care of a few layers of Purgatory won’t slow me down.

The Florist: I’d say we have a deal, then.

[He pushes a button. The videos on all the screens change.]

Majima: Whoa, what the!?

The Florist: It’s all in the job. My intersection on the information super highway of Kamurocho. Now, let’s pull up Uematsu’s untimely demise. Give that monitor a look.

Majima: Wait a minute, that’s me!

The Florist: Yeah. Let’s start from where you raided the Uematsu office. And if we rewind a bit…

Majima: That’s… Kawamura!? Why would he..!?

The Florist: Who knows? You’ll have to ask him yourself. Not like I can record what’s in someone’s head. Where you headed?

Majima: My only option! Back to my office! Kawamura has some explainin’ to do!

The Florist: Sorry, but he’s not in Kamurocho anymore.

Majima: Then where is he!?

The Florist: In Sotenbori.

Majima: Sotenbori…?

[Majima returns to his cradle, to his prison… Sotenbori.]

Majima: Back here of all places…

(Let’s just focus on findin’ Kawamura. Best place to round up info here is probably… Well, shit. This blows. But ya gotta do what ya gotta do.)

=Go to the Cabaret Grand=
Club Grand Waiter: Welcome to the Grand, sir! Is this your first visit, sir?

Majima: Uh… First time as a guest…

Club Grand Waiter: Any particular hostess you’d like to request, then?

Majima: Nah… Just set me up with whoever’s popular with young assholes.

Club Grand Waiter: O-Oh, yes sir…

Majima: Don’t sweat it, I got money to burn.

Club Grand Waiter: Huh? Er… Yes, sir, understood!

[He sits on a couch with a hostess.]

Hostess: Hello, sir! Would ya like to start with a cocktail?

Majima: Nah, let’s jump straight to the best bottle in the house.

Hostess: Really? You mean that?

Majima: Sure. That’ll be a nice chunk of change for ya, right? But I’m hopin’ you’ll indulge me on this burnin’ question I got in exchange.

Hostess:  Oh, no problem! How can I help ya?

Majima: (shows a photo of Kawamura) Just wanna know if you’ve seen this guy around.

Hostess: Hm? Oh, can’t say that I have… Or at least, he’s not been at my table. I figured a girl like you might have the

Majima: That so… I figured a girl like you might have the inside scoop…

Hostess: Hmm… Well, I’ll tell ya what, I’ll ask around with the other girls.

Majima: You’d do that for me?

Hostess: Sure! The crowds are light today. They’ll have enough time. Besides, a guy who orders a bottle at these prices deserves a little TLC.

Majima: Heh, give my regards to your manager, I’ll leave ya to it.

[Some time later she returns with a girl.]

Hostess: Sir, I think Ayumi-chan here might have a lead for you.

Ayumi: (bows) It’s a pleasure to meet you, sir.

Hostess: That guy in the picture… Ayumi-chan recognized him.

Majima: Did ya now?

Ayumi: I did, I did! Kawamura, right? We went to the same junior high. But to be honest, he hung out with a rough crowd, so I avoided him most of the time.

Majima: Well, I happen to be lookin’ for the rascal. Ya heard anything more recent?

Ayumi: Um… Only bad news… It sounds like he had some debt problems.

Majima: Debt collectors, eh?

Ayumi: Yeah, I guess he’s a bit of a gambler. He was in town askin’ some of my friends if he could borrow money. But they weren’t dumb. They knew they’d never see that money again.

Majima: Smart girls.

Ayumi: So I guess he borrowed money from the local yakuza, and… Well, interest rates and all… It sounded like he was runnin’ from some guys I wouldn’t mess with.

Majima: I’m gettin’ the picture… Anythin’ else come to mind?

Ayumi: Hm, not really… Sorry I couldn’t be of more help.

Majima: Nah, you’ve been a doll. Here, would ya mind callin’ me if anything comes up? I get the feelin’ it will.

Ayumi: Sure! You’re trying to help him, right?

Majima: (So Kawamura was carryin’ debt, huh? I just gotta figure out how that connects to Uematsu… Better hit the town and see what I can dig up.)

[He walks out of Grand. Five men in black suits approach Majima.]

Majima: Hm? Ya knew I’d come, eh? Must mean I’m getting closer to the guy you boys work for… But if ya think ya got the drop on me… You’re dead wrong!

[Majima cuts through them.]

Majima: (I gotta get to the bottom of this shit. If the Grand was a bust, maybe I’ll try my luck at Odyssey. …Assumin’ the place is still standin’. Heh. If memory serves, Odyssey is in South Shofukucho.)

=Go to Odyssey=
[Majima runs to South Shofukucho, but only finds a place called Andromeda.]

Majima: (This is where Odyssey woulda been… So much for that!)

[He walks a couple of stems and sees an advertisement.]

Majima: (Four Shine? Heh, the ol’ club’s got copycats now? Guess the cabaret club business is still boomin’.)

[A man named Yamagata walks down the stairs towards Majima.]

Yamagata: Well, that was miserable. They’ve got a year, tops..

Majima: Whoa. I know you. You’re the old manager of the Odyssey. Yamagata-han?

Yamagata: Yours isn’t a face I’d forget either. Well, well, Majima of the Grand. You disappeared so fast, I was sure you’d gotten erased. To what do we owe the pleasure of your triumphant return?

Majima: Nothin’ so grandiose. I’m just lookin’ for a guy. Thought I’d pop into the Odyssey to get some intel, but it seems to have gone belly-up.

Yamagata: Right. It wasn’t sustainable with the numbers it was pulling in. But that’s all in the past. Maybe I can help?

Majima: Maybe. Know this guy? (shows the photo)

Yamagata: Hmm…

Majima: That a yes?

Yamagata: Not by name, but I’ve shared a table with the man. He’s a mahjong addict. Any time of day I went there, I’d see him. Even sat at his table a few times. Not a bad player for a kid.

Majima: Mahjong, huh?

Yamagata: Yes, but that parlor’s gone now too. It’s been maybe a few years since they shut their doors. Outdated info like that probably isn’t much use, is it? Sorry.

Majima: Nah, it’s enough. But that mahjong parlor… Where was it?

Yamagata: A little deeper south in Shofukucho. Above a massage parlor named "Hogushi Kaikan."

Majima: Hogushi Kaikan!?

Yamagata: Yes, remember that explosion back in the ‘80s? It closed down after that… But then it re-open the following year. Who knows? Maybe the staff there could tell you something. Your buddy there… When he had a good day at the tables, he’d go downstairs and get a massage.

Majima: Would he, now. I owe ya one, Yamagata-han.

Yamagata: Ha, hardly. Yesterday’s foes are tomorrow’s friends. Don;t be a stranger, Majima-han.

Majima: Heh, maybe.

[Yamagata leaves.]

Majima: (Hogushi Kaikan, huh… Let’s get this over with.)

[The two girls who are familiar to us are quietly watching him…]

Koyuki: Huh? He left!

Yuki: You sure you saw him?

Koyuki: Yes! There was a creepy man with an eyepatch just down there! I wanted to yell at him to move along, but I was too scared…

Yuki: Hmm… You think he was sent to intimidate us? Eh, doesn’t matter. He’s gone now.

Koyuki: That’s true.

Yuki: Come on, let’s go back inside.

Koyuki: Yeah.

[She walks away.]

Yuki: A creepy guy… wearing an eyepatch? …Nahhh. No way.

[Meanwhile Majima has no trouble finding an important place from his past - Hogushi Kaikan ほぐし快館 (approximate translation - Relaxation Center).]

Majima: (So they rebuilt Hogushi Kaikan, eh? Kinda the last place I wanna be… But a lead’s a lead, right? No other way around this… Okay, good talk. Let’s just do this!)

[He gets inside.]

Majima: It’s hardly changed at all…

Nurse: Welcome! Right this way, sir! Which course would you like?

Majima: Ah, actually, I just have a question for ya. I heard this guy was a regular in here…

Nurse: Ohhh! Kawamura-kun, right? I used to do his massages all the time.

Majima: Really!?

Nurse: Yes, although I haven’t seen him here in a year or so.

Majima: A year, huh? That’s about the time he joined up with me… Well y’see, he’s in a bit of trouble, so I gotta find him. Anything helps! Can ya tell me when ya saw him last?

Nurse: Hmmm… Oh! Actually… The last day he was in the store, he said somethin’ strange…

Majima: Strange, huh?

Nurse: Yes, Kawamura-kun was always playin’ mahjong upstairs… But on that last day, he was really excited, talkin’ about being free of his debts…

Majima: He cleared his debt?

Nurse: Yes, he said he’d met someone who would shoulder the whole thing… And that he’d be going to Kamurocho with him, so he wouldn’t be back…

Majima: So his savior took him out to Kamurocho?

Nurse: I didn’t know people even did that kinda thing! Made me a little jealous.

Majima: Anythin’ else come to mind?

Nurse: Hmm… It was pretty long ago… Sorry.

Majima: Nah, you’ve helped a ton. Thanks, lady!

Nurse: Oh but sir, which course would you like?

Majima: Huh? Oh, I don’t need a massage.

Nurse: What!? Won’t you get a massage while you’re here, sir!? Or did you put me through all that for nothing? After I broke every privacy protection rule in the book, too!

Majima: Tch, alright, alright! Gimme the quickest, shortest course ya got.

Nurse: Great! The 30 minute course, then! Tateyama-san’s the best in our store! Will she work for you, sir?

Majima: I don’t care either way, so up to you.

Nurse: Sure! We’ll get set up for you, sir! Please undress and wait here.

[Some time later Majima is laying on the table.]

Nurse: Tateyama-san, can you take the customer in number one?

[An unexpected person enters the room!!!]

Makoto: Good afternoon! I’ll be your masseuse today. I’m Makoto Tateyama. Nice to meet you, sir.

[Majima slowly turns his head, gets shocked and hides his face.]

Chapter 9: THE OMI INVASION
[Kiryu, Daigo and Kaoru talking at Serena.]

Daigo: The way they moved and handled their guns… They’re not just some gang. They were more like a military.

Kiryu: That good?

[Kashiwagi bursts in.]

Kashiwagi: You okay, Daigo!?

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san!

Kashiwagi: You’re not hurt, are you?

Daigo: Sorry… I couldn’t protect Chairman Goda.

Kashiwagi: I heard. Don’t worry about it. You’re alive, that’s all that matters now. (offers him a cigarette) So, any clue who’s responsible for kidnapping you and Chairman Goda?

Daigo: I didn’t get much… But… they called themselves "The Jingweon."

Kashiwagi: You’re sure? The Jingweon Mafia?

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san, you’ve heard of them?

Kashiwagi: Yeah… But the Jingweon I know were wiped out.

Kaoru: I called HQ and asked them to search the records. They didn’t even have a record of their existence.

Kashiwagi: That’s because they’ve been erased from the records.

Kaoru: Still, any mafia that big should turn up in police records somewhere.

Kashiwagi: The police are the ones who erased them.

Kaoru: But why?

[He plunges into memories…]

Kashiwagi: It happened over 20 years ago… Back then, the Dojima Family stood against foreign factions all over Kamurocho. Of them, the Korean Jingweon Mafia was our biggest threat. The Dojima Family was already the Tojo Clan’s backbone, but to grow… They needed a definitive strike.

Shimano: So… We doin’ this… boss?

Dojima: Yeah… Wipe ’em all out.

Kazama: All of them!?

Dojima: What? You got a problem with that?

Kazama: No…

Shimano: What, Kazama? A guy with a hundred kills is suddenly shittin’ his pants?

Kazama: That’s not the issue! Boss… Is war really the only option here?

Shimano: The fuck you smokin’, man!? They’re the ones who brought the fight! Kill us, we kill you harder. Welcome to the yakuza!

Dojima: Listen, Kazama… It’s not like I don’t hear you.

Shimano: Boss—

Dojima: C’mon, chill. Still… These Jingweon fucks are different. Their methods are below the belt. If we don’t act, the Dojima Family’s good as done.

Kazama: Still…

Dojima: If we strike, it has to be now. Hit too soft, and we’ve dug our own graves. They have to be wiped out. Am I clear?

Kazama: Yes. But is killing them all really necessary?

Shimano: Damn right! How many of my boys y’think they’ve buried? I wanna choke the life outta every last one of ’em!

Dojima: They’re operating behind a disco here in town. Tonight’s our only chance.

Shimano: Leave ’em to me!

Kazama: …Fine.

Kashiwagi: Kazama-san was against it to the end. But if the boss says white is black, then black it is. In the end, Kazama-san went along with Shimano. They hit the Jingweon base and killed every last man. As a result, the Dojima Family took back Kamurocho, and became its de facto force. Not long after, Shimano split off to form his own family.

Daigo: So that’s how the Dojima Family came to power…

Kashiwagi: And not just the Dojima Family. The Tojo Clan used that momentum to spread all over Kanto.

Daigo: But if that’s all true, shouldn’t the Jingweon have been eradicated?

Kashiwagi: They were. The Jingweon Mafia was wiped out. But… Maybe this means some of them lived after all.

Kaoru: Survivors of the raid?

Daigo: That would mean those survivors have allied with the Go-Ryu Clan.

Kiryu: Right.

Kaoru: But… While all this was happening, where were the police?

Kashiwagi: The police didn’t have a solid lead on the Jingweon at the time. So they let the Dojima Family do their jobs for them.

Kaoru: Meaning… They turned a blind eye?

Kashiwagi: That’s about the size of it. You’d have to ask the detective on the case for the details.

Kaoru: Oh really? You got a name?

Kashiwagi: I don’t remember his name. Like I said… It’s been over 20 years…

Kaoru: Oh.

Kashiwagi: This is a hell of a mess… Chairman Goda is still captive out there… The Go-Ryu have their sights on Kamurocho… And now the ghost of the Jingweon Mafia…

Kiryu: Plus the rat that set up Date-san.

Kashiwagi: It’s a crowded board… Who’s going to make the next move?

Daigo: (puts out a cigarette) Doesn’t matter. Any way it goes down… We’ve got to beat it.

[Kiryu walks to Kashiwagi to talk to him.]

Kashiwagi: Tomorrow is Fifth Chairman Terada’s funeral service. Lady Dojima has been heading up the arrangement.

Kiryu: I see. I’ll be there, then. I’d like to pay my final respect too.

Kashiwagi: Of course. I’ll be a bit late, but I’ll be there too. Once you’re settled in at HQ, make sure you update Lady Dojima on everything.

Kiryu: I will.

Kashiwagi: Thanks, Kiryu.

[He leaves. Kiryu walks to talk to Sayama.]

Kaoru: Sounds like tomorrow’s another busy day. Shall we call it a night?

Kiryu: You’re right… Let’s get some rest.

Kaoru: All right. Plan on getting woken up bright and early.

Kiryu: Thanks.

[The next day.]

Kaoru: Mornin’. You’re going to the fifth chairman’s funeral today, yeah? I’ll use the time to touch base with Osaka PD. I’ll be out for a while.

Kiryu: Take your time.

Kaoru: I’m sure I don’t have to say it… but try to stay out of trouble, okay?

Kiryu: Yeah, I’ll do my best. I’ll call you when I get back.

Kaoru: Now you’re getting it.

Kiryu: (I’ll catch a cab when I’m ready to head to the funeral.)

Go to Tojo Clan Headquarters
[Kiryu changes clothes, catches a cab and goes to the Tojo Clan’s office. He enters the memorial room with the coffin.]

Kiryu: (Terada… It’s just like when I lost Kazama-san. I’m left here to wonder how it was you and not me. I guess I’ve got more to accomplish first.)

[The ceremony begins.]

Yayoi: (to Daigo) If the Jingweon Mafia and the Go-Ryu Clan really are working together… There’ll be no avoiding bloodshed.

Kiryu: Our first priority is finding Chairman Goda.

Daigo: If we establish the alliance, the Go-Ryu get their hands tied.

[Voices come from the next room.]

Yakuza: Hey! Who the hell are they!?

Yakuza 2: What the fuck!?

[Kiryu, Daigo and Yayoi run there. The patriarch of the Nishiyama Family smiles.]

Kiryu: (What the hell is going on!?)

[He runs out into the courtyard.]

Daigo: What the hell is this?

[A lot of black Mercedes drive into the courtyard, out of which the Yakuza come out.]

Daigo: Go-Ryu scum!?

Yakuza Boss: Step aside, dinky! We meet again, Kiryu-han.

Kiryu: You’re not taking another step further.

Yakuza Boss: Ryuji-san ain’t here today. So me n’ the boys came to bury yer sorry ass! Wreck ’im!

[Kiryu and Daigo crush them. For Daigo though the fight appears to be not that easy. He falls on one knee.]

Yayoi: Daigo!

Kashiwagi: The Go-Ryu Clan?

Kiryu: Yeah.

[New cars are coming up. Ryuji gets out of one of them in a traditional Japanese costume.]

Daigo: Ryuji Goda!

Ryuji: Mornin’, Kiryu-han.

Kiryu: Who starts a fight in the middle of a funeral?

Ryuji: My boys get so damn fired up sometimes… I tell ’em to cool it, but it’s in one ear, out the next. It ain’t right, I know.

Kashiwagi: You dare to show your face here!?

Ryuji: Terada-han did right by me as a kid. Thought I’d come pay my respects.

Kashiwagi: Your "respects" mean less than nothing! Get the hell out!

Ryuji: That’s a helluva scowl ya got there. Who are ya now?

Kashiwagi: Acting clan captain, Kashiwagi.

Ryuji: (claps) No shit!? Here I was thinkin’ ya were with the funeral staff! Well, can ya blame me, considerin’ how thin the Tojo Clan’s lookin’ now? Even yer dead chairman got plucked from the other team. And his replacement’s the ol’ black widow here… Thinkin’ this is what I’m up against, hell, I almost wanna cry.

Daigo: Chairman Terada’s only gone… Because you killed him, asshole!

[Daigo is trying to punch Ryuji, but he easily dodges and kicks him. Daigo falls to the ground.]

Ryuji: C’mon now, bud. Where’d all your spunk go?

Daigo: Son of a bitch… I’ll kill you!

Kiryu: (stops Daigo) Where is Chairman Goda?

Ryuji: Taking a little vacation. Up where the air’s nice and clean.

Daigo: You’re trying to stop the alliance?

Ryuji: ’Course. The world-renowned Omi Alliance and this wobbly-ass clan shakin’ hands? That ain’t level.

Kashiwagi: Bastard… So you came for a fight!?

Ryuji: No, no, no, good sir. For real, I came to offer some incense for Terada-han. My humanity’s as good as yours… And I wouldn’t make trouble at a funeral. This shit’s sacred.

[He snaps his fingers. Two yakuza walks in carrying suitcases full of money.]

Ryuji: Please, with my condolences.

Kashiwagi: We don’t need any Go-Ryu money!

Ryuji: Didn’t the Tojo Clan damn near fall apart over a measly 10 bil last year? If money’s really that tight, I suggest ya scoop it on up.

Yayoi: You think childish taunts like this make you man enough to be the sixth Omi chairman?

Ryuji: You’re really the acting chairman?

Yayoi: Were I in Chairman Goda’s shoes, I’d be the one crying.

Ryuji: Whatchya implyin’ by that, grams?

Yayoi: A parent loves their kids, no matter how far they fall. That said, when your flesh and blood is this rotten, all a parent feels is unrelenting shame!

Ryuji: (laughs) I ain’t the old man’s flesh and blood.

Yayoi: What!?

Ryuji: So fuck off with the "parental love" shit. All we got is lots o’ hate, and it’s mutual. Ya got it rough, bud. Yer ma’s a real battle-axe.

Daigo: Fuck you!

Ryuji: That’s enough fun for today though. I ain’t wanted here, so I’ll see myself out. Oh, right. Three days.

Kiryu: Three days?

Ryuji: Yeah, I’m givin’ us three days to mourn the dead. When the third day’s up, it’s rematch time.

Kiryu: You want a rematch?

Ryuji: Sure do. But if ya don’t wanna beat around the bush, we can settle it now. It’s gonna rain blood over Kamurocho. Which reminds me, wonder what that dirty bastard’s up to? He’s probably here in Kamurocho now, makin’ a big ol’ show of it.

Kiryu: Dirty bastard? Who?

Ryuji: Sengoku.

Kiryu: Sengoku…

[The scene ends. In the next scene several helicopters hover over Kamurocho, confusing the inhabitants. A yakuza gang walks down a Kamurocho street. Majima gets in their way.]

Yakuza Boss: Who the fuck is this clown!?

[Majima pulls out his tanto and attacks the yakuza with a crazy laugh. Meanwhile, Kiryu is walking down the street. His phone rings.]

Kaoru: Hello?

Kiryu: Sayama. Sorry, I got too tied up to call you.

Kaoru: I got the gist of what happened already. The Omi Alliance have launched their attack?

Kiryu: Yeah, Sengoku, specifically.

Kaoru: Wait, just Sengoku? Why?

Kiryu: Can we talk later? There’s a lot going on at the moment.

Kaoru: Where are you?

Kiryu: Near Purgatory.

Kaoru: I’m nearby anyway. Just give me a sec and I’ll be there.

[They meet up.]

Kaoru: So what’s going on?   

Kiryu: All I’ve got to go on at the moment is what Ryuji said.

Kaoru: Wait, Ryuji came out here too?

Kiryu: Yeah. The Go-Ryu attacked Tojo Clan Headquarters. We beat them back, but he said he didn’t even order it… And if what he’s saying is true, then Sengoku’s attack was independent of the Go-Ryu Clan.

Kaoru: Seems like the whole Omi Alliance has gone rogue…

Kiryu: Maybe, but our first priority needs to be pushing Sengoku back.

Kaoru: Right. Let’s hurry.

[Kiryu and Kaoru investigate the city. They find Majima barely alive.]

Kiryu: Majima-san!

Majima: Too late, Kiryu-chan… I already smeared all o’ Sengoku’s girls.

[He falls on the asphalt.]

Kiryu: Majima!

Majima: Promise is a promise, right? I… kept it.

Kiryu: …Yeah.

Majima: As fer you… Ya gotta get back to Tojo HQ!

Kiryu: Why’s that?

Majima: All those ’copters flyin’ around town and these fools marchin’ in… It was all to lure ya out, Kiryu-chan. Their real goal… was HQ. They’re movin’ on it.

Kiryu: You’re serious!?

Majima: Yeah… Sengoku has a rat on the inside… Shindo.

Kiryu: Shindo!?

Majima: That fuckwad… He sold out. So get goin’, Kiryu-chan!

Kaoru: I can take care of him!

[She runs to Majima and holds him.]

Majima: (flirting) Y’know, up close… You’re pretty damn hot. Wanna go out some—

Kaoru: Oh, shut up! No more talking!

Kiryu: He’s in your hands.

Kaoru: Yeah.

Kiryu: (I need to get back to Tojo Clan HQ!)

Go to Tojo Clan Headquarters
[Kiryu runs to Tojo HQ. There’s a lot of bodies in the courtyard and kicks asses of the Nishikiyama Family yakuzas inside. He rushes to the meeting room where some yakuza takas Daigo and Kashiwagi and other patriarchs hostage.]

Yayoi: Don’t think for a second you’ll get away with this!

Shindo: I’m afraid I already have.

Kiryu: Yayoi-san!

Shindo: I got quite a bit done while you were out.

Kiryu: So you’ve sold out to Sengoku?

Shindo: (laughs) As it stands, the Tojo Clan’s on its last legs.

Yayoi: You think a boor like you can shake the Tojo Clan!?

Shindo: No, but what’s that I hear? The sound of the Tojo Clan, changing… As we speak, Sengoku’s hitmen are wiping out the other officers.

Kiryu: What!?

[The scene switches to the three yakuza in the elevator.]

Tojo Clan Boss: Kamurocho may be infested with Sengoku’s men, but today’s the fifth chairman’s funeral. I want all your men to stand down. Is that clear?

Tojo Clan Yakuza: Yes, sir.

[When they get off the elevator, the two killers shoot them with guns. Later, another patriarch of Tojo is killed with a shotgun, and then another is blown up in his own car.]

Kiryu: Have you no shame!? The Tojo Clan stood by you… And you handed it over for money!

Shindo: I never said anything about handing it over. I’m taking over as chairman. And finally… Yayoi-san will be mine.

Yayoi: What do you mean by that!?

Shindo: You know, my lady… I’ve wanted you for a while now!

[He kisses Yayoi and she slaps his mug.]

Shindo: It’s not like you can escape me.

Kiryu: Do you have any idea what you’ve done!?

Shindo: Didn’t you and Patriarch Nishikiyama go to war over a woman just last year? And as a result, the Tojo Clan went all to hell. I guess at the end of the day, we’re both skunks of the same stripe.

Yayoi: It’ll be a cold day in hell before I’d be with you!

Shindo: Patriarch Dojima had a mistress on every corner… I’d make you happier than that toad ever could!

Yayoi: You don’t know a damn thing about him! Even if he did have his women… Sohei Dojima was the only man I ever had eyes for! He may be gone now, but that changes nothing!

Kiryu: Shindo! You heard her. She’s only ever loved the man she fell for. She’s too strong for you.

Shindo: That’s lovely, but let’s cut the crap. What I want, I take by force. It’s just that easy.

Kiryu: Over my dead body…

Shindo: That’s certainly the plan. With your head, I’ll become Tojo Clan chairman. And then… Yayoi-san will be all mine!

[They have an epic fight all over the Tojo HQ! Kiryu slays Shindo with a katana!]

Yayoi: Are you all right?

Kiryu: Yes.

Yayoi: Let’s go check on Daigo and Kashiwagi. Come on.

[They return to the meeting room. Shindo, who appeared to be dead, attacks Kiryu from behind! Kiryu finishes him off with a nifty chair strike!]

Yayoi: Our ties are cut with you! Get the hell out of my sight!

[Barely alive Shindo stretches his arm for a gun… Daigo notices it and quickly shoots the bastard.]

Daigo: Your greed damn near fucked over the clan! Die, you son of a bitch!

[He shots Shindo dead.]

Yayoi: I’m so ashamed… I let a man like Shindo put a blade to my neck…

Kashiwagi: Acting Chairman, my deepest apologies!

Yayoi: It’s not your fault. An outside threat is a visible danger. But when it comes from within, you never see it coming. But listen well, and tell your families. There will be no mercy for any Omi men in Kamurocho. I want them out of our city!

Kiryu, Kashiwagi and Daigo: Understood!

Chapter 10: SURVIVORS
[Date reads some papers in the police archive.]

Date: Here we go. What? The Dojima Family wiped out the Jingweon?

[Kawara enters.]

Kawara: Make any progress, Makoto?

Date: God, Kawara-san… Scared the crap outta me.

Kawara: My bad. I just took a peek outside. No one’s onto you, yet anyway.

Date: Not like Archive 13 gets a whole lot of traffic these days.

Kawara: So you finally hit the Foreign Affairs file. Figured you would.

[Date closes the file he reads. On the cover it says ⎡神室町海外マフィア大量排除⎦に関する報告書 that roughly translates “Report on Overseas Mafia Mass Elimination in Kamurocho.”]

Date: Wait, you knew about this?

Kawara: Yep. Flip to the last page there.

[Date opens the file again and does not turn pages until it finds a table. In the top center column it says 氏名 (Full name). In the left column we can read 警視庁神室署 事件搜查報告 (Office of the Commissioner of Kamuro Metropolitan Police Department, Incident Investigation Report) 昭和五十六年八月十日 (August 10, 1956 (Showa period). In the center column - 瓦 次郎(警视厅搜查一課所属) {Jiro Kawara (member of Police Department’s Division 1)} and 別所 勤(管視序 神室署搜查四課所属) {Tsutomu Bessho (member of Kamuro Police Department’s Division 4)}. And finally in the right column we can read 担当搜查官 (Acting officers).]

Date: You and Bessho-san from Osaka PD!?

Kawara: Right. It was our case.

Date: Lemme guess… This is why you’re on this case now?

Kawara: Yeah. I heard through the grapevine Kurahashi was tracking the Jingweon and volunteered.

Date: Why?

Kawara: I owe them for that case.

Date: Owe them?

[Kawara throws his badge on the table.]

Kawara: Looks like my work here is done. The rest is up to you.

Date: What do you mean?

Kawara: I’m done answering questions.

Date: Kawara-san!

[Kawara walks out of the archive. Date meets Kaoru and Kiryu on some roof.]

Kaoru: The chief was on the original Jingweon case? So the detective Kashiwagi-san mentioned was….

Date: Right. It was Bessho-san.

Kaoru: You’re sure?

Date: Absolutely. His name was right there in the report. And Kawara-san corroborated it.

Kaoru: He never… The chief never even brought it up.

Kiryu: Where’s Kawara-san?

Date: (pulls out Kawara’s badge) He gave me this and dropped off the case.

Kiryu: What does that mean?

Date: I don’t know… But I’m sure the old man knows something. Says he still owes them one.

Kiryu: Owes them? (sees Kaoru’s worried face) What’s wrong?

Kaoru: He lied to me… How could the chief hide this?

Date: The report said he picked up on the Dojima plan while in Kamurocho’s Division Four. But… He looked the other way and allowed it.

Kaoru: In other words, he used the yakuza…

Date: If I had to guess, he figured it was the best way to make Kamurocho safe again. Eventually the brass caught wind of it though, so they booted him down to Osaka.

Kiryu: You should probably bow out too, Date-san. The Jingweon aren’t your average mob. They’re out for blood. Not to mention you’re a wanted man.

Date: You nuts? You think I can just drop this now? Anyway, what’ll you do next?

Kiryu: We still don’t know where Chairman Goda is. I’ll go after Ryuji… To Kansai.

[They return to the streets.]

Kaoru: So we’ve both got business in Kansai, right?

Kiryu: Yeah, I’m worried about Chairman Goda.

Kaoru: All right. Well, I need to get my stuff. Meet me back at Serena later.

Kiryu: No problem.

Kaoru: I’ll call you when I’m ready. See you then.

[Kiryu uses his free time to eat and rest. When he enters the Theater Square he is greeted by a young guy.]

Young Guy:Kiryu-san…? Wait, is that you, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Aren’t you… Takashi?

Takashi: Right. Um… Thank you so much… For everything. (bows)

[Kiryu recalls his last encounter with Takashi in the first game.]

Kiryu: (offscreen) Almost exactly a year ago… I helped the Florist’s son, Takashi, out of a bind. Takashi had gotten romantically involved with Kyoka, the daughter of the Atobe Family patriarch.

Takashi’s Girl: C’mon, Takashi! What are we standin’ around for? Didn’t you say if you won big at the tracks that tonight would be your treat?

Kiryu: And who’s this? Where’s Kyoka?

Takashi: O-Oh, th-this is…

Kiryu: So much for doing whatever it takes to make Kyoka happy, huh?

Takashi: Th-That’s…

Kiryu: In the end, you were just another punk… That’s not true, Kiryu-san! Please, just hear me out!

[They go to a bar to talk.]

Takashi: I was working my ass off! Gas stations, restaurants, construction jobs. I’ve given every job my best effort… Still… no matter where I went, I didn’t seem to fit in. I never lasted long. Then money got tight, and I…

Kiryu: (sighs) Didn’t you tell me once you’d do whatever it takes to protect Kyoka? You were ready to chop off a finger to prove it, too. Was that just a bunch of hot air?

Takashi: But… Kyoka is…

Kiryu: What about her?

Takashi: She’s… She’s meeting with another guy behind my back.

Kiryu: What? You’re sure about that?

Takashi: I asked her once, and she lied about being out with friends. But I know there’s something going on. One of my coworkers at my last job saw it firsthand. He told me he saw Kyoka go into a hotel with another guy.

Kiryu: Hm.

Takashi: Kyoka’s leaving me out to dry, and I’m the one struggling to work…

Kiryu: (sighs) You’re pathetic. You can’t even confirm it yourself. All you have to go on is what someone else told you. You’re scared of the truth.

Takashi: Scared of the truth…?

Kiryu: Exactly.

Takashi: Kiryu-san, have you ever heard the rumor about the legendary information dealer here in Kamurocho? They say he has eyes everywhere in this city. Is this true? If anyone would know, it’s you. You’ve gotta tell me, Kiryu-san.

No idea.
All right, I’ll tell you. +

Kiryu: …They call him the Florist. The Florist of Sai.

Takashi: Please… Will you take me to him? I have to know what Kyoka is really doing.

Kiryu: If I take you, it’ll be on his terms. I’ll talk to the Florist for you, but no promises.

Takashi: Thank you.

Go to the Millennium Tower
[Kiryu goes up to the 5th floor to meet with his favorite fat informator.]

Kiryu: Florist… It’s your son. Takashi wants to meet you. But the question is, are you willing to meet with him?

The Florist: Pah. You said it yourself. He’s pathetic. No backbone in this kid. Not a trait he picked up from me, that’s for sure.

Kiryu: That’s your answer, then?

The Florist: I don’t even want to look at him.

Kiryu: Hm. No backbone, huh? Maybe the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

The Florist: Hey, it’s just not my thing.

Kiryu: I guess we’re done here then.

The Florist: Wait. Takashi… The kid just wants to talk to the Florist, right?

Kiryu: Yeah, he does.

The Florist: Then that’s what I’ll meet him as. Bring him on up.

Kiryu: All right.

The Florist: Hey, was that a smirk?

Kiryu: Nah. Somewhere deep down, you want to meet this kid, I think.

The Florist: Mind your own damn business. Just bring the little shit in.

[Kiryu returns to the bar.]

Takashi: Oh hey, Kiryu-san! How’d it go?

Kiryu: He’s got a minute he can spare you. Let’s head up.

Takashi: Wow, really!?

[They return to The Florist.]

Kiryu: Takashi, this is the Florist.

Takashi: I… my name is Takashi.

The Florist: I don’t need your life story, kid. You know how busy I am?

Takashi: Then you already know why…?

The Florist: You want the dirt on the girl you eloped with, right?

Takashi: I just need to know what Kyoka is doing…

The Florist: I didn’t ask for your reasons. You’re in the market for info I happen to be selling. That’s all it is. Got it?

Takashi: Yes…

The Florist: So, one more time. You want info on this chick you ran off with?

Takashi: Yes.

The Florist: Once you know the truth, there’s no going back. Sure you won’t regret it?

Takashi: I’m sure. No matter what I find out, I’ll deal with it. I can take it.

The Florist: All right, then.

Takashi: Hm.

[The Florist pushes a few buttons.]

The Florist: This footage is about a week old.

[Kyoka is on her phone on the video.]

Kyoka: Hello? It’s me. Uh huh… Yeah… Then you’ll meet me? Okay, got it. Takashi’s out right now, so it’ll be fine. All right. The usual spot, then.

Takashi: Dammit… Kyoka!

[Kyoka walks in a hotel named “Beauty.”]

Kyoka: (waving to someone) I’m over here!

Takashi: (crying) No more, please. I don’t need to see anymore…

The Florist: You asked for this. Watch and deal with it.

[An old man walks to Kyoka.]

Takashi: Wait…

[The old man hands Kyoka an envelope with money.]

Kyoka (on video): Dad… I’m sorry about this.

Kyoka’s Father (on video):That man of yours… He quit yet another job?

Kyoka (on video): It wasn’t Takashi’s fault, though!

Kyoka’s Father (on video): It was too soon for you two. Look… Why not call things off? You know you can come home any time, don’t you?

Kyoka (on video): Thank you, Dad. But I… I believe in Takashi. He’s still finding his footing right now… But he’ll come around. So I want to support him until he does.

Kyoka’s Father (on video): Stubborn as ever… Who could you have gotten that from?

Kyoka (on video): Once Takashi settles into a new job, we’ll pay you back, no matter how long it takes!

Kyoka’s Father (on video): I expect nothing from that kid. It just kills me to see you live like this. You deserve better.

Takashi: (crying) Kyoka, I’m… I’m such a…

The Florist: The waterworks won’t solve your problems, kid.

Takashi: Both of you… Thank you. I know you guys probably think I’m full of it, but I’m gonna keep working at this. I’ll work as hard as I can. I promise… I’ll make Kyoka happy…

Kiryu: Actions speak louder than words. Go back to Kyoka, Takashi.

Takashi: Right!

The Florist: And land a stable job, huh? No more running away when it gets tough.

Takashi: Right!

The Florist: Your father would be ashamed of you right now.

Takashi: What do you know about my dad?

The Florist: I’m an information dealer. What don’t I know about your dad?

Takashi: Would you be able to find out about him, then? Where he is now? What he’s doing? If he’s even still alive?

The Florist: There’s nothing I can’t find out.

Takashi: Mr. Florist… Can you track down my father?

The Florist: You got the cash?

Takashi: What?

The Florist: My fee. Can you pay it?

Takashi: H-How much would it be?

The Florist: More than your sorry ass can afford, that’s for sure. No use quoting it. When you can actually support yourself and that girl, you come see me again. Maybe then we’ll talk like men.

Takashi: What do I owe you for this time, then?

The Florist: This one’s going on my tab with Kiryu. I still owe him a few.

Takashi: Thank you.

Kiryu: Thank him, not me.

Takashi: Thank you, Kiryu-san. Really, thank you.

[He leaves.]

Kiryu: Heh, you’re an impressive father.

The Florist: Father my ass. That was strictly professional.

Kiryu: Since when do you work pro bono?

The Florist: Shut up. Like I said, we’re square now.

[Kiryu leaves the Millennium Tower and gets a call from Kaoru.]

Kaoru: I’m ready to go. I’ll wait for you at Serena. okay?

Kiryu: All right. I’ll be right there.

[He goes to Serena.]

Kaoru: Took you long enough.

[She’s loading a small revolver.]

Kiryu: What’s wrong? Planning on using that?

Kaoru: Can’t trust anyone anymore… The chief never once told me he used to work in Kamurocho. I trusted him this whole time.

Kiryu: It’s not like Bessho betrayed you.

Kaoru: Yes he did! You’ve got no idea how hard I worked to get into Division Four. I thought he was the one guy who had my back. Turns out he was making deals with yakuza behind my back. Sorry for the detour, but we’ve gotta stop in at Osaka PD. Getting to the bottom of the Jingweon comes first.

Kiryu: Do what you want. I need to find Chairman Goda.

[Kaoru aims her revolver at Kiryu.]

Kaoru: You don’t get it. You’re still in my custody. You don’t get a choice here. We clear?

Kiryu: …Fine.

[In the next scene they fly on a plane to Osaka after which come to a place 警察本部庁告 (Osaka Police Headquarters) and walks in 取調室 (Interrogation Room).]

Bessho: Sorry, we’re full up on rooms right now. But this’ll do for a little chat, right? So, what can I do ya for?

Kaoru: Some odd 20 years back, the Dojima Family took on the Jingweon Mafia for control of Kamurocho. It was your case, wasn’t it?

Bessho: What is this, an interrogation? Yeah, I was on the case. What of it?

Kaoru: Chief, the Millennium Tower bombing, the kidnapping of Jin Goda and Daigo Dojima… It looks like the Jingweon are involved. I’ll ask you straight… There anything you wanna share?

Bessho: Nope.

Kaoru: But…

Bessho: Chill out a sec. All I know is what went down back then. No way I could know what’s happenin’ now.

Kaoru: Fine, but then why didn’t you tell me about the Jingweon!?

Bessho: I had no idea there was a connection, so I’m not gonna just spill classified intel. A bad lead’s worse than no lead.

Kaoru: That’s your only reason?

Bessho: Yup.

Kaoru: Fine. Then can you tell us what you know about the case 20 years ago?

Bessho: No prob. Where to even start? This is probably old news, but I was up in Kamurocho’s Division Four.

Kaoru: I heard. And you made the Dojima Family do your job.

Bessho: Well it ain’t that simple… But yeah, it was the only way. Cops couldn’t do a damn thing. We couldn’t find shit on ’em. Daily lootin’ and beatings had folks scared bad. When the Jingweon hit Kamurocho, the city went to hell faster than we could react.

Kaoru: But cutting deals with yakuza behind the scenes is never the right call. It only leads to corruption. Wasn’t that practically your motto!?

Bessho: There was no other way at the time.

Kaoru: I’ll change the question. The Jingweon are doing all right for an extinct mafia. Any ideas there? You know something, don’t you?

Bessho: At the time, the Jingweon Mafia was a 36-man outfit. Of that, we only found 33 bodies.

Kiryu: Meaning three survivors.

Bessho: Right. I know about one of ’em.

Kaoru: Who is it? Please, tell me, Chief!

Bessho: A place called "Keima" out in the city. You’ll find him there.

Kaoru: His name?

Bessho: These days he goes by "Murai."

Kaoru: Murai, you said?

Bessho: Sayama… I’m the one who brought Murai to Osaka. I gave ’im the name Murai.

Kaoru: What?

Bessho: It’s a miracle he survived. The Jingweon creed is "death before dishonor." Revenge comes before stayin’ alive for them. Murai broke that creed. So I helped ’im get outta Kamurocho.

Kiryu: To shield him from the retribution of the others?

Bessho: Exactly. Kawara and I brought ‘im with us when we got transferred to Kansai.

Kiryu: Kawara-san got transferred to Kansai too?

Bessho: Sayama…

Kaoru: Yeah?

Bessho: Yer protective custody job ends today.

Kaoru: What!?

Bessho: That’s an order.

Kaoru: And why’s that!?

Bessho: If the Jingweon are involved, this thing’s gotten way too dangerous.

Kaoru: Wait… Is this some chauvinist BS?

Bessho: Hell no. It ain’t like that. It’s just outside Division Four’s jurisdiction.

Kaoru: Don’t play that card now! My job is bringing criminals to justice!

Bessho: This ain’t just another yakuza hunt!

Kaoru: They’re still just people!

Bessho: (hits the table) Only reason ya can say that is ’cause you ain’t seen the Jingweon’s work. Even women and children are just more meat for the fire!

Kaoru: But… I—

Bessho: I said that’s an order, goddammit!

[Kaoru leaves the room in rage.]

Bessho: Stubborn as hell, that one. Look out for her, would ya? You’re probably the only one who can. (bes) Please…

Kiryu: I had a question for you, too.

Bessho: Oh yeah?

Kiryu: You know about Kawara-san’s shootings. Are those related to the Dojima-Jingweon incident in some way? …And to the transfer to Kansai?

Bessho: Look, I’ve already said too much. Just take good care of Sayama, would ya?

[Kiryu walks out of the police building.]

Kiryu: (I wonder where she ran off to? I should check in with her.)

[He goes to Aoi Bar.]

Tamiyo: Welcome to… Oh, it’s you, sugar. If it’s Kaoru you’re after, she ain’t here.

Kiryu: Where is she?

Tamiyo: Dunno what’s got her down, but I think she’s out drinkin’ at one of those bars again. She ducks into a bar and drowns her sorrows that way. They all know her by name, but I couldn’t tell ya which one.

Kiryu: I can think of a few bars she might be at. I’ll check around.

[He goes to Stijl.]

Kiryu: Is there a woman named Sayama here?

Staff: Oh, Kaoru-san? She left not long ago. Said she was headin’ out to the river… Maybe she’s hopin’ to relax a little?

Kiryu: Okay, thanks.

[Catching a strange feeling Kiryu runs to the river. Meanwhile some punks are harassing a girl on the riverbank. Kaoru notices it.]

Kaoru: What the hell are you punks doin’!?

Punk: Hey, baby! Somethin’ ya wanna say?

Kaoru: (flashes her badge) Whaddaya think comes next if ya try anything? (to the girl) Get outta here.

[The girl is saved and Kaoru walks away.]

Punk: Hold on!

Kaoru: What now?

Punk: Damn, girl… You’re lightin’ the fire under my heart!

Kaoru: And I’m s’posed to care?

Punk: Well… You’re one hot babe, y’know? How ’bout givin’ me n’ the boys some a’ that?

Kaoru: Ya think that gross crap’s funny!?

Punk: I’m dead serious, baby! Bangin’ a cop would be some kinky shit…

Kaoru: One more word and I’m bustin’ all of ya.

Punk: Ooh… That pouty face does it for me…

[One of the punks attacks Kaoru but she throws him in the river to cool off. Also she slaps the leader of the punks.]

Punk: I love a woman who can put up a fight…

[He slaps Kaoru and she falls on the ground. Suddenly someone touches his shoulder.]

Punk: Who the fuck are you?

[Kiryu punches the bastard.]

Kiryu: I’m her bodyguard.

Punk: (laughs) Looks like we gotta work for our fun, boys!

[Kiryu kicks their sorry asses. They run away. Kiryu helps Kaoru to stand up. Some policeman runs in.]

Policeman: Hey, what’s going on!? Stop!

[Kaoru grabs Kiryu’s hand.]

Kaoru: Come on!

[They run into some alley.]

Policeman: Where’d they go?

Kaoru: (releases Kiryu’s hand) S-Sorry.

Kiryu: It’s okay.

[Kaoru chickles.]

Kiryu: What’s so funny?

Kaoru: Nothin’, just you n’ me… It’s pretty crazy.

Kiryu: Hm?

Kaoru: Hey… You free tonight?

Kiryu: Huh? Yeah.

Kaoru: I feel like goin’ out. Care to join me?

[They walk around the city for some time and go to eat some takoyaki.]

Kaoru: C’mon, pick up the pace!

[Grabs a ball and quickly eats it. They play golf together… Kaoru broke a club.]

Staff: Hey!

[They run away like children. After that they play an UFO Catcher. Kiryu wins a bear for Kaoru and went out late into the night. In the next scene we find Kiryu standing on the roof smoking a cigarette. Kaoru enters.]

Kaoru: Sorry for the wait. Musta been a run on beer tonight.

Kiryu: No prob. It’s a great view of the city.

[They open a cold one and take a sip.]

Kaoru: Ah, that hits the spot.

Kiryu: Isn’t this your second round today?

Kaoru: Well, nothin’ beats a stiff drink after a workout!

Kiryu: Pretty great spot.

Kaoru: I know, right? It’s nice up here. My treat for comin’ out with me. I don’t usually take people to my secret spot, y’know. Consider yourself lucky!

[Kiryu and Kaoru drink a few Premium Malt’s.]

Kiryu: I’m feeling pretty good.

Kaoru: Still thirsty? I’ll buy.

Kiryu: Hm? Thanks… You’re so considerate.

Kaoru: Flattery won’t get ya nothin’ but another beer, buddy.

Kiryu: Well, it’s true.

Kaoru: Get outta here. Ya take me for the kinda girl who falls for one-liners like that?

Kiryu: I was just calling it how I see it.

Kaoru: Like I said, flattery’s not earnin’ ya any brownie points.

Kiryu: It’s kind of cute how you fight every compliment.

Kaoru: Wha— Oh pleaaase. Nobody’s ever called me crap like "kind" or "cute" before. I’m tougher than half the force… They’re terrified of me. In other words, I know flattery when I hear it. I didn’t drag ya up here so you could try n’ put on the charm…

Kiryu: Those other guys just don’t see it.

Kaoru: What, exactly?

Kiryu: That you’re a cop, but a woman too. Don’t let them tear you down. In life, I think the most important part is to just be yourself.

Kaoru: Well, I s’pose.

Kiryu: You’re pushing back so hard against everything around you right now. Maybe you’ve kinda lost yourself in the process? I guarantee, someone’s going to see the real you and cherish you for it. You okay?

Kaoru: Shall we? I’ve had one too many. Ya know… I gave up on findin’ that kinda happiness. I got nothin’ against romance, but… But thinkin’ this way got me this far. Made me who I am today. Not that anybody’d know how I feel… Nobody but me.

Kiryu: (stands up) Yeah, you’re right.

Kaoru: Huh?

Kiryu: I don’t know much about your past. But regardless of what people say, I still think you’re a kind soul. Might not be my place to say so, but it’s just one man’s opinion.

Kaoru: Y’know… You’re a funny guy. Hard to believe ya used to be yakuza.

Kiryu: Isn’t that my point? Until they get to know the real you, people’s stereotypes don’t mean much. You said you were tipsy. You good?

Kaoru: Huh? Oh… Um… Sure, let’s…

Kiryu: I just wanna watch the stars for a bit.

Kaoru: Oh? Then I join—

Kiryu: We’re meeting up with that survivor tomorrow, right? Better get some rest… Don’t worry. I won’t run off anywhere.

Kaoru: N-No, I didn’t think…

Kiryu: You said you owed me for tonight, right? Take my advice, then.

Kaoru: Right… I get it. I’ll crash at Mama’s place tonight.

Kiryu: At Aoi?

Kaoru: Yep. I’ll be waitin’ on the bridge at 10 A.M.

Kiryu: All right.

Kaoru: Hey… …Thanks.

[Kaoru leaves. Kiryu goes back to the streets.]

Kiryu: (I’ve got some time to myself. Maybe I’ll check out the city.)

[As Kiryu walks through the city, he approaches the river. He notices an old man looking at a drawing of a dragon. The old man is about to throw the drawing into the water, but Kiryu stops him.]

Old Man: Wh-Who the hell’re you? What’re ya doin’?

Kiryu: You sure you won’t regret throwing that away?

Old Man: Excuse me…?

Kiryu: It’s a tattoo design, right? And not your average design, either.

Old Man: How did you… You a family man?

Kiryu: Well… Close enough.

Old Man: C’mon, son. Join me for a cup of tea. Follow me.

[Kiryu follows the old man to his home.]

Girl: Welcome home, Master.

Old Man: I’ve got a guest.

[He gives her the drawing.]

Girl: Oh… Master, this is…

Old Man: Put it someplace he won’t find it.

Girl: Ah, of course.

Old Man: (to Kiryu) Hey, don’t just stand there. Come on in.

Girl: Please, sir, make yourself comfortable.

Kiryu: Yeah, sure.

Old Man: The name’s Kazahori IV, master tattooist. I’ve had my practice here in Osaka ’bout as long as I can remember. I owe you one, son.

Kiryu: You’re basically the top artist in Kansai, as I’ve heard it.

Kazahori IV: Oh, ya’ve heard of me?

Kiryu: Yes, from the master who did the piece on my back.

Kazahori IV: Your… back, huh? That certainly has some weight to it.

Kiryu: An artist named Utabori II inked it.

Kazahori IV: Utaboti? THE Utabori!?

Kiryu: You know him?

Kazahori IV: ‘Course I know it. Tattoos may span the globe over, but it’s a small world. Get to be a master, your name’ll get around.

Kiryu: So can I ask why you were about to throw that design away?

Kazahori IV: Oh, that… This dragon’s practically a family heirloom. Only the acting Kazahori has the right to use it.

Kiryu: The golden dragon…

Kazahori IV: So ya know it? Legendary lord of the four great gods… The golden dragon. The design’s actually a bit of a family heirloom. Passed down for generations.

Kiryu: Then why would you throw it away?

Kazahori IV: Well…

Girl: Aaah!

Kazahori IV: What was that!? What happened, Akina?

Akina: M-Master… Satoshi was just here… And he took the design!

Kazahori IV: What!?

Kiryu: It was stolen?

Akina: Yes, but we know who did it. It was the master’s first student.

Kiryu: Wait, what’s going on?

Kazahori IV: Him and this damn war of succession are the reason I was tryin’ to be rid of that accursed piece.

Kiryu: A succession war, huh?

Kazahori IV: Lemme fill ya in… I’m actually lookin’ to retire soon, and I was thinkin’ Akina here would take up the name.

Kiryu: Her?

Kazahori IV: That’s right… But the world of tattoos is a world of men. And Satoshi, my older pupil, didn’t take too kindly to the idea.

Kiryu: Satoshi is the thief?

Akina: Yes, and he’s ten years my senior.

Kazahori IV: Considerin’ the world you come from, I’m sure you understand the importance of seniority, yes? Imagine someone ten years your junior passin’ you up, and she’s a woman at that… His pride and his ego are wounded. But you’re naming Akina as your successor because she’s better, righ?

Kazahori IV: That’s right. There’s an art to tattoos that goes beyond simple skill or techniques. You’re not a master until ya can see your clients’ fates in the ink of your work. Satoshi’s just not there yet.

Akina: Master… but I don’t…

Kazahori IV: I know. Unfortunately, the other part of this little ’war’ is that Akina ain’t willing to take the name.

Kiryu: Why not?

Akina: ……

Kazahori IV: She won’t tell me, either. But even if she won’t take it, I’m not about to hand it to Satoshi like it’s some kinda consolation prize. He’s not ready to be Kazahori V.

Kiryu: Now I see what brought you down to the river.

Kazahori IV: Right. And that’s why Satoshi stole the dragon. If I won’t give him the name, it seems he’ll take it by force.

[Kiryu stands up.]

Kazahori IV: W-Wait, what are you—

Kiryu: My tattoo has a strong resemblance to that design.

Kazahori IV: What? But…

Kiryu: Yes. A dragon.

Kazahori IV: Really!? But I’d heard Utabori gave that to a man in Tojo Clan… He considered it his magnum opus, and that was almost 20 years back. I don’t believe he’s done any dragons since.

Akina: Even I’ve heard that story! So you’re really him…

Kiryu: I’m Kazuma Kiryu, and yes, I was once in the Tojo Clan.

Kazahori IV: Incredible!

Kiryu: Master Utabori taught me about both the value and the weight a tattoo carries… …Which is why I won’t stand by while Satoshi undermines all of it. I’m going to get your design back. And in return… Akina, will you tell us why you refuse to take the Kazahori name?

Akina: ……

Kazahori IV: Akina…

Akina: …I think that’s a fair bargain. Satoshi has set up shop in a building in Shofukucho.

Kiryu: Got it.

[Kiryu goes to Satoshi’s Shop though it looks more like a warehouse.]

Underling: Nice one, bro!

Satoshi: Yeah. This is all I need to really become Kazahori V. The guy with this dragon on his back is the talk of the whole town right now. And when the rest of Osaka wants in on the ink that made a legend, they’ll come knockin’!

Kiryu: You’re Satoshi?

Satoshi: Yeah. And who the hell are you?

Kiryu: I’m here to take back the design you stole from your master. I’ll be talking that dragon.

Satoshi: Oh, so Akina is sendin’ heavies after us, now?

Kiryu: No, I’m here because you don’t deserve that design.

Satoshi: Who the fuck you think you are, talkin’ to me like that? You know how many yakuza we’ve dealt with over the years? Chumps like you always think you’re tougher than ya are!

Kiryu: Then we’re done talking. But I guess you just haven’t learned to fear yet. I’ll teach you.

Satoshi: That’s our line, asshole! You’re gonna regret coming here!

[Kiryu mops the floors in the shop with Satoshi and his friends.]

Satoshi: Sh-Shit… Who are ya…?

[Kazahori IV and Akina run in.]

Kazahori IV: Kiryu-san…!

Kiryu: I got your design back.

Satoshi: Y-You… old bastard… Can’t ya see she’s got ya wrapped around her finger?

Kazahori IV: Satoshi, you’re blind. You don’t understand the true artistry of tattoos.

Satoshi: Wh-What are you babbling about?

Kazahori IV: Your fingers know their way around the ink, but your soul can’t see the colors. That’s the difference between you and Akina.

Satoshi: More of this pretentious bullshit…

Kazahori IV: Tattoos are a permanent part of a person’s life, Satoshi. It changes them. Someone like you who’s just puttin’ ink on two-bit street punks for money… Just goes to prove what little ya contribute to the art. A tattoo nurtures the man who bears it, and in turn, the design finds its home on their skin.

Satoshi: Oh yeah? Then tell me, “master”… Who’s got that golden dragon on his back now? He some great hero!? Say his name!

Kazahori IV: ……

Kiryu: Who does have that dragon?

Kazahori IV: His name is… Ryuji Goda.

Kiryu: What?

Satoshi: Hahaha! Yeah, that Ryuji Goda! Ya gave your ultimate tattoo to some crazy fuck, and now ya wanna lecture me about art!?

Akina: It’s not true! The master didn’t give him that tattoo!

Kazahori IV: Akina…!

Satoshi: Wh-What?

Akina: I was the one who inked the golden dragon.

Kazahori IV: Ten years ago, when I first laid eyes on Ryuji Goda, I was dumbstruck. I knew then that man would be my finest canvas. I decided to inscribe the family dragon. But after I’d started the outlines… My hands froze up. Couldn’t move a muscle.

Akina: It’s true. So I took over. I finished the Master’s tattoo.

Satoshi: Th-That tattoo was… yours?

Akina: That’s how I learned the true weight of being a tattoo artist… And I’ve never been more scared. Ryuji Goda climbed the ranks of the Omi Alliance… And now he’s clawing his way toward the throne itself. I never dreamed a man bearing my ink could become what he has…

Kazahori IV: Akina. That’s why you deserve the name. A master tattooist’s calling is to make bigger men of their clients. So that’s why you rejected the Kazahori name?

Akina: …Yes. I’m afraid of giving men like him more power…

Kazahori IV: Akina…

[They go back to Kazahori’s Shop. Kiryu takes off his jacket revealing his dragon.]

Satoshi: Th-That’s..

Kazahori IV: It’s… Utabori-san’s… dragon.

Kiryu: Ever since I took this dragon, I’ve gained a lot and lost as much. But this dragon and the way my life has turned out are connected… I believe it’s all fate. You weren’t wrong to have given Ryuji Goda that dragon.

Kazahori IV: Kiryu-san…

Kiryu: It’s easy for men with power to stray. They’re only human. But… setting them straight isn’t your job. The artist can lay the paths, but the man chooses which one to walk. Akina-san… If the art weighs that heavily on you… How can you turn away from the Kazahori name that stands on Ryuji’s path?

Akina: Kiryu-san…

Kiryu: Best of luck to you. (walks away)

Akina: Kiryu-san! I won’t run anymore! I’ll become Kazahori V. Thank you for showing me that!

[Akina and Kazahori IV bow to Kiryu. He leaves the building.]

Chapter 11: THE IRON CREED
Kiryu: (It’s almost 10:00. Sayama’s waiting for me at Iwao Bridge.)

Kiryu: So? You ready? What’s up?

Kaoru: I was thinking about everything last night, and I got this bad feeling.

Kiryu: A bad feeling?

Kaoru: Yeah… What if I’m one of the Jingweon survivors?

Kiryu: How do you figure?

Kaoru: If what Mama said is true… And my parents were killed 20-some years ago by the Tojo Clan… Wouldn’t it make sense if the Tojo Clan killed them in the Jingweon raid? It would line up, wouldn’t it?

Kiryu: You? Another Jingweon survivor?

Kaoru: You can’t deny it’s possible.

Kiryu: Want to call off the meeting with Murai?

Kaoru: I won’t run away from my past.

[Kiryu lights a cigarette but Kaoru quickly takes it away.]

Kaoru: Let’s get moving.

[They walk a bit.]

Kaoru: The chief said we’ll find Murai somewhere called “Keima.” I need to hear what he has to say.

Kiryu: You’re sure about this, though?

Kaoru: Don’t worry about me. Whatever he can say, I can handle it. But first we’ll need to hit the streets to see if we can even find the place.

Find Keima
[Kiryu approaches some guys sitting in an aopen cafe.]

Kiryu: Excuse me, do you know of a place called “Keima”?

Shogi Lover: Keima…? I’ve heard the rumors, but I couldn’t give ya any facts. Oh, so you’ve got some confidence in your shogi skills?

Kiryu: Not really.

Shogi Lover: That so? Maybe ya oughta take a glance at the rulebook. The world of shogi’s like the universe, an infinite expanse of possibility. May your moves bring ya closer to victory than ruin.

[Kiryu and Kaoru approach some old man.]

Kaoru: Hey, excuse me. Ever heard of a place called "Keima"?

Old Shogi Player: …”Keima”? I’ve heard the name, but I couldn’t tell ya where it is.

Kaoru: I see…

Old Shogi Player: Reason I know it though is ’cause I knew a guy who was in and outta there back in the day.

Kiryu: Then you do know it?

Old Shogi Player: How about… three big bills for the tip?

Kiryu: I don’t have enough on me for that. I’ll be back, though.

Old Shogi Player: If ya say so…

Kaoru: “Keima” is what the knights are called in shogi, so it’s probably a shogi parlor. I can’t play shogi to save my life, though, so I leave that part to you.

[Kiryu finds the money to pay for the information.]

Old Shogi Player: What’s up, buddy? Feel like coughin’ up the dough?

Kiryu: Fine…

[Kiryu pays 30,000 yen.]

Old Shogi Player: Oho! I do enjoy a smooth negotiation! Well, a deal’s a deal. The guy who can get ya in is a gamblin’ man who goes by Ginkaku. There’s a rundown bar west of Shofukucho called ”Mino.” He used to hang out there. And that’s all I know. Pleasure doin’ business with ya.

[Kiryu runs to Mino.]

Kiryu: No good. It’s locked…

[He notices a poster near the door.]

Kiryu: This poster looks pretty old…

Kaoru: But look. There’s a phone number on it. I’lI just jot this down. It’s probably a cellphone. Give it a call, maybe?

[Kiryu calls the number.]

Kiryu: (…They actually picked up.) Hello? I have reason to believe you can tell me about a place called "Keima."

Unknown Voice: There’s this popular hostess down at the Red Sirloin. Goes by Yukina-chan, and she’s known for bein’ pleasantly plump. Her sizes, please?

Kiryu: What the hell? What’s that have to do with anything?

Unknown Voice: There’s this popular hostess down at the Red Sirloin. Goes by Yukina-chan, and she’s known for bein’ pleasantly plump. Her sizes, please?

[Kiryu trying to guess but fails.]

Kiryu: What the… He hung up.

[He runs in an adult movies shop.]

Cabaret Fiend: I’m already missin’ Yukina-chan! Once you lay eyes on that buxom body, all other hostess cease to exist! I got her sizes, y’know. She’s 110, 100, 109, top to bottom! Heh heh heh… Why don’t ya head down there and request her yourself, bud? You’ll never see women the same way!

[Kiryu calls the number again.]

Unknown voice: There’s this popular hostess down at the Red Sirloin, Goes by Yukina-chan, and she’s known for bein’ pleasantly plump. Her sizes, please?

[Kiryu tells Yukina-chan’s sizes.]

Unknown voice: That’s right. Make yourselves comfortable down at Mino for a spell.

Kiryu: Wait, what? Damn… He hung up.

[Kiryu returns to Mino to find some more clues.]

Kiryu: (The door’s unlocked…)

Kaoru: How strange… Ugh, what smells so damn foul?

Kiryu: Doesn’t seem like the place has gotten much use lately.

[He examines the room.]

Kiryu: (This shogi board has some pieces on it. From left to right, its the gold general, rook, king, pawn, bishop, and silver general.)

Kiryu: (This note refers to shogi pieces. From left to right, it says "king," "gold general," “silver general,” and “pawn.” What’s the significance, though?)

Kiryu: (That safe looks pretty suspect…)

[He tries to open it.]

Kiryu: (No luck. Must be the wrong combination.)

[He solves the puzzle and opens the safe.]

Kiryu: I was right.

Kaoru: What?

[Kiryu’s phone is ringing.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Unknown Voice: Well done. Wasn’t that simple? Now. Go order a Christmas present at Komian.

Kiryu: What the… He hung up.

[Kiryu walks into a nearby Komian store.]

Komian Employee: Hi there.

Kiryu: I was told to order a Christmas present…

Komian Employee: …Ah, that. Just take a seat, sir.

[The employee brings the present.]

Kiryu: (There’s something hard in this! W-What the hell…?)

Komian Employee: Come see us again!

Kaoru: Well?

Kiryu: I found this in the food…

Kaoru: A shogi piece? What do you think it means, though?

Old Shogi Player: Ooh! Hey buddy, what a coincidence. Did you get to meet Ginkaku?

Kiryu: No, but the latest hoop I jumped through ended up giving me this shogi piece.

Old Shogi Player: That so? Oh, hey… That piece… That’s not a ryuma piece, is it?

Kiryu: Excuse me?

Old Shogi Player: Look, why don’t ya just give me that piece, bud. Not like it means anything to you, am I right?

Kiryu: I’m still not sure what all this is supposed to mean, quite frankly.

Old Shogi Player: Then c’mon, hand over that piece!

Kaoru: We’re not going to just hand it over while we’re in the middle of this wild goose chase. Wanna explain why it’s so important?

Old Shogi Player: What a yappy bitch… If ya won’t hand it over… it’s only gonna bring ya pain.

[Kiryu and Kaoru kicks his ass.]

Old Shogi Player: Huff… Huff… Damn you!

Kaoru: So, care to tell us what’s so important about this piece? It’s your turn to be the yappy bitch.

Old Shogi Player: That piece… It was crafted by a master, considered a treasure among us shogi players… It’s basically a golden ticket into even the most underground shogi parlors… Any shogi player worth his salt would kill to have one. So I guess I’m lettin’ ya off the hook today… I won’t show no mercy next time…

[He runs away. Kiryu phone’s ringing.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Unknown Voice: Impressive work. That piece is quite coveted, so I’d be careful if I were you.

Kiryu: Come on… How long do we have to play this stupid game?

Unknown Voice: Oh, don’t be that way. This is fun. For me, anyway. No hard feelings, I hope.

Kiryu: I just want to know where Keima is.

Unknown Voice: Show that piece to Santa Claus, and his red-nosed reindeer will guide the way.

Kiryu: What? Santa Claus? This is getting even more ridiculous.

Unknown Voice: That’s all the help I’ll give ya. May your moves bring ya closer to victory than ruin.

[Kiryu approaches some yakuza guarding Sun shine Club.]

Kiryu: Excuse me… Are you Santa Claus by any chance?

Yakuza: Huh? You think it’s wise to spout that kinda nonsense at strangers?

Kiryu: I take it you’re not. Sorry to bother you.

Yakuza: You fuckin’ with me!? If you want Santa so bad, here’s a goddamn present!

[Kiryu pounds his ugly mug.]

Kiryu: Not him… No choice but to keep trying.

[He finds a guy in a red suit.]

Man in Red Suit: …Somethin’ ya need?

Kiryu: (I should show him that piece…)

Man in Red Suit: That piece… Who referred ya?

Kiryu: Ginkaku…

Man in Red Suit: Don’t know how ya got it, but… Ain’t my circus, ain’t my monkey. Follow me.

[They walk to some abandoned building.]

Man in Red Suit: We’re runnin things from here today.

[Kiryu and Kaoru enter the parlor. Some man tending a bonfire with kettle on it greets them.]

Man: This ain’t a date spot, kids.

[Kiryu shows him the piece.]

Man: This is Heinosuke Sugiura’s work. Surprised ya got yer hands on one. So? Who ya playin’?

Kiryu: Murai.

Man: Murai…?

Kaoru: Yeah, Murai’s our man.

[The old man in the corner with the round glasses gets all excited when he hears the name. Kaoru walks to him.]

Kaoru: Are you Murai-san?

Old Man: This is what the board looked like after the 142nd move of the 1984 Meijin Match. Yabuta, the challenger, promoted his bishop to 5-8. That’s what sealed his defeat. Any pro would know the right move would be silver general to 4-3 to defend the king. For some reason Yabuta went on the offensive… People called it a rookie mistake, but I don’t buy it.

Kaoru: I’ve got a question for you.

Old Man: Nothin’ I know would be of interest to a young lady like you.

Kaoru: We got your name from Bessho from Osaka PD. Don’t worry, I work under Chief Bessho. I need to know about the Jingweon Mafia. You remember that night in Kamurocho… Don’t you?

[The Old Man wants to leave but Kaoru stops him.]

Kaoru: I think I may be one of the survivors. Were there any children there too young to remember it?

Old Man: …There was one.

Kaoru: Please, I need details!

Old Man: If you can live without knowing, you’ll be a lot better off.

Kaoru: Please, tell me!

Old Man: After losing the Meijin Match, Yabuta quit shogi, fell to booze and eventually died. He was bent on reaching the top, but my guess is he realized he couldn’t cut it. He saw his fate in the tiles. He chose a move that defied fate, chose to die on his own terms. Life can be cruel. You’ve made it this far without knowing, miss. No reason to take on that burden now.

Kaoru: There’s nothing you can say that I can’t handle. That’s why I came here today. Please. Tell me what you know! I’m not moving until you do. I’m begging you!

Old Man: It was Christmas night.

Kiryu: On Christmas?

Old Man: We were all busy celebrating when the Dojima Family burst in. They killed with precision, one man after another…

Kaoru: But you three managed to survive…

Old Man: Right…

Kaoru: You managed to flee to Kansai with help from Kawara-san and Bessho-san, right?

Old Man: Yeah, but men sent in from the mainland found me down here. And yet, here I am today.

Kaoru: How?

Old Man: I sold out my own.

Kaoru: The other two survivors?

Old Man: No, not Daejin Kim and Yeongmin Ji.

Kaoru: Daejin Kim and Yeongmin Ji…?

Old Man: They were only 16 at the time, but somehow they made it out alive. Who knows where they are now.

Kaoru: In that case, who’d you sell out?

Old Man: Truth is… There were two more. Two other survivors… They were… The boss’s wife… And her child.

Kaoru: Her child?

[We’re going back to the 80’s, in the same building from the beginning of the game. Kazama aims at wounded Korean guy. Kawara hides behind the corner. Kazama shot the Korean guy.]

Korean Guy: [… You lying dog! Though I die, we’ll live on… See you in hell!]

[The guy falls on the floor. Kazama aims at young Murai, but he changes his mind and walks away. Kawara runs out to the killed guy.]

Kawara: Hey, stay with me…

Korean Guy: My child… I… beg…

[Kawara hears baby cries and runs towards it.]

Murai: [Boss!]

[Suddenly Shimano comes out and shoots Murai. We’re back to the present.]

Murai: He missed my heart, and I survived… After that night, I was given the name Murai, and here I am today.

Kiryu: So Sayama’s father… was the Jingweon boss?

Kaoru: Where did his wife and her child go then?

Murai: They both escaped with Kawara-san..

Kaoru: So you sold a woman and her infant to the syndicate to save your own skin!?

Murai: I’m not sure what happened to them after that.

Kaoru: The mother died. Only the child survived!

Murai: Are you… You’re really that poor kid?

Kaoru: (hits the shogi table) Who killed the father?

Murai: I don’t remember his name, just his face. I remember his moustache…

Kiryu: That’d be… It has to be Kazama-san.

Kaoru: Hm?

Kiryu: The man who raised me. Shintaro Kazama.

Kaoru: You’re sure?

Kiryu: Yeah. I was there too.

[Kaoru’s eyes widen with shock. At that moment, several men with knifes burst into the room.]

Man: Who the hell are—

[One of the attackers kills him sticking his knife in the man’s stomach.]

Kiryu: Jingweon Mafia, I presume?

Leader: That’s right.

Kiryu: The bombing and the kidnappings… You’re the ones?

Leader: Absolutely. And we owe you our thanks. You tracked down the deserter for us.

Kiryu: Before you get to him… You’re going to tell me where Chairman Goda is being held.

Murai: It’s no use. They’re elites, straight from the mainland. No way in hell they’ll talk.

Kiryu: Well… You gonna tell me where Chairman Goda is or not?

Leader: Hardly matters. You’ll be in hell soon!

[Kiryu and Kaoru are forced to fight the Jingweon thugs.]

Kiryu: Now tell me where Chairman Goda is!

[One of the thugs throws his knife into Murai… and hits his stomach.]

Kaoru: Stay with me…!

[Leader takes advantage of the moment and pours poison down his throat from the ring. The other thugs do the same.]

Murai: That’s the Jingweon creed… I… should’ve followed it, too. Thinking a man like me… Who ruined so many lives… …Had any right to lead a happy, normal life… I was a fool… You can’t beat fate… I should’ve died that night. I’ll be sure to… tell your mother… Her little girl’s grown up right. Live to your fullest…

[He puts the piece on the shogi board, creating perhaps some combination. Then he takes the handle of the knife and sticks it deep into his belly and dies. Shocked Kaoru runs out of the parlor.]

Majima Saga - Chapter 3: MAD DOG OF SHIMANO
[We return to Majima, who was massaged by an unsuspecting Makoto, the blind girl he saved years ago.]

Makoto: Is this pressure okay, sir? I’ll move on to your feet next, okay? There may be some discomfort, but just shout if it gets to be too much.

[Majima wants to scream in pain, but restrains herself so Makoto won’t recognize his voice.]

Makoto: Hm? Is there any pain, sir? No, then? If you say so, sir.

[Majima endures some more pain.]

Makoto: I’ll do your arms next, okay?

[Majima notices the watch on Makoto’s hand and gasps in shock. She still wears them. So it’s definitely her.]

Makoto: Oh, sorry! Is my watch bothering you? It’s… a treasure of mine. I’ve had it almost 20 years… I take good care of it. When the strap wore out, I even got a new one for it. It’s an old piece though, so new colors don’t really match it… I really liked the original design, it felt more sophisticated… To tell you the truth I got it from someone who saved my life. I… Actually, there was a time when I was blind due to psychological reasons… That was when I met him. I was just a stranger caught in a big mess… But he protected me with his life, never even telling me his name. At the lowest point in my life… He pulled me back from the darkness. Thanks to him, I even regained my vision. I got married, had a child… I’m always swamped, but life is great. Back then, I never would’ve imagined a future like this was possible for me… I’m… really happy now. I’m just so glad I didn’t lose hope, that I found the will to keep going… But when we parted ways, I never even got a chance to thank him for that. I’ve regretted it ever since… In fact, that’s what led me back to working at this massage parlor. This is actually where I first met him. And Sotenbori is a special town to me, full of memories of what time we had… So I thought if I stuck around and just led my life in these old haunts… Maybe I’d meet him again one more time. Meet him, and finally get a chance to say "thank you." Oh dear, I’m so sorry I put you through such a depressing story! Sorry, I’m extra chatty today for some reason. Y’know… Not even my husband knows that story, so it’s our little secret, okay?

Majima: (quietly) Heh.

[After the massage Makoto walks to leaving Majima.]

Makoto: Oh, sir! Have one of our membership cards… Please.

[Majima silently takes the card.]

Makoto: Um… We haven’t met before, have we?

[Majima is shocked but shakes his head.]

Makoto: U-Um! Are you feeling better at least, sir?

Majima: Ya worked out some knots I’ve had for 18 years.

Makoto: (clueless) Thank you so much!

[Majima walks out of the Relaxation Center and sees the receptionist.]

Receptionist: You got lucky, you know. This is actually Tateyama-san is really good, isn’t she?

Majima: Yeah… I’m glad I came.

Receptionist: You got lucky, you know. This is actually Tateyama-san’s last week.

Majima: Wait, she’s quitting?

Receptionist: Yes, apparently her husband’s job is taking them overseas. Losing our number one masseuse is really going to hit our shop hard.

Majima: How many more days does she have in the country?

Receptionist: Huh? Uh, I think she said something about getting on a plane early next week.

Majima: …Hm.

Receptionist: (bows) Well, thanks for coming in, sir!

[Majima phone’s ringing.]

Ayumi: Um, sir? This is Ayumi, over at the Grand!

Majima: Ya sound kinda worked up. What’s goin’ on?

Ayumi: It’s Kawamura! He’s here!

Majima: Say what?

Ayumi: I was at a VIP table with an exec from… Well, he was from the Omi Alliance… But then Kawamura charged in and shot the guy! We’re in a lockdown situation right now, so get here quick!

Majima: Yeah, I’m headin’ there now. Just hang tight! (Kawamura just shot an Omi exec? What’s that damn kid thinkin’!? I better haul it to the Grand!)

=Go to the Cabaret Grand=
Majima: (This is the end of the road, I’d say. Should I handle business, or am I bein’ hasty? Alright, it’s on!)

[Majima enters his old cabaret, which he created with his own hands.]

Majima: Kawamura!

Kawamura: Boss…?

Majima: The hell are ya doin!?

Kawamura: I’m sorry… But I didn’t have a choice… If I didn’t kill him, it woulda been me…

Majima: What do ya mean!? You the one who shot Uematsu!?

Kawamura: …Yes. But there’s only one left… Just one more. And when it’s done… I’ll be free.

[He points his gun at Majima.]

Majima: Kawamura… Son of a…

Kawamura: If I kill you, boss… I get out alive. I’m really sorry, boss… But die, please!

[Majima pulls out his tanto and shreds this sorry shit in seconds.]

Kawamura: You’re really something… Boss. If only I’d met you earlier… My life might’ve been different.

Majima: Kawamura… Why’d ya pull a stunt like this?

Kawamura: Boss… I’m so sorr—

[Someone shot him in the head. It’s Ibuchi!]

Ibuchi: You did well, Kawamura. We’ll consider your debt… paid in full.

Majima: Ibuchi…!

Ibuchi: Wield both scissors and fools with caution… An old one, but still true. Shoulder their debts, and they’re clay in your hands. A little money, a little violence… Yakuza are truly silly and oh so simple.

Majima: So you’re the guy pullin’ all the strings, Ibuchi?

Ibuchi: (points his gun at Majima) Heh… Yes. Exactly.

Majima: So… What’s your motive?

Ibuchi: You know what’s one of the most illogical and old-fashioned industries in the world? It’s the yakuza. A bunch of brainless cretins professing duty and ideals as they rule in whatever haphazard way they see fit… Really, their methods render the industry all-too inefficient… Coming from a consulting background myself, I decided to do some proper management.

Majima: What the hell?

Ibuchi: I’ll plan to consolidate the yakuza clans scattered across the country and provide some semblance of logic to our underground world… In other words, I’m going to update the yakuza. I’Il take this musty relic and completely redraw it.

Majima: And you killed Uematsu as part of this dream of yours?

Ibuchi: Yes, the consolidation of the yakuza.

Ibuchi: As my foothold, I decided the Tojo Clan would be simple enough to overthrow. I tricked Terada into pushing me through the ranks and got rid of those in my way… Including Uematsu… and you. Naturally, I’ll have to take care of Terada when the time comes. That’s how I’ll seize the Tojo Clan… And then hand it to the Omi Alliance.

Majima: The Omi!?

Ibuchi: Yes, if the Omi acquires the Tojo Clan, it would be the largest yakuza organization in Japan. From there, national consolidation is elementary…. And I would take on the esteemed post of reorganizing the underworld into its ideal structure, I will create a logical, more modern yakuza world. One that isn’t swayed by duty or ideals.

Majima: Heh… What a crock.

Ibuchi: I don’t expect a man like you to understand the true value. But I’m already in talks with an executive at the Omi Alliance. All that’s left is to execute it. However, to ensure a smooth merger of the Omi and Tojo… I need an explosive catalyst… And by that… I mean war. There’s no firmer trigger than the death of an Omi executive at Tojo Clan hands… Kawamura had very nearly seen that through… But it’s a shame that a punk like Kawamura would kill you… When I can do it myself. Sorry, but your death is my kindling for the coming blaze. You’ll be the foundation that rights this rotting underworld. That’s not so bad, is it? You’d probably end up dead in some ditch anyway. At least dying here… …Gives it meaning.

Majima: Mine ain’t the kinda life that guys like you attach prices to. I don’t give a shit about your little vision. I’m only here… to knock that smug-ass grin off your smug-ass face!

Ibuchi: (laughs) Typical, that you would try to change fate by force alone… An idiotic dinosaur of a yakuza like you… Needs to be extinct, Majima!

[Majima quietly pulls out his tanto and, dodging a shot, wants to stab Ibuchi in the stomach. Ibuchi evades and tries to shoot Majima in the face. Majima steps aside and attacks, but Ibuchi manages to dodge out of the way. After a brief exchange of strikes, Majima knocks the gun out of Ibuchi’s hands and attacks, but Ibuchi grabs the pistol in mid-air and shoots straight into Majima’s tanto. An epic battle between the two patriarchs ensues! Majima wins of course. Ibuchi lies on the floor, panting.]

Majima: (grabs Ibuchi by the face) If ya thought I’d let ya get away with takin’ out one of mine… (puts his tanto to Ibuchi’s neck) Who’s the real idiot here? Go eat your slop in the can. And learn to see things my way. (throws Ibuchi on the floor)

Ibuchi: (grabs his gun) It’s too late, Majima…! The wheels are already spinning. War will consume the east and the west. And the Tojo Clan will fade. (laughs) Things are just about to get interesting! It’ll be prime entertainment! So I’ll go on ahead… And get the best seat in the house.

[And he shot himself. Majima walks away and returns to the Tojo Clan building.]

Terada: Majina-san… I’m truly sorry about how things unfolded. It falls on me for failing to see Ibuchi’s true intentions. I’d always known he had something of a devious side, but… I focused so intently on the numbers, I lost sight of what cannot be quantified… Perhaps I’ve been going about it the wrong way…

Majima: The chairman shouldn’t admit he’s wrong, even if it’s true.

Terada: Hm?

Majima: You’re the fifth chairman of the Tojo Clan. If you say it’s white, it’s white. If you say it’s black, it’s black. That’s the yakuza world we live in. No matter your methods, if you think you’re right, you are. But, right or wrong… I think your methods suck

Terada: Heh.

Majima: Enough on that, though. It’s the Omi we gotta worry about.

Terada: The Omi?

Majima: I was throwin’ down right in the Omi’s backyard on this little escapade. Even if it was Ibuchi’s plot, it don’t change the fact that one of my boys killed an Omi exec. They gonna take that sittin’ down?

Terada: Right… I admit, the Omi is already demanding an explanation.

Majima: If we get into a war with the Omi now… We’re cooked. So I’ve got an idea I wanna propose.

Terada: An idea?

[Majima pulls out his tanto in its shielth.]

Terada: Majima-san…

[They go to sit down with the Omi Alliance.]

Terada: Regarding the incident… We apologize profusely for the disruptions to the Omi Alliance.

Ryuji: "Profuse" apologies? More like spit in the wind. You’re as lenient as ya’ve always been… Terada-han.

Toranosuke: He may have been third rung, but one of our officers is dead thanks to your clan’s little tiff. How ya gonna make this right? Answer wise now… Or Kansai and Kanto may be goin’ to war on the grand scale.

Jin Goda: Let’s relax… We didn’t set up this meeting to start a fight. I apologize for my officers’ lack of grace.

Terada: Not at all.

Jin Goda: However, Sengoku and the others have a point. If we let this slide without reparation… It’ll set a bad precedent down through the ranks. War is the last thing I want. But how do you plan to take responsibility?

Majima: Yeah, about that. Ibuchi may have set the whole thing up, but in the end, it was one of my crew who did the deed. So the fault lies with me, his patriarch.

Takashima: Oh? And how do you plan to take responsibility?

Majima: The Majima Family… I’ll disband it.

Toranosuke: ’Scuse me!? The Majima Family is practically the reignin’ authority in the Tojo Clan these days. Ya think you can disband a family like that just ’cause ya feel like it!?

Majima: (angerly) If lsay we’re done, then we’re fuckin’ done! (calmly) The Majima Family is gone of us are leavin’ the Tojo Clan includin’ me. We apologize profusely for what happened. With that… Are ya willing to settle accounts? (bows)

[Jin Goda stay silent. Everyone leaves the room except Toranosuke, Takashima and Ryuji.]

Toranosuke: Just when the sparks of war were ’bout to ignite… That Majima guy goes n’ pulls the rug out.

Takashima: If you want a war so badly, why didn’t you pick a fight then and there?

Ryuji: Pickin’ a fight with a no-bullshit guy like that? Outta the question.

Toranosuke: ‘Sides… I’m sure we’ll get our chance to take on the Tojo Clan sooner or later, eh? I’ll save the fun and games for when that day comes.

Takashima: War, huh? Would it be fair to ask if one of you was behind Ibuchi in the first place?

Ryuji: Those’re fightin’ words… So right back at ya. Goro Majima… Hell of a guy.

[Meanwhile Majima opens a construction business.]

Majima: Gentlemen! Mornin’!

Workers: Good morning…

Majima: That was weak shit! People who can’t give a proper greetin’ can’t build a proper building! Now! Once more! Ready… All together now…

Workers: Good morning!

Majima: See. I knew ya had it in ya! So why didn’t ya do it right the first time!?

Worker: U-Um, Boss?

Majima: Eh? What? Are we really going to be running a business called Majima Construction? Building a huge complex like Kamurocho Hills… That’s impossible for amateurs like us!

Majima: Ya jackass! (slaps the worker)

Majima: Amateurs, huh? Stop cryin’ like a buncha babies! Are we gonna get any hills built with an attitude like that!?

Worker: No, that’s exactly what I’m trying to say, actually…

Majima: For a job like this… Ya look it up on the internet and start buildin’!

Worker: S-Seriously!?

Majima: Ready boys? Today is the first day of our new lives! Not as a yakuza, but as a blue-collar civilians! …Who work day in and day out! Any complainers… get no paycheck! Actually… I’ll kill ya first!

Worker: We’re… a sweatshop, aren’t we.

[Meanwhile Makoto already board her plane with her husband and son.]

Makoto: Right, passport, passport… Ah…

[She finds a giftbox in her purse. She recalls that this giftbox was handed to her by the receptionist in the Relaxation Center.]

Receptionist: This came addressed to you, Makoto-san. There’s no sender though… Think it’s one of your regulars?

Makoto: Hm!?

[Inside the giftbox there’s a pair of watch straps.]

Makoto: This… I used to wear this… How, though?

[She recalls her talk with one of the clients that was Majima.]

Makoto: (offscreen) It’s an old piece though, so new colors don’t really match it… I really liked the original design, it felt more sophisticated… When the strap wore out, I even got a new one for it. I’ve had it almost 20 years… I take good care of it.

[After a while, the plane lands.]

Makoto’s Husband: What’s wrong, Makoto? Couldn’t sleep?

Makoto: No, no, I’m fine. This’ll be a fresh start for us.

Makoto’s Husband: Do you have any regrets?

Makoto: Nope. Not anymore.

THE END

Chapter 12: OSAKA CASTLE
[Kiryu and Kaoru take some fresh air after that happened in the shogi parlor.]

Kiryu: Will you hear me out? That Christmas, I headed to the Dojima Family office… Every Christmas, Kazama-san used to come to Sunflower, the orphanage I grew up in. But we hadn’t seen him at all that day. I was getting worried about him, so I snuck out to Kamurocho on my own.

[Shimano and Kazama get in the car. At that time, a young Kiryu, who looks about 12-15 years old, runs up to them.]

Young Kiryu: (bows) It’s been a while, sir.

Kazama: Why are you here?

Young Kiryu: I wanted to talk to you.

Kazama: Not today, kid. Go home.

Kiryu: (offscreen) I knew him to be a kind man… But that night was different. I was worried, so I followed him. He was going to defy his boss and let the Jingweon live… Of course, I didn’t know that…

[He follows Kazama and overhears him talking to a Korean Mafia boss, who points his gun at Kazama.]

Mafia Boss: You’d just… let us walk away?

Kazama: On one condition. That you leave this town for good.

Mafia Boss: Sounds like a trap to me.

Kiryu: (offscreen) I couldn’t hear what they were saying. I thought… the old man was in danger. I just wanted to protect him.

Kazama: Call your men and head out the back.

[The sound of a gunshot comes from somewhere. Apparently Shimano has already started to kill.]

Kazama: It’s only a matter of time before they’re all dead. You have to trust me!

[At that moment, young Kiryu bursts into the room with a piece of pipe in his hands.]

Kazama: Kazuma!?

Mafia Boss: I knew this was a trap!

Kazama: Wait! The boy’s not Tojo Clan!

[Young Kiryu Attacks Mafia Boss…. A shot is fired… Kazama shot Mafia Boss to protect Kiryu…]

Young Kiryu: I… …Thought you were… …In danger…

[The Mafia boss crawls out of the room. Kazama, stone-faced, slowly follows him. The scene from the beginning of the game repeats, only now we see events from the young Kiryu’s perspective.]

Mafia Boss: […You lying dog! Though I die, we’ll live on… See you in hell!]

Kiryu: (offscreen) Kazama-san was protecting me.

[We return to the present.]

Kiryu: That’s why he shot him… I didn’t pull the trigger… But it may as well have been me who killed your father.

[Kaoru stands up and walks away.]

Kiryu: Weren’t you going to shoot me? I told you I’d make this right.

Kaoru: Oh, drop the tough guy act! You think what you did will just go away if I take my revenge? To make things fair, I should kill you? You should know, nothing about life’s so black and white!

[She walks away. Kiryu stands and ponders until darkness falls. It is raining outside. Kiryu tries to light a soggy cigarette and flicks his lighter, remembering Kaoru’s words.]

Kaoru: (offscreen) To make things fair, I should kill you? You oughta know, nothing about life’s so black and white!

[An old man walks by with a bag of groceries. A jar falls out of the bag and Kiryu bends down to pick it up.]

Old Man: …Sorry.

[When Kiryu gets up, the old man stabs him in the stomach and quietly walks away. The girl standing next to him starts screaming. The jar falls out of Kiryu’s hands. He falls to the planked platform, but finds the strength to get up and remove the knife from his stomach. He slowly walks away.]

Kiryu: (The blood’s not stopping! Was there poison on the knife? I’ve gotta get to Aoi before I black out…)

[Kiryu slowly walks to Aoi and opens its door in the last of his strength. There’s Tamiyo and Kawara talking.]

Tamiyo: Hey! What happened!?

[Kiryu collapses. The scene changes and we get to Sengoku’s office.]

Toranosuke: I hear the Go-Ryu Clan put on a little show in Sotenbori?

Ryuji: The Koreans pulled that stunt on their own…

Toranosuke: No shit? They’re doin’ so much of yer work, it’s hard to tell. Not that it got ya anywhere…

Ryuji: (puts his hand on the katana) You pickin’ a fight?

Takashima: Don’t let him get to you.

[Ryuji takes his hand off his katana.]

Toranosuke: Look who’s all grown up now! Still, I’ve got the Omi chairmanship in the bag.

[Some thug brings ties up Haruka to the room!!]

Toranosuke: Kiryu takes my bait, I take his head, bam!

Takashima: A plan that suits you, Sengoku.

Toranosuke: Hey, word on the street is Kiryu’s a tough nut to crack. (nasty laugh)

Ryuji: Suit your damn self. I’m takin’ down Kiryu and the Tojo Clan my own way.

Toranosuke: Fuck yeah! Let the great race for the Omi throne begin!

[He laughs so hard it echoes in the night skies. Meanwhile Kiryu wakes up.]

Tamiyo: Hey, take it easy there, tough guy.

Kiryu: That man you were sitting with… That was Kawara-san, wasn’t it?

Tamiyo: Oh, yeah. He was checkin’ in on Kaoru.

Kiryu: What about her?

Tamiyo: Weeell… Anyway, this is yours.

[She gives him a note.]

Kiryu: What is it?

Tamiyo: Don’t ask me. It was in your jacket.

Kiryu: When did this…

[He recalls his killer…]

Kiryu: That guy… (reads the note) No…!

We have your precious child.
-Sengoku

Tamiyo: I know I can’t stop ya, but with that wound… You’re pushin’ your luck…

[Kiryu approaches the door, but stops.]

Kiryu: Has she been back here at all?

Tamiyo: You just leave worryin’ after Kaoru to Kawara-san. Ya hear me? Be careful out there, sugar.

[But Kiryu leaves the bar. Someone calls him.]

Blocked Number: You Kiryu?

Kiryu: Who are you? And how’d you get this number?

Blocked Number: Those ain’t the questions that matter, fool. Ya want Haruka back? Then listen up.

Kiryu: Where is she!? If you’ve hurt her…!

Blocked Number: No more questions. If ya want her back, get down to the Yokobori Golf Center. And come alone.

Kiryu: Hey! Who the hell is this?

[The caller hangs up.]

Kiryu: (The Yokobori Golf Center… Fine. I could swear I’d heard that voice before, though.)

[Kiryu rushes to the Golf Center and meets some guy near the elevators.]

Unknown Man: ‘Bout time you showed up. I thought y’actually cared about the little brat.

Kiryu: Where’s Haruka!? Did you leave Sengoku’s note!?

Unknown Man: Heh. You’re spewin’ nonsense. Ain’t no matter anyway. Y’won’t be leavin’ this place alive!

[Enraged, Kiryu knocks the jerk to the floor.]

Kiryu: Where’s Haruka!? Where is Sengoku!?

Unknown Man: Ugh… All I was told… was t’kill you… I don’t know nothin’ past that…

Kiryu: Then who hired you!?

Unknown Man: Heh, well…

Kiryu: Say it, before I make sure you can’t!

Unknown Man: Gurgh! I get all my contracts online! Safer that way, man! I got no names!

Kiryu: Damn…

[Someone calls him.]

Kurokawa: Kiryu-han! Got some news for ya! Just wish it was good news… Ya gotta get down to the river path, lickety-split! Meet me there, would ya?

Kiryu: Got it, Thanks, Kurokawa.

[He meets the flashy informator near the river.]

Kurokawa: Ahh, Kiryu-han. Glad you’re here, bud.

Kiryu: Yeah. What’s this about bad news? If this is about Haruka…

Kurokawa: Yeaaaah, that. ’Fraid I can’t tell ya.

Kiryu: What?

Kurokawa: See, I already got word that ya took out the heavy at the golf center. I called him out all the way from Hiroshima on this job. You’re a tough nut to crack, pal. Didn’t figure on you bein’ that tough, though.

Kiryu: Wait, don’t tell me…

Kurokawa: I got the distinct feelin’ I shouldn’t let ya outta my sight… You got the look of a man worth a whole mountain of cash, Kiryu-han. Figured it was only a matter of time ‘till I could find a way to collect on it. Well, today’s the day, boss. No hard feelings, I hope.

Kiryu: That was your doing!? How much have you known this whole time!?

Kurokawa: Feh… Me n’ my big mouth. Let’s cut the chitchat, shall we? Sorry, Kiryu-han… Ya been good to me, bud. But I got money on the mind, y’know? Well, let’s get ya strung up and put on the spit. My boys here won’t go down as easy as that clown from Hiroshima!

[Enraged by Haruka kidnapping and this betrayal, Kiryu beats Kurokawa and his girl scouts to a pulp.]

Kiryu: Where is Haruka!? And keep it short! And if I don’t like your answer, the river’s right here.

Kurokawa: I-It was Esaki… He hired me… Said if I sunk your ass, he’d give me 10 mil…I-I’ve always been a sucker for cash. And ’sides, to do business in this town, ya gotta stay on Sengoku’s good side…

Kiryu: Where is he!?

Kurokawa: He’s hidin’ out in the acupuncture clinic…

[Kiryu runs there.]

Acupuncturist: Hey, never seen your face in here before. What can I do ya for?

Kiryu: I found out there’s an acupuncture clinic here, so I figured I should get myself checked up.

Acupuncturist: Hahaha, we most certainly will. Lemme explain how it works. Acupunctures a special kinda treatment where we poke ya with little needles to stimulate pressure points on your body.

Kiryu: Sounds complicated.

Acupuncturist: Hahaha, not clickin for ya? Most patients don’t figure it out ‘til they actually have a session. Here, first session’s on me.

Kiryu: Are you sure?

Acupuncturist: ‘Course I’m sure! Plus if ya end up bein’ a regular, I more than recoup the cost.

Kiryu: Heh, not a bad deal for you. All right, I’m ready.

Acupuncturist: Okay. Just come on into the back room. Here we go. Ya just gotta take your shirt off ’ lie facedown on the bed.

Kiryu: Okay.

[The screen goes black.]

Acupuncturist: ……All done!

Kiryu: What the…?

[Kiryu gets back to the reception.]

Acupuncturist: So? What’d ya think?

Kiryu: That was amazing. I feel light as a feather. Your needles definitely had an effect. I’m getting images of battle from within me. I like this. I’ll back this place from now on.

Acupuncturist: Hmm… I’m happy ya say that, but it won’t have much effect if ya come too often, ya know?

Kiryu: Hm? What do you mean?

Acupuncturist: As I said in the beginnin’, my needles activate yer muscle memory and sublimate the experience into yer body. So in other words, if ya got no experience to sublimate then it’s no good, Even if ya get treatment, it ain’t gonna have an effect.

Kiryu: I see…

Acupuncturist: That’s why ya gotta come back when va stack up a buncha experiences. When that time comes, I’ll treat ya right.

Kiryu: All right, I understand. Then I’m counting on you when that time comes.

[He notices Esaki in the clinic.]

Kiryu: Esaki!

Esaki: Rgh! How did…!?

[He runs away but Kiryu easily catches him.]

Kiryu: Hold it!

Esaki: …Aw shit!

[Kiryu fights Esaki and crushes him like any other ordinary punk.]

Esaki: Nngh!

Kiryu: You’re out of places to run, so talk! Where is Sengoku? Where’s Haruka!?

Esaki: If I tell you, I may as well be signin’ my own death warrant…

Kiryu: Then would you prefer to get a running start or lrt me sign it for you right now?

Esaki: Y-You wouldn’t! (his phone’s ringing) H-Hold on!! Hold on a sec… Yes, hello? …Huh? What!? Then what was I even… B-But isn’t that..? Y-Yes, sir. I get it. (to Kiryu) Sengoku-han says I should bring ya to him. If I go, I’m dead for sure. Go by your damn self.

Kiryu: Where?

Esaki: Osaka Castle. You’ll see when ya get there.

Kiryu: Osaka Castle…?

Esaki: Uh, hey, I know it’s a little late to ask, but… I’m on borrowed time here… Ya wouldn’t wanna protect me, would ya?

Kiryu: Yeah right. Try praying to Billiken over there.

Esaki: …It’s over, I’m finished…

[Kiryu takes a cab to Osaka Castle. It SPLITS IN HALF REVEALING ANOTHER BUILDING. Kiryu enters it. There’s a bunch of armored soldiers and a Sengoku thug controlling them.]

Kiryu: Where is Haruka!?

Sengoku Thug: Up in the central tower. But, it’s not like you’ll be reachin’ the top regardless. (to the soldiers) Put an end to this fucker… Now!

[Kiryu makes his way through the classic Japanese castle, fighting soldiers, ninjas, dodging traps and much more. On the top of the castle the general awaits him.]

Toranosuke: Real damn impressive! Didn’t think ya’d make it this far.

Kiryu: Sengoku!

Toranosuke: Not so fast there…

Kiryu: Haruka! Let her go!

Toranosuke: Keep shoutin’ like that, and yer gonna wake up my little pets.

[A couple of tigers walks in.]

Toranosuke: They tend to wake up kinda hungry… Think ya might have a snack for ’em? How ’bout every bone in yer goddamn body!?

[Kiryu punches the tigers.]

Toranosuke: What are ya, some kinda monster!?

Kiryu: Give… Haruka… back!

[Sengoku runs away with Haruka. Kiryu easily catches him. Time to punch the pig I guess.]

Toranosuke: R-Ryuji!? What the fuck ya doing here!?

Ryuji: I gotta sympathize with ya… Puttin’ up with this chump’s games.

Toranosuke: H-Hey, what’d ya call me!?

[Ryuji slashes him with his katana.]

Toranosuke: Y-You crazy fuck!

Ryuji: Naw, just a man willin’ to do what it takes, same as you. But takin’ a kid hostage? That’s pretty low.

Toranosuke: A man my ass! You’d be nothing if not for yer daddy!

Ryuji: Shut the fuck up!

[He pierces the fat Toranosuke’s body with his katana and throws him off the castle.]

Ryuji: Finally, some peace n’ quiet.

[He releases Haruka.]

Ryuji: Day after tomorrow… We’re comin’ at Kamurocho with all we’ve got. You ready?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Ryuji: Later, then.

[He leaves. Kiryu unties Haruka.]

Kiryu: You must have been scared. I’m sorry. Sorry I let this happen to you again…

[He bends down in pain.]

Haruka: What’s wrong!?

Kiryu: I’ll be fine.

Haruka: Stay strong, Uncle Kaz!

[Kaoru suddenly runs in!]

Kaoru: Looks like that wound must’ve reopened.

Haruka: What? He’s hurt?

Kaoru: He’ll be good as new soon. I promise.

Haruka: Thank goodness.

Kiryu: Why did… you follow me?

Kaoru: Mama told me about the note you got.

Kiryu: I see…

Kaoru: I’m glad you’re all right. Always gotta act so tough… This guy!

[But… someone watches them from the shadow… it’s Kawara!]

Chapter 13: SETTLING ACCOUNTS
[The gang are back to Aoi. Kiryu’s stomach is mended.]

Haruka: There, all better.

Kiryu: Thank you.

[Kaoru reads a note lying on the counter.]

Kaoru: What? What’s this?

Kiryu: What’s wrong?

Kaoru: This note Mama left me…

Kiryu: What does it say?

Kaoru: “Your dad is still alive, honey. Don’t blame Kiryu-san.”

Kiryu: He’s alive?

Kaoru: If he’s still alive, then who and where is he!? And why is Mama writing me notes and running off?

Kiryu: You haven’t seen Tamiyo-san lately?

Kaoru: I’ll search the neighborhood.

[She leaves.]

Haruka: Who is she looking for?

Kiryu: The lady who raised her.

[Kiryu dresses up.]

Kiryu: Is this your first time in Kansai, Haruka?

Haruka: Yeah, I didn’t get to go on too many trips or anything.

Kiryu: Right… Well, what do you say we go exploring for a bit?

Haruka: Can we? Yaaay! Let’s go, Uncle Kaz!

[They walk through the night straits of Sotenbori.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz, Uncle Kaz! Look, that’s Sakura!

Kiryu: Hm? She a friend of yours?

Haruka: Noooo, it’s Sakura Fukunaga… She’s a super-famous actress.

Sakura: See ya, hun. Looking forward to this drama deal.

Producer: Ehhh, you know it, babe! It’s in the bag! Talk soon!

[Sakura leaves in her car.]

Haruka: She was really pretty, huh?

Kiryu: Hmm…?

[The producer notices Haruka.]

Producer: Hey, miss! You there, little angel! You’re the goose’s golden egg! A diamond in the rough! I can tell! A girl like you comes around maybe once a decade… No way… More like… Once a century! You’re a star in the making!

Haruka: Mister, who are you and what are you trying to get from me?

Producer: Haven’t ya ever dreamed of bein’ a star, angel? Becomin’ a real celeb? Of course ya have! Everybody does.

Kiryu: Haruka, what’s going on?

Producer: You this angel’s daddy? I ain’t nobody suspicious, so allow me to introduce myself here. I’m the president of Sotenbori Productions, friend.

Kiryu: And that is?

Producer: We’re a talent agency! And sir, I say your girl here’s got the wings of an angel, and with our help, she could learn to soar. Whaddaya think? I can practically guarantee she’d be one of the hottest acts in Japan.

Kiryu: A little girl like Haruka?

Producer: Yeah! Say, our office is just over yonder., Whaddaya say we have a quick chat?

Haruka: (sighs) Let’s just keep walking, Uncle Kaz.

Producer: Ahh, hey! A quick chat won’t hurt, pal! If you’re in a rush, I’d be happy to reschedule! Here, here, let’s do this. Ya got a cell on ya, pops?

Kiryu: Sure.

Producer: Thanks! Let’s see here…

[He turns away and takes some coke I guess?]

Kiryu: H-Hey!

Producer: Alrighty, that’ll do it! I just gave ya my direct number. When you want to see your girl shine, you just give me a call! I’ll wait!

[He walks away.]

Kiryu: You sure, Haruka?

Haruka: Yeah, I don’t know about that.

[They continue to walk around the city. When Kiryu and Haruka enter a bridge, Kiryu’s phone starts ringing.]

Producer: Hello? This is Sotenbori Productions. The president, to be specific.

Kiryu: That talent agency?

Producer: Yeah, I’m callin ‘bout your little girl.

Kiryu: How’d you get my number?

Producer: I memorized it when I put my number in your phone, pal. I’ve got this game doan, sir, and I couldn’t let that little girl slip through the cracks.

Kiryu: ……

Producer: I can’t get the little angel outta my head! I’ve gotta say, this is the first time I’ve felt such a gravitational pull. She’s gonna be big. Huge, even! I’ve got the instinct for this. I can personally assure ya that she’ll live out her dreams. Can I convince ya to at least hear me out? Whenever you’re free, would ya swing by the office with her? I’ll wait. However long it takes, I wait.

Kiryu: I’ll think about it…

[Kiryu goes to the office of the producer. He sees some thug talking to a girl.]

Thug: C’mon, babe. Give it a damn rest!

Young Woman: I said it before n’ I’ll say it again. You agents are all crooks! I did everythin’ y’all said, and I still got no debut?

Thug: Oh, don’t give me that! Only reason ya didn’t get a debut is ‘cause ya didn’t put in the effort! Ya know what they say, babe. The product ain’t gonna sell itself. Takes hard work and perseverance. Can’t expect everythin’ handed to ya, right?

Young Woman: I don’t need to take this! Give it back! Give me back my money! It’s like a sick joke. Registration fees, lesson fees, head shot costs… It all adds up. They think I’m just gonna roll over and let them take everything from me? I’m gettin’ it back, I swear.

[Kiryu walks to the entrance of the office.]

Kiryu: Wait here a sec, Haruka.

Haruka: Okay.

Producer: Ahh, I been waitin’! Please, please, have a seat.

Kiryu: I’m only here to let you say what you wanted to say. Don’t make any assumptions.

Producer: Yes yes yes. And thank ya for doin’ so! See, how it works is, we’ll take the young lady into our care, and put her into trainin’. Acting lessons, voice training, dance lessons… She’d learn all the tools to make her idol debut. We’d also negotiate a killer contract on her behalf. And of course, we wouldn’t neglect her studies. Our girls go to only the top notch schools in the area.

Kiryu: Sounds awfully generous.

Producer: Of course it is! We invest in her future for our modest cut down the road. And that li’l lady’s gonna be a star. I can feel it in my bones. If I’m bein’ honest, we’ll make back what we put in to her ten fold. I’d have no regrets about spoilin’ her rotten now. My instincts haven’t steered me wrong yet!

Kiryu: I still can’t imagine Haruka in show business. I want her to live a good, honest life.

Producer: I understand that, pal. Any father would worry for his little girl. Ya toss her into show biz, full of those big headed yakuza types… I really do understand…

Kiryu: Yakuza types, huh? (Haruka has been kidnapped four times now… Even with me around to protect her. No… I’m not protecting her. I’m the very reason she’s in danger. It’s my fault she gets wrapped up in these things.)

Producer: So whaddaya say? Can ya trust me to care for your little girl?

Give me some time to think.
This could be in Haruka’s best interest… +

Kiryu: You might be right… This could be in Haruka’s best interest…

Producer: Eh, ya know it is! Now, lemme just draft up some paperwork!

Kiryu: This is going to be tough…

Haruka: Aaaah!

Kiryu: Haruka!?

[Kiryu goes outside. The same bald thug who was talking to the girl outside the office is now squatting and talking to Haruka. A few of his buddies are standing next to him.]

Kiryu: Who are those guys?

Producer: Fools from a rival agency. Real pieces of work, these guys. They got Omi backing, so they think they run the biz here…

Thug: (to Haruka) C’mon, guys. Don’t let this chump sucker ya into a bum deal. Our agency’ll take way better care of ya!

Kiryu: Haruka!

Haruka: Uncle Kaz, help!

Kiryu: Hang on, Haruka. These punks need some lessons in how to do business.

Thug: The fuck!? You talk pretty tough, gramps!

[Kiryu teaches them how to behave.]

Producer: (clapping) Wow, incredible! Now, we were about to move to contract signing, as I recall. Let’s go back inside. You too, angel.

Kiryu: Yeah…

Haruka: What contract, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: ……

Producer: We just took the next step toward your future, angel! You’re gonna be an idol! You’re gonna shine so bright, your daddy here’s gonna need shades! You’ll be at a top-ranked school, livin’ like a princess!

Haruka: (to Kiryu) How could you just decide that? This isn’t funny!

Producer: Naw, you’re daddy’s only doin’ it for your sake, angel!

Haruka: I’m happy just the way things are!

Kiryu: Haruka, listen.

Haruka: No! Uncle Kaz… You’re abandoning me? I don’t want to be alone any more…

Kiryu: That’s not it. I’m the one giving you reasons to be scared…

Haruka: But I’m not scared. You’ve been there to keep me safe. If you leave me here, I’ll find you on my own. I’ll go all the way to Kamurocho if I have to.

Kiryu: Haruka…

Haruka: So let’s go home!

Producer: Ah! H-Hey, hold up, now! All that talkin’, and I get zilch!? You’re killin’ me, big guy! My golden egg…! My diamond in the rough…!

Haruka: Sorry, Mr. President!

Producer: That’s the smile! That right there! That would get ya off a murder charge! You’re carryin’ a secret weapon!

Haruka: Bye bye!

Producer: Goodbye, little one! Oh my god! Did I really just fall for that!? Ya ain’t seen the last of me! Mark my words!

[Kiryu and Haruka continue to stroll around Sotenbori.]

Girlfriend: Hey, remember that girl with the amazin’ voice?

Boyfriend: The one who always practiced down by the river?

Girlfriend: Yeah, did ya know she works at that bar? I think it’s called Stijl.

Boyfriend: Does she sing for folks who go drinkin’ in there? We should drop in sometime!

[Kiryu and Haruka go to Stijl. The waiter appears to be the same girl the thug was talking near the agency.]

Male Customer: What, ya don’t do requests, girly!? That how this goes!?

Female Staff: Sir, I… It’s just so sudden. I-I—

Male Customer: Shut up n’ sing already!

Female Staff: No, I’m not a good singer, I…

Male Customer: Don’t care if you’re tone-deaf! How hard is it to get some damn singin’ here!?

Female Staff: I don’t want to disturb anyone else here… I’m sorry… (bows)

Kiryu: Hey, quit pestering her. You expect her to sing when she’s this uncomfortable?

Male Customer: Feh! Talk about yer buzz kills. I’m done here, and I ain’t never comin’ back!

Female Staff: I’m sorry… That was so embarrassing.

Kiryu: It wasn’t your fault. Don’t worry about it.

[Haruka and Kiryu leave the bar and walk some more. They find the girl from Stijl looking at the river.]

Kiryu: You enjoy singing, I take it?

Female Staff: Oh, you’re the man from the bar.

Kiryu: You’ve got a great voice. Why don’t you have more confidence?

Female Staff: I… I just don’t.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Female Staff: I… I do love to sing. I wanted to do it professionally for a while. I even took a bunch of voice lessons. I was almost sure I was on the cusp of my big debut… But I should have known better. My agency was conning me…

Kiryu: ……

Female Staff: All of a sudden, I was knee-deep in debt, and it took a toll on my family… I was out on the streets when the owner of that bar took me in.

Kiryu: That’s really terrible, and I’m sorry. But you still want to sing, don’t you? All the bad luck in the world shouldn’t make your dream less worth pursuing.

Female Staff: That’s beautiful, but idealistic, too. How could I tell that to this barkeeper? He’s the only reason I’m even alive. I’m sorry. I ought to be going.

[Kiryu and Haruka continue walking around Sotenbori and encounter the producer again.]

Producer: Ahh, I been lookin’ everywhere for ya!

Haruka: You still don’t get it, mister!?

Producer: Ahaha! If persistence is what it takes to change your mind, then I ain’t afraid to pull out all the stops!

Kiryu: ……

Producer: Ah, then allow me to sweeten the pot a bit. I’ll pay your signin’ bonus up front! 10 million yen!

Kiryu: This isn’t about money. You’re going to have to forget about her.

Producer: Mmmmrghh… I’ll double it! 20 million! That’s a sum that’d make anyone think twice!

Kiryu: You know what… There’s someone I’d like you to meet, now that I think about it.

Producer: Eh? What’s all this about, pal?

Kiryu: Be quiet and follow me, would you?

[He leads the producer to the riverbank.]

Female Staff: ♪ Lord, prayers I will raise, I am generous with praise Heaven knows what’s going on ♪

Producer: Holy smoke! What a voice! The angels are cryin’ and the tears are piercin’ my heart! My spine’s shiverin! She’s exactly what I been searchin’ for! A million-seller! I can feel it!

Kiryu: Your agency’ll give her the same life you promised for Haruka?

Producer: Gahaha! My man, I have heard the siren’s song and I am entranced! She ain’t slippin’ away! I need paperwork, right now! Gonna just call up my boys real quick! This is happenin’!

Haruka: Good for you, mister!

Kiryu: Haruka… Let’s head back to Aoi.

Haruka: Good idea, Uncle Kaz.

[Hey grab a bite and return to Aoi.]

Haruka: We’re going back to Kamurocho soon, right, Uncle Kaz? Are you sure you don’t wanna do anything else here first? It would be a shame to leave with loose ends… Sooo… You’re ready to go, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: I’m all set, Haruka.

Haruka: Okay, great!

[Kiryu phone’s ringing.]

Kiryu: This is Kiryu. You’ve taken Date-san hostage?

Kurahashi: Now, now. Calm down and listen.

Kiryu: Who is this?

Kurahashi: Tokyo PD Division Two’s Wataru Kurahashi.

Kiryu: Kurahashi from Foreign Affairs?

Kurahashi: Well, 20 years ago, it wasn’t Kurahashi. I was "Yeongmin Ji" then.

Kiryu: So you’re another Jingweon survivor.

Kurahashi: Exactly.

Kiryu: Did you take Date-san on Go-Ryu orders?

Kurahashi: No, they’ve got nothing to do with this. The time is finally ripe for the Jingweon Mafia to strike. We will have vengeance for the cruel deaths of our brothers 26 years ago.

[Kaoru enters.]

Kiryu: Date-san had nothing to do with it!

Kurahashi: He’s unfortunately just the bait we need to gather all the players.

Kiryu: Gather them? Who are you after?

Kurahashi: The people who ruined our lives 26 years ago. You’ll be joining us too, won’t you?

Kiryu: Where?

Kurahashi: The heart of Kamurocho.

Kiryu: The Millennium Tower…

Kurahashi: Please arrive by dawn. Otherwise, I’m afraid the entire building will go up in smoke this time,

Kiryu: Fine. I’ll be there.

Kurahashi: Ah, one more thing. Please make sure Kaoru Sayama comes along.

Kiryu: Why?

Kurahashi: (laughs) You’ll know soon enough… (hungs up)

Kaoru: I just got a call from the chief. He said they’ve taken Date-san.

Kiryu: That was the guy who took him just now. How could a man in his position be a Jingweon survivor…

Kaoru: Kurahashi from Foreign Affairs, right? So? What’d he want from you?

Kiryu: Us. At the Millennium Tower, by dawn.

Kaoru: The Shinkansen doesn’t run this late. We’ll have to drive!

[Meanwhile, Kawara is driving somewhere in the car and talking to Bessho on the phone. Tamiyo is holding the phone for him.]

Kawara: I’m heading to Kamurocho now. Looks like we were right…

Bessho: Yeah… Shit hit the fan. We’ll keep the Omi Alliance in check, long as we can.

Kawara: Good, thanks. Leave Kurahashi to me.

Bessho: They got nothin’ left to lose this time… Watch yer back up there.

Kawara: Will do. (hungs up)

Tamiyo: If she finds out she’s got that accursed blood in her, Kaoru might—

Kawara: I’m not letting that happen. That’s why I’ve been hunting them down for the last 26 years.

[Haruka, Kiryu and Kaoru, meanwhile, drive the van to Kamurocho. Kiryu falls asleep in the back seat.]

Haruka: He’s pretty tired, huh?

Kaoru: You like your Uncle Kiryu a lot, huh, Haruka-chan?

Haruka: Yup. He’s always there to protect me. Do you, Kaoru-san?

Kaoru: I’m just with "Uncle Kiryu" for work. I’m here, like him or not.

Haruka: But he sure seems to like you, Kaoru-san.

Kaoru: What…?

Haruka: He acts different around you than he does around other people.

Kaoru: Different how?

Haruka: He acts… like he does around me, I guess.

Kaoru: And how does he act around you?

Haruka: He’s usually quiet, but he’s really nice. People are always asking for his help, and he pushes himself really hard for them. I guess he doesn’t have to worry when he’s with you, so he can just be himself.

Kaoru: …I see. You’re pretty mature, Haruka-chan.

Haruka: I don’t think so. Last year we went through a lot of sad stuff, that’s all. Nowadays I can sorta understand how he feels.

[Someone shoots off the van’s rear-view mirror. Kiryu wakes up.]

Kiryu: What happened!?

Kaoru: They tailed us!

Kiryu: Floor it and keep driving!

[Kiryu opens the van door and jumps onto the platform of the truck chasing them. There are a bunch of Jingweon mafioso standing on the platform. Kiryu crushes them.]

Haruka: Hey, we’re…

Kiryu: Yeah… Serena.

Kaoru: We’ve gotta move. Time’s almost up. Let’s hurry!

Kiryu: Can you wait here, Haruka?

Haruka: Okay. Be careful, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: I will.

[He and Kaoru walks out of Serena.]

Kaoru: Kurahashi wants me to come to the Millennium Tower too, right?

Kiryu: Yeah, he said we’d find out once we got there…

Kaoru: Why would he want me there, though? ‘Cause of the Jingweon blood I have? I guess there’s no point taking stabs in the dark.

Kiryu: There’s not much time. Let’s head to the Millennium Tower.

Go to the Millennium Tower
[Kiryu and Kaoru run to rescue Date. They go up to the 50th floor and find that all the Florist’s equipment is ruined.]

Kurahashi: Welcome, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: You’re Kurahashi?

[Kaoru aims at Kurahashi. In the corner of the room we see the tied Date, the Florist and his staff.]

Date: Don’t shoot! He’s got the place wired to blow!

Kurahashi: Precisely.

[One of Florist’s employees, a traitor who arranged a power outage, removes a rag from a huge bomb.]

Kaoru: So why’d you call me here?

Kurahashi: You’re one of the stars in this little tale of revenge.

Kaoru: Because I have Jingweon blood in me?

Kurahashi: You already know? Then join us in avenging the massacre of our brothers 26 years ago.

[Kawara and Tamiyo appear. Kawara points his gun at Kurahashi.]

Kawara: Don’t listen to him! Don’t assume she’s anything like you!

Kaoru: What’s going on here!?

Kawara: Kurahashi… I’ve had you marked since the day you took Japanese citizenship and joined the force. That’s why I ditched Division One to follow you to Foreign Affairs. I figured I’d let you go if you could abandon the creed, but you couldn’t, huh? I never should have let a bastard like you out of my sights.

Kurahashi: I have no interest in your little speech! Take a step closer, and I’ll blow this entire building to dust.

Kawara: Go ahead and push the button. You scraped by for 20 years, living a lie just to stay alive. You don’t have the balls.

Kurahashi: Are you so sure!? I would gladly die for revenge! That’s the Jingweon creed!

[He tries to press the button, but Kawara knocks the remote control out of his hands with a shot.]

Kawara: Don’t give me that creed bullshit. You remember Murai? Korean named Hoejong Park. He lived under the weight of what he’d done. Robbery, arson, murder… Looking back on what you all did, it only proves he actually had a soul. But you’d say he deserved to die for breaking the creed? This madness needs to stop. Murai is dead. Once I take care of you and Daejin, it’ll all be over. (prepares to kill Kurahashi)

Date: Don’t!

Kawara: You stay out of this! If I don’t finish this here, more innocent blood will spill later!

Kurahashi: (laugh) You could kill a man with your daughter watching?

Kaoru: Wait. What does he mean, your daughter? Don’t tell me…

Kurahashi: Yes, I’m talking about you. Kaoru Sayama-san.

Kaoru: What? You? … You’re my father?

Kawara: He’s lying! Just stay back!

[Kurahashi uses the moment and shoots Kawara in the shoulder.]

Kurahashi: He and the boss’s wife, Suyeon Jung, got together and had a kid. You. Your father is this man… Jiro Kawara!

Kawara: Shut your damn mouth!

[Kurahashi shots him multiple times. Tamiyo rushes to Kawara.]

Tamiyo: Kawara-san!

Kurahashi: Kawara!

Kawara: Only one thing has kept me going through the hell of these last 26 years… The revenge I take today! I know you slaughtered my brethren who came over from Korea, too! I’ll put a bullet in you for every one of them you murdered!

[Kaoru stands in his way.]

Kurahashi: You would violate the Jingweon creed?

Kaoru: Your creed’s got nothing to do with me!

Kurahashi: Fine… I’ll send you to hell alongside your father!

[Kiryu rushes to Kurahashi to punch him. The traitor pulls out his gun, but Kaoru shoots him first in the arm. The traitor runs away. Kurahashi is disarmed and grappled.]

Kiryu: This town has had enough of the Jingweon Mafia!

Kurahashi: Ah, the bastard son of the Dojima Family.

Kiryu: Since Kazama-san can’t do it himself… You get to deal with me.

Kurahashi: Interesting…

[A couple of mafioso enters. Kurahashi breaks free.]

Kurahashi: We will have our vengeance! This ends here and now!

Kiryu: You’ll have to go through me!

Kurahashi: Kill him!

[Kiryu punches Kurahashi and his boys to a bloody mess after which he unties Date. Kurahashi stretches to the detonator.]

Kaoru: Move and I’ll shoot!

[Kurahashi stealthily pulls out a gun.]

Kurahashi: Die!

[Kawara covers her with her body. Kurahashi only had one bullet. Kaoru helps Kawara’s weakening hand to aim at Kurohashi and kill him.]

Date: Kawara-san!

Kaoru: You saved me… Thank you.

Kawara: I got to act like a father.

Kaoru: Why didn’t you ever tell me?

Kawara: I wanted to… respect your mother’s wishes.

Kaoru: Her wishes?

Kawara: I first met her that night… The night of the raid…

[He recalls that fateful night of mass murder in which he helped a mother with her child.]

Kaoru’s Mother: [Stay back! I won’t let you take my baby!]

[She carries little Kaoru to the window to drop her off.]

Kawara: Don’t!

Suyeon: [Let me go! Just let us die!]

Kawara: (slaps her) That kid’s innocent. Don’t just throw his life away.

[He helps them leave the burning building.]

Kawara: (offscreen) I knew Suyeon would be in danger in Kamurocho. Bessho and I snuck her down to Kansai… I checked in on her about six months later. It was like that horrible night had cut a hole right through her heart. She was falling apart at the seams…

Kaoru: What happened to her child?

Kawara: She gave him up through her tears.

Date: Gave him up?

Kawara: In the shape she was in, Suyeon wouldn’t have lasted. I found work for her. Tried to help her build a new life…

Kawara: (offscreen) Before we knew it, we were living together. Then, Kaoru… You were born.

Young Kawara: I think I’ll turn down the Hong Kong post.

Suyeon: Why?

Young Kawara: I can’t just leave you two here.

Suyeon: It’s only a year, silly! It’s for your career, so we’ll make do. Just go, and don’t fret about us. Grow up strong while Daddy’s gone, and well all have fun when he comes back!

Kawara: (offscreen) But, while I was gone… Suyeon was murdered.

Kaoru: By who?

Kawara: Jingweon men, sent in from the mainland… That’s when I set out to kill off every Jingweon man still in Japan…

Date: So that’s why… All those illegal aliens you shot were…

Kawara: All Jingweon men.

Date: Revenge for Suyeon’s death?

Kawara: Not just that. I needed to erase Kaoru’s past.

Kaoru: My past?

Tamiyo: Before she died, your real ma came to me. She wanted ya set free from the curse of your past…

Kaoru: That was her dying wish?

Tamiyo: Afraid so… Then she gave ya to me, someone with no connections to the Jingweon at all. And poor Kawara-san had to keep his distance from ya too.

Kaoru: But you called Mama sometimes, right?

Kawara: Yeah… And you picked up on the Tojo Clan from one of those blasted calls. Dragged you right back in…

Tamiyo: That was all my fault. I didn’t know Kaoru was there.

[We plunge into memories. Little Kaoru overhears Tamiyo talking over the phone.]

Tamiyo: I don’t know what happened, but I know this! The Tojo Clan made Kaoru’s life a livin’ hell!

[Back to the present.]

Kaoru: No, I’m happier knowing. Not knowing who you are… There’s nothin’ scarier.

Kawara: Sorry…

Kaoru: After the raid… What happened to my mom’s other child?

Kawara: I’m afraid… It’s not my place to say… Just… remember this, Kaoru. The blood running through your veins isn’t Jingweon blood. It’s kind, hard-working, and strong… Like Suyeon.

Kaoru: Like you, Kawara-san. It’s your blood too, Dad.

Kawara: (smirks) This takes me back… Holding your hand… You used to grab my fingers and laugh… Your hands were so tiny… For me, for your mother… Find your happiness.

Kaoru: Dad…

Kawara: Thanks… kiddo.

[He dies. Everyone puts their heads down and keeps quiet. Kaoru bursts into tears.]

Chapter 14: THE GO-RYU MARCH
[Kiryu and The Florist walking around a port. There’s a sign over their heads 安全第一 (Safety First).]

The Florist: Guess I’m back where I’m meant to be.

Kiryu: Yeah, so it seems.

The Florist: Me and my boys are better at lurking below the surface than lording from above anyway.

[Date hands Kawara’s packed ashes to Kaoru.]

Date: Kawara-san was a good cop to the last.

Kaoru: I’m glad I knew my dad… Even if it wasn’t for very long.

Tamiyo: We’ll put him to rest next to Suyeon.

Kaoru: Good idea… I think he’d want it that way.

Tamiyo: Leave it to me, honey.

Kaoru: I put ya through a lot… I’m sorry.

Tamito: (almost crying) Hush now, child. It’s all part of bein’ yer mama.

Kaoru: Mhm.

Date: (to Kiryu)  I’m still wondering about the kid Sayama’s mother gave up 26 years ago.

Kiryu: Same. If the Jingweon got to him, he could be involved in all this somehow.

The Florist: That, and the rat in my office got away.

Kiryu: We’re not finished with the Jingweon just yet.

Date: (pulls out a CD) If we can analyze this, maybe we’ll find a lead. Kurahashi had it on him.

The Florist:Nicked it before the cops searched the body?

Date: Yeah. Maybe she can crack it open.

[Kaoru and Tamiyo mourn for Kawara. The scene changes to Ryuji’s limousine.]

Go-Ryu Thug: (on a phone) Got it. We just left Osaka too. We should be there by tonight. Later. (to Ryuji) Five heaping truckloads of weapons just pulled into Kamurocho, boss.

Ryuji: Good. Not long then?

Go-Ryu Thug: Right.

Ryuji: Bustin’ in to Kamurocho’s been on the Omi’s to-do list for ages. Not even the old man could check it off.

Go-Ryu Thug: And now the Go-Ryu Clan will finally drive the wedge into Kamurocho.

Ryuji: Yeah. This’ll be my stagin’ ground to take down every yakuza clan ’cross the nation. Then, I’ll become the one true dragon. (to himself) Watch close, pops. I’m ’bout to do what you couldn’t.

[The camera zooms out and we see a good 20 limousines driving down a six-lane road! It’s gonna be a fierce battle! The scene changes to Takashima;s office. He talks on the phone with someone.]

Takashima: Everything’s going according to plan.

Man: Don’t celebrate just yet.

Takashima: You have no business patronizing me. I’ll head up when the time is right. Bye. (hungs up) Enter.

Takashima Thug: Excuse me, boss. The Go-Ryu Clan has finally mobilized against Kamurocho, sir.

Takashima: I see.

Takashima Thug: They’ll beat us to the punch, sir.

Takashima: Don’t get too excited.

Takashima Thug: But, boss…

Takashima: We’ll make our move eventually. There’s plenty of time. And don’t forget… We’ve got an ace in the hole.

[Meanwhile in Purgatory… Kaoru using a notebook to read the CD.]

Kaoru: No dice.

Date: No dice?

Kaoru: Yeah. I can’t seem to brute force this password. I’ll need a special application that’s not on this PC.

Date: I see…

Date: It is what it is.

Date: Wait… Isn’t there still…

The Florist: What?

Date: Couldn’t you read it using the system downtown?

Kaoru: At police HQ?

Date: Yeah. We’ve got a high-tech crime unit up here, too. Maybe their system could decrypt it.

The Florist: But Tokyo PD’s not exactly on our side on this one.

Date: That’s the tricky part. I’m in no position to be calling in favors myself…

Kaoru: Guess that’s out, then.

The Florist: Wait a sec… Why not use Osaka’s system?

Kaoru: What?

Date: Yeah, that could work! Sayama, where are you off to next?

Kaoru: Um… I was gonna head back home with Mama.

Date: That’s perfect. Take this down to the office and have a crack at it. You’d have the tools there, right?

Kaoru: Uh… Yeah, probably.

Date: Good, then it’s all you.

[Kaoru takes the CD, looks sadly at Kiyu and leaves.]

Kiryu: (Something was off about Sayama… She’s not okay with all this…)

Find Sayama
[He finds Kaoru at Serena. She sits at the counter.]

Kaoru: Oh… it’s you. Sorry, I kinda let myself in.

Kiryu: It’s fine.

[She takes a sip of beer. Kiryu lights a cigarette.]

Kaoru: What’s up? Got something you want to tell me?

Kiryu: Not really.

Kaoru: …Oh.

Kiryu: You’re headed back to Kansai?

Kaoru: Yeah. After all that I can’t leave Mama by herself. I wanna see her home safely.

Kiryu: Yeah. Good thinking.

Kaoru: Still, kinda feels like I’m running away at the climax here.

Kiryu: No, don’t worry about us.

Kaoru: I guess… You don’t need my protective custody now. (losing her shit) Dammit… I’m sorry…

Kiryu: You’re…

Kaoru: I’m scared.

Kiryu: Hm?

Kaoru: Of finding out anything else about all this. I’ve never felt this before. I was so eager to dig up my past… I thought I could handle whatever turned up. But… You hit the nail on the head. All it did was hurt. But hindsight is 20/20, right?

Kiryu: You’ll be fine.

Kaoru: Huh?

[Kiryu suddenly kisses her.]

Kiryu: What you find out doesn’t matter. I would never think less of you. So promise me… That whatever happens, you’ll come back. …Back here.

Kaoru: Okay… …I promise. Well, I… I’m going back to Osaka for now. I’ll head straight for the station and check out this disk, okay? I can’t imagine the system there having any trouble with it.

Kiryu: That’s good…

Kaoru: I don’t know what’s on this, but… No matter what it is… Even if it’s more pain… I’m ready to accept it.

Kiryu: ……

Kaoru: Hey.

Kiryu: Hm?

Kaoru: …Thank you. Alright, I’m off, then.

[She leaves. Kiryu phone’s ringing.]

Date: Hey, Kiryu.

Kiryu: What’s up?

Date: I just got word from Dr. Emoto. I guess Kazuki’s awake.

Kiryu: Really? That’s great to hear.

Date: Yeah, but apparently he’s talking a little crazy.

Kiryu: You mean he’s delirious?

Date: He’s been babbling about bombs… Anyway, I’m headed to the clinic. See you there?

Kiryu: Yeah.

[Kiryu goes to Emoto Clinic.]

Emoto: Hey, there you are.

Kiryu: Kazuki…

Kazuki: Kiryu-san… Sorry to drag you over here…

Kiryu: It’s fine. More importantly, how are you feeling?

Kazuki: Oh, much better, thanks.

Date: Kazuki… I’m sorry I got you into this mess.

Kazuki: Not at all. You saved me, Date-san.

Date: That’s a bit much.

Kazuki: No, I mean it. You freed me from those mafia thugs.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Kazuki: They had me locked up for the past six months.

Date: Six months!?

Yuya: Wha!? Then who was the Kazuki-san at the club!?

Kazuki: Yeah, that wasn’t me. It was the other guy. I could hardly believe it myself. I never imagined someone could look so similar… The other guy was a Korean…

Kiryu: One of the Jingweon, then?

Kazuki: Right. They jumped me outside the bar one night, and next thing I know, I’m a hostage.

Date: They were just using you to get to us…

Kazuki: Most likely. Kiryu-san, Date-san… I overheard them say some horrible things…

Kiryu: Like?

Kazuki: I didn’t get everything, but… They’re planning to destroy the city.

Date: What do you mean!?

Kazuki: There was more than one bomb. And the whole town’s already rigged to blow.

Date: What!?

Kazuki: They’ve been working on this for years.

Kiryu: Where are the other bombs?

Kazuki: All I know is how many there are.

Date: How many?

Kazuki: One of them said… "One bomb for each of the brothers we lost 26 years ago."

Date: Kiryu, the number of victims in that raid were…

Kiryu: It was 33.

Date: Then there are 33 bombs… One went off in the Millennium Tower… One we took care of along with Kurahashi…

Kiryu: That leaves 31.

Date: Kiryu, I’ll call the station to have them prep for bomb disposal.

Yuya: Bomb disposal!?

Date: Yeah, the bomb squad. Even if we find them, only a technician can disarm them safely.

Kiryu: Got it.

[Kiryu and Date walk out of the room.]

Kiryu: Date-san, I’ve got to go to Tojo Clan HQ.

Date: Why would you need to do that?

Kiryu: Tonight… The Go-Ryu Clan is going to hit Kamurocho with everything they’ve got.

Date: What? You’re sure?

Kiryu: Yes. And now more than ever, we need the Tojo Clan on our side. On the city’s side. The only way we save this town is if everyone does their part. Them too.

Date: Makes sense. Leave the bomb squad to me, then. …I’ll call you if anything comes up. Good luck.

Kiryu: Yeah.

[He takes a cab to Tojo HQ building.]

Yayoi: Thirty-one bombs!?

Kiryu: Yes, but we’re handling it. Date-san has the police mobilized to defuse the bombs. Our part in this is to protect the city from the Go-Ryu Clan invasion.

Yayoi: That’s fine in theory… But most of our officers are down. All our men are out there with no one to form the ranks….

Daigo: Kashiwagi-san, how many men could you pull together?

Kashiwagi: Let’s see… Local to Kamurocho, we could manage maybe 300…

Daigo: Kashiwagi-san… Will you trust me with those 300 men?

[Kashiwagi and Yayoi are shocked by his question.]

Kashiwagi: Yes. I’ll go make some calls.

[He leaves the room.]

Yayoi: You’ll take a stand for the Tojo Clan?

Daigo: Dad and Patriarch Kazama risked everything to keep this town safe. I’m not handing it over to Ryuji Goda now. The Go-Ryu Clan can’t have our city!

Kiryu: Daigo…

[Ryuji’s limo already driving Kanto’s roads… Tojo’s yakuza prepare their weapons… Daigo stands before them with his shirt off. There’s a generan with a katana on his back (just my guess).]

Daigo: All of you, listen up! Look… This isn’t just a Tojo Clan problem anymore. This fight is for every yakuza in Kanto.

Tojo Yakuza: Yes, sir!

Daigo: We grew up in this town. Some might say I have no right saying it, but I love this city. So I want to give something back to my town! As proud members of the Tojo Clan… Let’s show those Go-Ryu assholes they aren’t welcome in Kamurocho!

Tojo Yakuza: Yes, sir!

Kiryu: Nobody could object to Daigo taking over the Tojo Clan after this. (someone calls him) It’s me. Got it. I’ll head to Purgatory now.

Daigo: What is it?

Kiryu: That was Date. He says we’ve got trouble.

[He and Daigo return to Kamurocho.]

Kiryu: Let’s head to Purgatory. Date-san’s waiting for us there.

Daigo: Yeah… What do you think he wants? Something to do with the bombs?

Kiryu: I don’t know… But we should hurry.

Daigo: Right.

[They go to the underground city of Purgatory.]

Kiryu: What’s going on?

Date: HQ is going to sit this one out.

Kiryu: What…?

The Florist: Date here is still a wanted man. I guess tips from murder suspects don’t have much cred. Besides, Kazuki’s word is all we’ve got to go on that these 31 bombs even exist.

Date: The police won’t act without more solid proof. I knew that’d be a risk, but this is a new low…

Daigo: So you’re saying Kamurocho can’t be saved?

Kiryu: We’ll just have to do it ourselves. Put your 300 men to work on the bombs.

Daigo: What about the Go-Ryu?

Kiryu: I’ll handle them.

Daigo: Alone!?

Kiryu: Kamurocho’s a big place. It won’t be easy to find 31 bombs. But if anyone knows this city, it’s the Tojo Clan. They’ll find them. Leave the Go-Ryu Clan to me.

Daigo: …All right.

Date: Still, 31 of them… If only we knew where to even look..

The Florist: That’d be a cinch if the system here was up.

[Nearby, a crazy chant is heard. Majima enters.]

Majima: Look at this mopey bunch’a sad sacks!

Kiryu: Majima-san…

Majima: Kiryu-chan! Sounds like we’re pretty fucked, eh!? Okay! Outta my damn way.

[He hits the Florist’s table with his head (at least he is wearing a helmet).]

Majima: What the…

[He hits the table again…]

Kiryu: I don’t get it…

Majima: Ya said ya needed this system, didn’t ya!?

[He hits the table one more time…]

Majima: What is this shit!? What’s the goddamn problem!?

[He hits the table again and again…]

The Florist: Hey, you okay, man? …Should we stop him?

Daigo: Uh, probably…

[Kiryu trying to stop Majima.]

Majima: Go, ya fuck! I said fuckin’ go!

[With the last hit the platform on which the table stands starts to lower… into the old Florist Hideout…]

Majima: Wooo! Nailed it!

Daigo: What the hell!?

Date: Wh-What is…
Majima: Thought it might come in handy someday, so I kept the dust off.

The Florist: Hey… Not too shabby!

Majima: ’Course, I woulda been filthy rich with a get-up like this…

Kiryu: You just saved us, Majima-san!

Majima: Well, now it’s your turn. "Legendary" info-dealer-han.

The Florist:Yup, I’ll have those bombs pinpointed in no time.

Kiryu: (to Daigo) The rest is up to you.

Daigo: Right.

[Kiryu leves the hideout and got a call.]

Kiryu: This is Kiryu.
Barkeep: Kiryu-san! It’s the bartender over at Bantam!

Kiryu: What’s wrong!?

Barkeep: S-Some men from the Omi Alliance just…

Kiryu: Are they Go-Ryu!?

Barkeep: Y-Yes! They want to find you, and they’re… Ahh!

Kiryu: Are you okay!? Talk to me! Damn it!

[Kiryu rushes to Bantam. He got another call on the way.]

Emoto: Kiryu? This is Emoto.

Kiryu: What’s wrong? Are you okay?

Emoto: Some men claiming to be with the Go-Ryu Clan just busted into my clinic, and they’re hellbent on wrecking it. H-Hey! What are you doing!? S-Stop!

Kiryu: Doc…!? …They can’t drag innocent civilians into this!

[Soon he gets another call!]

Kiryu: Hello?

Yuya: Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: Yuya?

Yuya: It’s the Go-Ryu Clan! They’re…

Kiryu: Yuya!

Yuya: I-I’m okay. …We’ll do whatever we can here, Kiryu-san. You focus on stopping them!

Kiryu: All right. Do your best. I’ll be there soon as I can!

[When Kiryu comes out of Purgatory, Tamura runs up to him.]

Tamura: Huff… Huff… Kiryu-san! It’s terrible!

Kiryu: What’s wrong?

Tamura: The Go-Ryu Clan are raising hell all over town… It’s like an invasion! Nobody can stop them!

Kiryu: Yeah, I just got a call from the bartender down at Bantam. He said the Go-Ryu hit him too.

Tamura: If you don’t hurry, there won’t be a town to save!

Kiryu: I know.

[He rushes to Bantam.]

Go-Ryu Member: Finally decided to show up, Kazuma Kiryu? Almost gave up on waitin’ for ya! But now that you’re here… It’s time to die!

[Kiryu kicks their asses though it was not that easy.]

Kiryu: (The Go-Ryu are taking no prisoners… I have to stop them!) Barkeep, you all right?

Barkeep: Yes, somehow.. Kiryu-san, thank you so much! You best take care of yourself, you hear?

[Next, Kiryu runs to Emoto Clinic.]

Go-Ryu Member: Hey, thanks for comin’ to us, man! Must mean you’re ready to accept what comes next!

[Kiryu quickly deals with the young yakuzas.]

Kiryu: (I’m worried about Yuya, but hopefully he can hold his own a little longer. I’ve gotta make sure Yuya and Stardust are okay.) Hey, you okay?

Emoto: Yeah, thanks for the help. They’re still everywhere, though. You better be careful out there.

[Kiryu runs to Stardust. When he walks into the club several yakuza are kicking Kazuki on the floor and punches Yuya.]

Kiryu: Yuya! He had nothing to do with any of this! You came for me, didn’t you!?

Ryuji: Sure did. Figured if we waited here, you’d show up eventually. Took yer sweet time, though, huh?

Kiryu: Ryuji…!

Ryuji: Oh, if looks could kill! Wouldn’t be much fun if ya didn’t take this seriously. Good shit! Go nuts, boys!

[Kiryu shows the Go-Ryu Clan how brutal he can be. However… The many contractions in a row had exhausted him. Kiryu breathes heavily looking at Ryuji standing on the second floor.Ryuji draws his katana from its sheath and descends to the first floor. Kiryu drops to the knee.]

Yuya: Kiryu-san!

[Ryuji swings to kill Kiryu, but his hand stops at the last moment.]

Kiryu: What’s your game here?

Ryuji:If I take ya out like this… I don’t become the real dragon. ’Sides… You’ve got some unfinished business, don’t ya?

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Ryuji:The bombs, buddy.

Kiryu: You’re saying you didn’t put them up to it?

Ryuji:That one’s a Jingweon special. Wasn’t my idea. I got nothin’ to gain from this city burnin’ down.

Kiryu: What’s that supposed to mean?

Ryuji: Kamurocho’s gonna be mine soon. I want it lookin’ pretty for me. Who needs ashes?

Kiryu: Ryuji…

Ryuji: When you’re done, come on up to me. I ain’t gonna run or hide from this. I’ll wait for ya at the town’s highest point.

Kiryu: Fine.

Ryuji: No interruptions this time. Just you n’ me.

Kiryu: Right.

[Ryuji slowly walks away.]

Chapter 15: BLOOD AND BONDS
[Kiryu brings a glass of water to Yuya.]

Kiryu: Hey. Feeling a little better now?

Yuya: Yeah…

Kiryu: You held your own against the Go-Ryu Clan.

Yuya: Nah… Me n’ Kazuki-san both owe this town for everything we’ve got today. So I can’t stand it when someone tries to muscle their way in. Not that I could do a damn thing to stop them…

Yuya: That’s not true at all. You risked your life to protect this place.

Yuya: Kiryu-san… You guys are here working your butts off every night. It’s impressive. People like you keep Kamurocho going. Compared to you, I… I’m only of any use in times like these. Can you make it to the hospital?

Yuya: Yes.

[Daigo enters.]

Kiryu: Daigo?

Daigo: The Go-Ryu Clan did this?

Kiryu: Yeah.. I took care of them all, though.

Daigo: What about Ryuji Goda? Did you kill him?

Kiryu: No… I still have to settle things with him.

Daigo: I see…

Kiryu: How are those bombs coming?

Daigo: We’ve taken out 30 so far. Majima’s working on the last one as we speak.

Kiryu: Wait, Majima-san!?

[Meanwhile Majima and his subordinate tries to defuse the bomb without knowledge… proper tools… protection… and brains. There’s about 100 minutes left.]

Majima: The red one!

Subordinate: Yes, sir!

Majima: Neeeext… Let’s go blue!

Subordinate: Y-Yes, sir!

Majima: What’s up? Ya got gas or somethin’?

Subordinate: N-No sir… I was just thinking about my mother, back in the country.

Majima: What’s yer momma got to do with this bomb!?

Subordinate: No, it’s just… She lives by herself, so if something were to happen to me…

Majima: That’s why we’re stoppin’ it, numbnuts!

Subordinate: B-But, boss… Does doing this really tell you how the wiring works?

Majima: You for real!? How the fuck should I know how this tangly-ass rainbow shit works!? But we gotta handle it, so I’m here, puttin’ my instincts to work.

Subordinate: Instincts!? This is all instinct!?

Majima: What’s that? Ya don’t trust my instincts?

Subordinate: N-No… It’s not that, sir!

Majima: Then let’s get back to work!

Subordinate: Yes, sir! There’s only two left.

Majima: Yeah? Aww, fuck this! Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, oh-god-which-one-isn’t-gonna-blow? This one. Gimme red!

Subordinate: Boss! This is a life-or-death decision here! Can we take it a little more seriously!?

Majima: Shut it, nitwit! I said gimme red! Gimme those!

[He cuts the red cable himself and… everything explodes. Kaoru wakes up sitting on a computer in Osaka.]

Kaoru: …What an awful dream.

[She cracks the CD.]

Kaoru: Nice. Huh? Holy shit.

[Back to Kiryu.]

Kiryu: You really left Majima-san in charge of defusing a bomb?

Daigo: Yeah? He’s taking care of the last one as we speak.

Kiryu: You don’t know him like— Never mind. We’ve just got to trust him. I’m going back to Purgatory in the meantime.

Daigo: Got it.

[Kiryu takes a cab to Purgatory and finds Majma sitting on a crate. His subordinate massages his shoulders.]

Kiryu: Why’d I even worry, Majima-san?

Majima: Man, I’m on fire today! My instincts are the real deal, yeah

Subordinate: Y-Yes, sir!

Kiryu: (bows) Thank you.

Majima: Enough of that! Not like any of this was hard. It was half for shits n’ giggles anyway. Well, I’m famished. Work makes me so damn hungry, y’know?

Subordinate: Yes, sir!

Majima: So Kiryu-chan, the rest is up to you. Later. Oh, and Kiryu-chan… (seriously) Lose to that Ryuji clown, and I’ll straight up ruin ya. I still want another showdown.

Kiryu: All right.

Date: I can’t stop you from taking on Ryuji, can I?

Kiryu: Sayama’s coming back tonight. After that, I’m going after him alone. So while we wait… I’m gonna go enjoy the city with Haruka.

Date: Kiryu, I’ve got something to tell you. Can you meet me at Serena later?

Kiryu: Sure, but can’t you just tell me now?

Date: Sorry, but this isn’t the time or the place. And I’m a little busy right now myself.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Date: I’ll give you a call when I’m done. Why don’t you take Haruka out for a bit in the meantime? Poor girl has been on pins and needles waiting for you.

Kiryu: Yeah, you’re right…

Date: I talk to you soon.

[Kiryu and Haruka have a good time shopping and eating and playing. Time flies. Kiryu got a call from Date.]

Kiryu: This is Kiryu.

Date: It’s me. I just finished up my preparations. Can you swing by Serena when you get a chance? There’s something I need to say before Sayama gets back into town.

Kiryu: All right.

[Kiryu and Haruka go back to Serena.]

Kiryu: You’re with Division One…

Sudo: (bows) It’s been a while.

Kiryu: What brings you out here?

Sudo: Yes, well…

Date: Haruka… We need to talk with Kiryu real quick. Can you wait outside for a sec?

Haruka: Okay, sure.

[She goes outside.]

Date: You need to see this. I made a copy of Kurahashi’s disc and had Sudo analyze it too.

Kiryu: These are…

Date: Sayama and Ryuji Goda’s records. Note the name listed under Ryuji’s parents.

Kiryu: Suyeon Jung… No way…

Date: Kaoru Sayama and Ryuji Goda share the same mother.

Kiryu: Which means…

[Kaoru suddenly enters.]

Kaoru: I made it back. What is it? Why’s everyone look like death?

Kiryu: Nothing…

Date: You haven’t met, have you? This is Superintendent Sudo, Chief of Tokyo’s Division Four.

Sudo: Nice to meet you.

Kaoru: Nice to meet you. Assistant Inspector Kaoru Sayama, Osaka Division Four.

Sudo: Well, I need to get back to work. Excuse me.

Date: Sure.

[Sudo takes the documents and leaves.]

Kaoru: Why was the Division Four chief here?

Date: He came by to ask me about the bomb scare.

Kaoru: What happened with the bombs?

Kiryu: We dismantled all of them.

Kaoru: Oh… That’s great news.

Date: What about that disk from Kurahashi?

Kaoru: Not even the system at HQ could crack it.

Date: I see…

[Date and Kiryu quickly notice that she’s lying.]

Kaoru: And the Go-Ryu Clan?

Kiryu: I managed to beat them back. All that’s left is Ryuji.

Kaoru: Just him?

Kiryu: That’s right. He wants to settle things with me, so he pulled back.

Kaoru: Where is he?

Kiryu: The highest point in Kamurocho… That’s where he’s waiting for me.

Date: Kamurocho Hills, I guess?

Kiryu: Most likely.

Kaoru: And you’re going?

Kiryu: Yeah. I don’t see any way around this fight.

Kaoru: I forbid it.

Kiryu: What?

Kaoru: I’m Division Four’s lead detective here. I can’t turn a blind eye to a man saying he plans to fight someone to the death.

Date: How can you say that now!?

Kaoru: Because I’m saying it as an officer of the law!

Kiryu: I see… But I’m still going. I wouldn’t make presumptions.

Kaoru: You’re still in my custody. I can arrest you any time.

Kiryu: Then do it.

Kaoru: You’re going anyway?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Kaoru: Fine. Then there’s somewhere I want you to go first.

Kiryu: Where?

Kaoru: My chief’s in town at Tokyo PD. He has something to tell you.

Kiryu: What? Bessho-san’s here?

Kaoru: Yeah. The Omi’s Takashima Family is acting odd. That’s probably it. So? Will you meet with him?

Kiryu: Yeah… That’s fine.

Kaoru: Alright, head to Tokyo PD.

Kiryu: Police headquarters?

Kaoru: Yeah, the chief said he’d be waiting in Archive Room 13 on the 3rd floor basement.

Date: What the hell?

Kaoru: You know the place, Date-san?

Date: I guess you could say that.

Kiryu: All right. Archive Room 13, right?

Kaoru: Yep… Thanks.

Date: If you’re heading to Tokyo PD, nl go with you. I know the place, and it’s… probably better that way.

Kiryu: Yeah, thanks.

[They go to Tokyo PD.]

Date: Sayama was acting funny, don’t you think?

Kiryu: Yeah…

Date: Think something happened in Kansai? Kinda strange that Osaka’s Division Four chief would ask us down here too. Hm? There’s nobody here… Wait, that’s…

[He finds a computer… notebook actually.]

Kiryu: What is it?

[Date brings the computer out of standby mode and sees Kaoru on the screen.]

Date: It’s… Sayama!?

Kaoru: (on video) There, that looks good. Umm, hi. Sorry for the wild goose chase. I’m recording this now just in case anything happens to me. I wanted to tell you everything I know and how I feel about it. So please… Just hear me out. I finally cracked Kurahashi’s disk using Osaka PD’s system. I learned a lot from it. Ryuji Goda and I are… We’re half-siblings by blood. I think Kawara-san… Er, my dad, rescued a young Ryuji Goda from the fire that night. To think, now my only living family member is Ryuji Goda… Talk about ironic, eh? I grew up hating organized crime, and my brother’s a yakuza. Anyway, all I can do now is talk to him. Try to get him to stop this stupid war. As his only blood relative… And as a Division Four detective. Everything we talked about… The time we spent in Osaka… I know I’ll never forget it. I’ll keep it in my heart, always. It’ll be my one and only memory of you… But I’m fine with that. We’re just… The worlds we live in are so different. I never should’ve let you in like I did. Just goes to show… how special you are. (cries) Sorry… I meant to say goodbye with a smile! I’m keeping that promise, though. I’m done running from my fate. …Goodbye.

Date: Sayama…

[Kiryu brutally hits the table and walks briskly toward the exit. He is consumed by a ferocious rage.]

Chapter 16: DECISION
[We’re back at Serena. Date and Kiryu talking about what to do next.]

Date: I think we both know where Sayama went…

Kiryu: Yeah, Kamurocho Hills.

Date: …You’re going, aren’t you?

Kiryu: Yeah… It’s time to put an end to this.

Date: You’re right. Once Ryui Goda is taken care of, the fighting stops. But that means he’s got nothing to lose. He’ll fight you with everything he’s got. You better be ready for that. But that means he’s got nothing to lose. Hell fight you with everything he’s got. You better be ready for that.

Kiryu: I know.

Date: Come see me before you go. And take your time getting ready.

[Kiryu prepares for the brutal final battle… by eating a burger at the nearest diner.]

Date: Kiryu… There’s no turning back after this. You’re sure you’re ready?

Kiryu: Yeah, I’m ready.

Date: Okay. I’ll watch Haruka for you. Don’t worry about her.

Kiryu: Thanks, Date-san. I know she’s in good hands.

[He leaves Serena. Some Jingweon mafioso greets him right away.]

Jingweon Mafioso: [Hey, it’s Kiryu! C’mon, this way!]

Kiryu: (rushes at them) Let’s go!

Jingweon Mafioso: [Die!]

[Kiryu rushes through Kamurocho punching the shit out of Korean mafiosos. He climbs to the top of Kamurocho Hills, which is under construction, where he finds Kaoru holding a gun on Ryuji.]

Kiryu: Kaoru!

Kaoru: Kazuma…

Ryuji: Ya wanna fill me in on this, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Ryuji…

Kaoru: Don’t move! Hand over Chairman Goda!

Ryuji: He’s over there… Knock yerself out.

[Kiryu runs to the old man.]

Kiryu: Chairman!

[He unties him.]

Kiryu: He’s okay!

Ryuji: So? What bring ya up here, lady?

Kaoru: You do. I came to arrest you.

Ryuji: (smirks) Little late, ain’t ya? You’re in knee-deep with the Tojo Clan. Hardly an angel yourself, eh?

Kaoru: I agree. I’ll be turning myself in alongside ya. I’ll be joining you, in jail or wherever.

Ryuji: The hell?

Kaoru: I’m done watchin’ my family die.

Ryuji: Yer family? Ya got a screw loose, lady?

Kaoru: Ryuji Goda… You remember it, don’t you? Bein’ rescued from a burning building.

Ryuji: So what if I do!?

Kaoru: Don’t ya know what that means? You’re one of the Jingweon Mafia survivors.

Ryuji: And what the fuck of it!?

Kaoru: Ya wouldn’t know this, but Suyeon Jung… Your mother was still alive. She took a new name. Shoko Kawara. My mother. You and I… We share Suyeon’s blood, making us brother and sister!

Ryuji: Wha… What the fuck is this!?

Kaoru: I came here to help you. As your sister. And… as a cop. So please, stop this fighting! Ryuji Goda-san… You’re under arrest.

Ryuji: Bullshit… I’ve got… a little sister?

Jin Goda: The lady’s tellin’ the truth. I’m sorry I never told you, Ryuji… I just couldn’t. 26 years ago, Suyeon came to Kansai, and we got acquainted. It was at a little bar in Sotenbori. It was pure luck I met her there. Heard her story… The mafia was gettin’ closer every day… And she was exhausted tryin’ to keep her baby safe. I was livin’ comfortable enough. I offered to help, hopin’ to make her life easier. After that, I took her in. But then… This cop named Kawara transferred down to Kansai, lookin’ for her. He took Suyeon away from me…

Kaoru: My father, you mean.

Jin Goda: That’s right. Not that I blamed her. In the end, I’m still a yakuza. I knew Suyeon was only with me to survive.

Ryuji: So you’re sayin’… My own mama threw me away.

Jin Goda: No! It was at my request. As Suyeon left, I begged her to leave you. You were a real son to me. More.

Ryuji: Shut up! Why the fuck should I care now!?

Jin Goda: Ryuji…

Ryuji: All my life, I’ve been alone… Thinkin’ of nothing but surpassin’ the renowned yakuza, Jin Goda. I went so far as workin’ with those Jingweon fucks to make this war happen.

Jin Goda: You… do still remember that night, then.

Ryuji: What’s it matter? I don’t give a shit about revenge or their stupid grudge. Our goals aligned. That’s all. And now… You’re the only thing left!

[Kiryu walks in.]

Kaoru: Hold it! I’m not done talkin’ here!

Kiryu: Ryuji Goda… I have you pegged. You’re exactly the man I thought you were. Whatchya mean by that?

Kiryu: You can’t change the way you live. Your instincts drive you, and you act on them.

Ryuji: Heh. You don’t know me.

Kiryu: You remind me of an old friend… He chose to fight to give meaning to his life. A man like that deserves everything I’ve got.

[He pushes the button locking himself and Ryuji in the freight elevator.]

Kaoru: Kazuma!

Kiryu: Kaoru… Sorry.

Ryuji: It’s set! On the field of battle, the yakuza flower… Now in full bloom!

[He takes off his shirt revealing his dragon. Kiryu does the same.]

Ryuji: (unsheaths his katana) Ya better be ready…

[And IT’S ON! KAZUMA KIRYU VS GO-RYU CLAN PATRIARCH, RYUJI GODA!! Not without effort, Kiryu manages to defeat the pumped-up Ryuji. Exhausted, he falls to the floor. Jin Goda arrives at the scene of the fight in his wheelchair.]

Kiryu: Chairman… (bows) I’m sorry.

Jin Goda: No… It’s better this way. Thanks to you, I finally got to hear how Ryuji truly feels. Honestly… Thank you very much.

Kiryu: Chairman Goda…

Jin Goda: I hid the only things that really mattered to Ryuji… I feared he would up n’ leave me if he ever learned the truth. Sayama-san…

Kaoru: Yes?

Jin Goda: As Ryuji’s father, it falls on me to take responsibility for the crimes of my son.

Kaoru: Chairman…

Jin Goda: I’ve carried the Omi sigil this far… I wanna end things the right way. Take me in alongside Ryuji.

Familiar Voice: Well done… Chairman Goda, Kiryu-san… It’s impressive how faithfully you’ve followed my script.

Kiryu: No way… I know that voice… Terada…!

Jin Goda: What’s the meaning of this!?

Terada: This is the tapestry I set out to paint… And it took me 26 years to see it realized.

Kaoru: That means, you’re…!

Terada: Exactly. I am Daejin Kim. The final survivor of the raid 26 years ago.

Kiryu: Still… Why would you fake your own death?

Terada: You are not a man moved by reason. Dying was the only sure way to bait you into action.

Kiryu: Why go that far for me?

Terada: If you moved, the Omi would respond in kind. The stage was set for a war between Kanto and Kansai. So goes the first act…

Kiryu: That means… you fed me that line about the oath to put Ryuji in play?

Terada: Yes… Ryuji would never allow the Omi Alliance to ally with the Tojo Clan. Naturally he staged a coup d’état, then set his sights on Kanto. …Only to be defeated by you. Also part of the plan, I might add.

Kiryu: So Ryuji was one of your targets too?

Terada: Right again. He turned his back on our creed… So of course. He refused to rejoin his Jingweon brethren. He didn’t care about the grudge left to fester for 26 years. All he cared about was the view from the top. So I used that knowledge to make him uphold our creed and die for our cause.

Kiryu: Terada…!

Terada: Kiryu-san… Once you’re out of the picture… The Tojo Clan will crumble, and it will all be over.

[He gives the sign and some Jingweon mafiosos approaches. Even the traitor is among them.]

Terada: (smokes a cigarette) It’s taken ages… But it’s done. I lived for 26 years as Yukio Terada. But that, too, is almost over… Once you’re dead, I’ll end it with the switch for the explosives.

Kiryu: Explosives!?

Terada: (smirks) You hadn’t noticed? It’s been right in front of your noses.

Kaoru: But how!?

Kiryu: All the bombs were disarmed!

Terada: This one is for Kurahashi. The man killed by your father, Jiro Kawara. You took the life of a comrade… A friend. So I’ve prepared this to make you answer for that. I press this button, and Kamurocho drowns in a sea of flames.

Kaoru: Are you insane!?

Terada: Oh, don’t worry. By the time this goes off, you won’t be around to care.

Kiryu: Terada…

Terada: What is it?

Kiryu: Just answer this. Those words you said… In front of Kazama-san’s grave. Was that all a lie?

Terada: What does it matter?

Kiryu: 26 years ago… The man who saved you… Was it not Kazama-san!?

Terada: What!? How could you know…?

Kiryu: I was there 26 years ago… And I saw you.

[We plunge into that fateful night again. Terada and Kurahashi with some other Jingweon members hiding behind a desk.]

Young Terada: [Yeongmin, what do we do!?]

Young Kurohashi: [Shit! We’re no match for them…]

[Unable to contain the tension, one of the members of the mafia runs out of hiding.]

Young Terada: [Ko..!]

[Shimano kills him and leaves.]

Young Terada: [All right… Let’s move. We’ll go down fighting, for Ko!]

Young Kurohashi: [If we can get him from behind…]

[But Kazama finds them in a second. Terada and Kurohashi tremble in fear. Kazama lowers his guns.]

Kazama: Live.

Young Terada: Huh?

Kazama: You boys are still young. Don’t waste your lives. Live.

[Young Kiryu witnesses this. They meet Young Terada’s glance. We’re back to the present.]

Terada: I see… So you were the boy. It’s true. Yeongmin and I lived through the night ’cause of Kazama-san.

Kiryu: Terada…

Terada: Even so, I struck at Kazama-san to avenge my fallen brothers. Again and again… Yet he still looked after me. To the point of leading me to the Omi.

Jin Goda: I see… That explains why. After you swore to the Omi… A Dojima man named Kazama came to ask me to watch over you. He begged me on his hands and knees…

Kiryu: Terada… Kazama-san did all of that and more for you. Don’t you have any shred of humanity?

Terada: Kiryu-san, I fear ya don’t get it yet. I’m a member of the Jingweon Mafia. The creed takes precedence over all else… (squeezes his cigarette in a fist) Even if it means killing our own parents. Such is our fate.

Kiryu: Those aren’t the words of a human…

Terada: Right. Our organization has forsaken humanity. How else could we possibly live for 26 years for the sole purpose of revenge? In any case, you’re just an obstacle now! Kiryu-san… You’re going to die! Let’s put an end to this.

[He reloads an UZI. Terada or Haejin Kim as he’s known to us now, attack Kiryu with a bunch of his men. The battle turns out to be fierce, with truth and victory on Kiryu’s side.]

Terada: Kiryu… This isn’t over…! (falls on the floor)

Kiryu: No, this is where your "script" ends.

[However… Someone is shooting at Kiryu… in the same place he was just recently stabbed…]

Kaoru: Kazuma!

Terada: You’re late…

Jin Goda: Takashima!

Takashima: I really must thank you. You’ve cleared people out of my way, one after the next.

[Kaoru wants to help Kiryu…]

Kiryu: Stay back!

Takashima: Please don’t move. You’ve done well. Leave the rest to me.

Jin Goda: So you were behind all this!?

[Takashima shots the old man in the shoulder and shots the gun out of Kaoru’s hand.]

Kiryu: K-Kaoru!

Takashima: You’re correct, Chairman. Terada authored this script according to my vision.

Jin Goda: …You’d betray the Omi Alliance? To sell us to the Jingweon!?

Takashima: Betrayal? Are you really that dense?

Terada: Takashima’s goals mirrored the Jingweon’s. We both wanted to crush the Tojo Clan.

Takashima: Exactly. And that’s all but accomplished now. Therefore… You’re no longer necessary.

[He shots Terada in the heart.]

Kiryu: Terada!

Takashima: (laughs) He never saw I was playing him all along! What a fool!

Terada: I knew it… you snake…

Jin Goda: Takashima, you—

[Takashima shots Jin Goda in the second shoulder.]

Jin Goda: T-Takashima… What of the Omi…? What… will you do?

Takashima: Oh, rest assured. I’ll pick it up where you left off.

Jin Goda: I… won’t… …Allow it!

[Takashima shot him the third time. Right in the heart.]

Takashima: I’ll tell you before you go… I plan to become the sixth chairman of the Omi Alliance and absorb the Tojo Clan. I will rule over our nation’s yakuza. Then I’ll use the Jingweon Mafia to spread to the mainland. That’s how the script really ends.

Jin Goda: Y-You..

[He spits some blood and dies.]

Kiryu: Goda-san…!

Takashima: (laughs) All of your stupidity knows no bounds! Why do you trust people like this!? It’s ludicrous!

Terada: I-I never did… In my heart… I knew… something was off about you.

Takashima: What, you’re still alive? Your role is done.

Terada: Your plan… won’t end… how you think…. Soon… you’ll see…!

Takashima: You people talk too much.

[He shots Terada a couple of times.]

Terada: Kiryu-san… It’s just you… and… This bastard… Stop him… (pushes the button)

Kiryu: Terada…!

Terada: I-In the end… Trust me…

[He dies.]

Takashima: What!?

[A bomb opens its shell. The timer says 10 minutes.]

Takashima: Shit! What have you done, you idiot!?

[He stuffs Terada’s dead body with bullets. Stupid Kaoru pulls out a folding baton and runs at Takashima screaming. He has no problem taking her hostage. Kiryu grabs a gun.]

Takashima: Move an inch, and I won’t hesitate to shoot…

Kaoru: Forget about me! Shoot!

Kiryu: Kaoru…!

Kaoru: Kazuma, you gotta shoot him! Just shoot, please!

Takashima: Kazuma Kiryu… You can’t do it. You can’t bear to make sacrifices. That’s what makes you weak.

[He shots Kiryu in the shoulder.]

Kaoru: Kazuma!

Takashima: Goddamn fool… (to Kaoru) And now it’s your turn… Die.

[But… Ryuji wakes up and shoots Takashima.]

Kiryu: Ryuji…!

[Ryuji fires a full clip at Takashima. Takashima also manages to shoot several times, but Ryuji doesn’t pay much attention to it. Takashima falls near the bomb.]

Takashima: To think I let… an idiot like you… Get the better… of me…

Ryuji: A real man… oughta be a little stupid. Schemin’ fuck like you… Could never stand on top…

[He finishes Takashima off with a shot in his head.]

Ryuji: (panting like a beast) Ain’t room for… more than one dragon.

Kiryu: Yeah… You’re right.

Kiryu: Wait! What are you doin’!? That bomb is ticking! We got five minutes ’til it blows!

Ryuji: Damn… I’m fadin’ out here. Gotta hurry… and settle this.

Kaoru: We need to get outta here! Stop it! We’ve gotta go!

Kiryu: I’m not going.

Kaoru: What!?

[He closes the doors of the freight elevator again.]

Kiryu: You better go. Live your life. I still have something to do.

Ryuji: This guy. I’m seein’ now… For real… How my sister fell for ya. He’s right, though. Get outta here, fast.

Kaoru: Wh-What are you saying!? I can’t watch any more family die! I can’t watch the man I love die!

Kiryu: I know.

Kaoru: Then c’mon, let’s—

Ryuji: Shut up, goddammit! Hey… We’re fallin’ apart here. It don’t even matter. We got… no time left.

Kaoru: (crying) B-But…!

Ryuji: (to Kaoru) It’s a once-in-a-lifetime request… Can ya do your brother… this one favor?

[Kaoru bursts into tears. Ryuji takes her down the elevator.]

Ryuji: Alright… The clock’s tickin’. Ya ready? Let’s go.

Kiryu: Yeah… I won’t hold back. C’mon!

[THE FINAL BATTLE!! FOR REAL THIS TIME!! RYUJI VS KIRYU!! After the fight Kaoru rushes in. She takes the stairs!]

Kaoru: Why…

Ryuji: (to Kaoru) Ya… smell nice. Same as… Mom did. Do ya… remember her at all?

Kaoru: …Nope.

Ryuji: Ya don’t? Sorry to hear it. Lost her before ya were… old enough to even remember.

Kaoru: What was… What was she like?

Ryuji: You look… a lot like her. First time I laid eyes on ya… I thought o’ her. I got an… adorable li’l sister here. If only… I’d… known.

Kaoru: Maybe we coulda avoided all this, huh?

Ryuji: Nah… Got too much Jingweon blood in me… Death woulda found me one way or another…. Not bad… Made it further in I thought. Hey… Gimme a smile. Mom’s face… when she laughed… …was great.

Kaoru: (smiles) Brother…

Ryuji: (laughs) There’s… that smile.

[Ryuji dies. Kaoru bursts into tears. There’s 3 minutes and 25 seconds left on the timer. A helicopter flies in.]

Sudo: There’s not much time!

Date: (via loudspeaker) Kiryu, can you hear me!? It’s gonna blow! Get out of there!

Haruka: Uncle Kaz!

[But… Kiryu falls on the floor. He lost too much blood.]

Kaoru: Kazuma…! We’ve gotta get outta here, now!

Kiryu: You go… Run…

Kaoru: What are you saying!?

Kiryu: I can barely… move…

Kaoru: Don’t you give up! I’ll carry you if I have to!

Kiryu: You need to save yourself!

Kaoru: Fine then. I’m stayin’ here with you.

Kiryu: What?

Kaoru: I’m not gonna just leave you!

Kiryu: Forget about me…

Kaoru: I won’t do that!

Kiryu: Hurry… Hurry…! Get out!

Kaoru: Then c’mon, let’s—

Ryuji: Shut up, goddammit! Hey… We’re fallin’ apart here. It don’t even matter. We got… no time left.

Kaoru: (crying) B-But…!

Ryuji: (to Kaoru) It’s a once-in-a-lifetime request… Can ya do your brother… this one favor?

Kiryu: Hurry… Hurry…! Get out!

Kaoru: Shut up! I said I’m staying with you!

Kiryu: Kaoru…

[They kiss. Two minutes after… (and I’m not even joking, they show us the timer).]

Date: (via loudspeaker) Kiryu, can you hear me!? Get out of there!!

Sudo: Date-san, it’s too dangerous to get closer! There’s no time! …We’ve got to pull back!

Date: Kiryu…

Haruka: Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Less than a minute left…

Kaoru: Poor Haruka-chan… We let her down.

Kiryu: We really did. But at least I know she’ll understand.

Kaoru: You’re right… She’s a smart girl.

Kiryu: Are you scared?

Kaoru: Yeah… But I’ve never felt so warm before.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Kaoru: Thank you.

[The clock ticking… every second is like a minute… CREDITS.]

[After 10 minutes of waiting we see Haruka preying in the cemetery just like in the beginning of the game.]

Haruka: Thank you. I’ll… never forget you.

[On the gravestone we see the name… 寺田行雄 (Yukio Terada).]

Haruka: Terada-san… Thank you so much.

[Kiryu and Date standing nearby.]

Date: The whole time, the bomb was a fake… I guess Terada wins best actor after all.

Kiryu: Yeah… He wasn’t lying when he said he could never have trusted Takashima…

Date: I guess not.

[He pulls out a fuse that fell out of the dying Terada’s pocket.]

Date: He didn’t have the fuse in there to begin with. He never intended for the thing to go off. Still, gives me the shivers to even think about that bomb blowing…

Kiryu: Yeah… If Terada hadn’t done that though, Takashima would have gotten his way.

Date: Wait… Did you know the bomb wouldn’t go off the whole time?

Kiryu: No… I didn’t. But the last thing he said was, "Trust me."

Date: Trust him about what, though, I wonder?

Kiryu: If I had to guess… About the way he felt toward Kazama-san. Now that I think about it.

Date: …Makes enough sense. So in a way, he wasn’t lying.

Kiryu: Yeah…

[Someone approaches them.]

Haruka: Ah…!

[It’s Kaoru. She brings some flowers to honor the dead.]
