DEAD SPACE 2

[Interference appears on the screen. When it ends, we see Nicole Brennan from the previous game on a video link with her boyfriend Isaac Clarke.]

Nicole Brennan: Isaac, are you there? (chanting) Come in Isaac…

[The image from Isaac’s webcam appears on the screen. It looks like he was asleep.]

Nicole Brennan: Oh God. I’m so sorry, Isaac… look at the time difference… I’ll call you back later…

Isaac Clarke: (in sleepy voice) No, no, it’s ok. It’s ok. How you doing?

Nicole Brennan: Good. You were right, Isaac! The Ishimura is a great ship! I am so lucky to be serving aboard her.

Isaac Clarke: Well enjoy it while it lasts. You know they’re going to decommission her next year.

Nicole Brennan: Isaac… thank you.

Isaac Clarke: For what?

Nicole Brennan: For just pushing me to do this. I mean, If it weren’t for you, I never would have made it this far, because you made me stick with it…

Isaac Clarke: Well, just remember, I’m giving you up for six months so you can do this.

Nicole Brennan: You know what we must be getting out of range of the relay.(video begins to distort) Isaac? I… Isaac… Can you hear me? Look, I’m gonna call you back as soon as I can.

[A doctor tries to get through to Isaac. Apparently Isaac is in a mental institution - he is wearing a straitjacket. The video link he just had appears to be just a memory of his.]

Psychiatrist: Isaac, Isaac! You were drifting away for a moment there, Mr. Clarke. I believe you were telling me about your nightmares that you’ve been having - about your dead girlfriend. What was her name?

Isaac Clarke: Nicole.

[Nicole’s ghost sits on the bedside table right behind the psychiatrist’s back.]

Ghost of Nicole: I didn’t want it to end like this. I really wanted to see you again… just once. I loved you. I always loved you.

Psychiatrist: Yes. Nicole Brennan. She was a senior medical officer stationed aboard a Planetcracker class vessel.

Isaac Clarke: …The Ishimura.

Psychiatrist: The USG Ishimura, yes. Part of a mining operation on Aegis VII. I understand communications went down shortly after their arrival. You were part of the repair mission -- a mission for which you volunteered, am I right? What did you find aboard that ship, Isaac?

Isaac Clarke: They found something.

Psychiatrist: What did they find aboard that ship, Isaac?

Isaac Clarke: The Marker.

[Nicole’s ghost and the Marker appear right before Isaac’s eyes. Nicole’s ghost slowly walks toward him.]

Psychiatrist: Did you have contact with this… Marker? It made you see things, didn’t it? Things you didn’t want to see.

Isaac Clarke: It spoke to me…

Psychiatrist: What did it say, Isaac? What did it say to you, Isaac?

[Nicole’s ghost climbs onto the psychiatrist’s desk. Her face is covered in blood. She speaks the words slowly and eerily.]

Ghost of Nicole: Make us whole!

[Nicole’s Ghost’s eyes and mouth begin to emit a bright white glow.]

Psychiatrist: Isaac! Isaac! Can you hear me? Isaac?

Ghost of Nicole: MAKE US WHOLE!

[The screen flashes with a white light that transforms into a flashlight when the game shows you another scene. Some black-skinned guy shines a flashlight in Isaac’s face in his ward.]

Black Guy: Isaac? Isaac, can you hear me? Daina, I found Isaac Clarke! Repeat. I have him!

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Great work, Franco. Be careful, he’s been out a long time.

Franco Delille: Good, good. Steady, steady, steady. We gotta get you out of this straightjacket.

Isaac Clarke: Where, where am I?

Franco Delille: Alright. I know you’re confused right now. I can explain everything, but you gotta trust me, okay? Listen! You’re in terrible, terrible danger!

[At this point, Franco is attacked by a necromorph and stabs his head. Franco immediately begins to transform. While this is happening, Isaac pushes him away and leaves the ward.]

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Franco? Franco, what happened? Oh God… Isaac? Isaac Clarke!? If you can hear me, run. RUN!

[It turns out to be very dark indoors. Necromorphs are everywhere. Isaac runs through them as fast as he can. On his way he encounters a soldier who opens fire on him without warning.]

Soldier: Clarke! Take him down!

[However, he is immediately killed by the necromorph, who drags him into the vent and after a while spits out the mutilated remains.]

Director Hans Tiedemann: (via loudspeakers) This is Director Tiedemann to all project personnel. I want the key subjects terminated and the facility scrubbed. This is not a drill. Tiedemann out.

[Isaac walks into a room with many computers. One of them is looping a video interview with one of the patients.]

Psychiatrist 2: (on video) Subject is Nolan Stross - Session one-five-eight. Now… The eye is looking much better today? Yes, don’t you think?

Nolan Stross: (on video) It hurts. Still h-hurts.

Psychiatrist 2: (on video) Yes, I’ll schedule you for another session tomorrow.

Nolan Stross: (on video) No… no, no… I… I don’t think I’m ready… I don’t think I can take another session. I don’t…

Psychiatrist 2: (on video) There… First thing tomorrow. Now let’s talk about what you saw today. Come on, Stross. I’m here to help you.

Nolan Stross: (on video) It was black. Deep black, and glowing red, with symbols… symbols that… whispered to me.

Psychiatrist 2: (on video) And what did the symbols whisper to you? Come on, Stross, what…

Nolan Stross: (on video) …It was just a shard - it was just a shard… but it put so much stuff in my head… so much… shit in my head… There’s no more room… for anything I can’t remember what she looks like… Why can’t I remember what she looks like?

Psychiatrist 2: (on video) The symbols, Stross. What did the symbols tell you?

Nolan Stross: (on video) They tell me it wasn’t my fault… I didn’t kill them… They didn’t deserve this and I didn’t deserve this!!! Fucker…

Psychiatrist 2: (on video) Put Mr. Stross back in stasis. Adjust his medication up 30 milligrams and we’ll try another session first thing in the morning.

[Isaac moves on. Soon he sees the psychiatrist standing with his back to him. As Isaac passes by, the psychiatrist attacks him with a scalpel.]

Isaac Clarke: Come on man.

Psychiatrist 3: Patient Four… I remember you… Tiedemann said we all the key subjects… (mad laughs) need to be eliminated… terminated… (mad laughs) what’s one more?

Isaac Clarke: Listen to me man!

Psychiatrist 3: …will it matter?

Isaac Clarke: Listen to me!

Psychiatrist 3: Will it matter?!

Isaac Clarke: We can both get out of here. Just, just cut me out of this straightjacket!

Psychiatrist 3: No one’s getting out of here alive -- no one.

Isaac Clarke: Don’t do it!

[The Psychiatrist cuts… and frees Isaac.]

Psychiatrist 3: There is no escaping from what I’ve done.

Isaac Clarke: Take it easy buddy… just take it easy.

Psychiatrist 3: Your RIG is red. It’s red. There’s a health pack and a flashlight in that wall locker. You should grab them. Go ahead. Take it. I won’t be needing it anymore.

[Isaac grabs and uses the health pack.]

Psychiatrist 3: Isaac… We’re all gonna burn for what we did to you.

[He cuts his throat. Isaac picks up a flashlight and goes to the Patient Rec Room.]

Chapter 1
Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Clarke! Isaac Clarke, is that you?

Isaac Clarke: Who are you?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) My name is Daina. I’m the one trying to rescue you…

Isaac Clarke: Why? What’s going on?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) You’re suffering from a unique form of dementia Isaac, something you contracted on Regis VII.

Isaac Clarke: How do you know that? How do you know all this about me?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Your dementia will kill you. But if you can get here I can treat you and get you to safety.

Isaac Clarke: Why should I trust you?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Because I’m not the one shooting at you.

Isaac Clarke: Fuck.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Just follow the route I’m sending you.

[Isaac walks down the technical corridor. At some point his head begins to buzz and his eyes blur. He hears a voice.]

Ghost of Nicole: Isaac…

Isaac Clarke: What the hell?!

[Isaac goes further and gains access to a service tunnel to get around the blockage.]

Computer: Welcome. CEC Engineer… Isaac Clarke. Access Granted.

[Eventually the bottom of the tunnel fails and Isaac falls into some patient’s ward.]

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Isaac, what happened, are you alright?

Isaac Clarke: Why are you helping me?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) If Tiedemann finds you more people will die.

Isaac Clarke: Including me.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Not if you follow my route.

Isaac Clarke: I don’t like this.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) You don’t have to like it. Just hurry, before you get locked in!

[Isaac disassembles the panel of the patient undergoing kinetic therapy (the patient is long dead by then) and builds a kinetic module. He uses it to pick up a fragment of the chair the patient was lying in and dismantle the window of the ward. Several necromorphs attack Isaac, but he hurls pipes at them, piercing them through and moves on. Soon he is out in the surgical ward. There is a man lying on the operating room table. He is screaming in horror and pain, because his abdomen has been opened - the operation has not been completed. Isaac rushes to help.]

Patient: Help! Help! Help me! Please. God, somebody help me! Can anyone hear me? I can hear you, come help me please! Oh God, I’m all alone in here. Where did everyone go? Help! Help!

[Isaac approaches the surgical equipment.]

Patient: You! You! Thank God, please, come help me! Are you a doctor?

Isaac Clarke: Calm down. I’ll cut you out of there. Is that a tissue laser? A plasma cutter?

[A necromorph enters the ward.]

Patient: Oh my God!

Isaac Clarke: Fuck.

[He breaks the equipment and uses the laser. The patient tries to push the monster away with his legs.]

Patient: What the fuck are you doing? Oh shit! Help! Help!

Isaac Clarke: I’m trying. I’m trying!

[Isaac does not have time to save the patient. He kills the necromorph with two precise shots, severing his limbs. Once he has his first weapon, he collects laser charges from all over the surgical ward, kills the necromorph strapped to a gurney and moves on.]

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Isaac. It’s Daina. You have to dismember the Creatures to stop them.

Isaac Clarke: I know. I’ve had a lot of practice.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Just try to stay in one piece.

Isaac Clarke: Thanks.

[Some time later, Isaac finds a dead soldier. His radio still works.]

Soldier 1: Did you see that? I shot off his fucking legs and he’s still coming!

Soldier 2: Goddammit! I told you - take off all the limbs! That’s the only way they stay down for good!

[The radio is turned off. Walking a little further, Isaac meets an excited man. He beckons Isaac to follow him.]

Man: Isaac? Isaac! Come on, come on! They’re after US!

Isaac Clarke: Wait! WAIT! Who is? Who’s after us?

Computer: Warning: Security lockdown. The hospital bulkheads are closing. Please stand clear.

[Isaac can’t keep up with the man. The automatic doors close shut.]

Man: Isaac! Isaac! Through here! C’mon! Isaac! Awww, no, no… Isaac. Remember me… patient five. I’m patient five, remember? Do you remember? Agh…

Isaac Clarke: Daina, your fucking route didn’t work. There’s a security lockdown!

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) I told you to hurry! How did you miss it?

Isaac Clarke: Look, I don’t need your help.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Fine! Let’s see how long you last without it!

Isaac Clarke: Aw shit.

[A bunch of necromorphs enter. Isaac has to deal with them.]

Isaac Clarke: Daina? Daina! Okay, you’re right. I do need your help. Talk to me.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Look, Isaac, we don’t have to be friends. But like it or not, we’re stuck together. Tiedemann’s your enemy, not me. Alright, I’ve found you a new route.

Isaac Clarke: Fine. So where the hell am I? How did another necromorph outbreak get started?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) You’re on Titan Station, orbiting Saturn. As for the outbreak… shit, Tiedemann’s jamming my signal… (fades to static)

[Isaac enters the next room and, as usual, breaks the medical equipment and gets a stasis module, with which he kills the necromorph running at him. After that he enters the elevator. The lights go out for a second and Nicole’s ghost appears in the corner.]

Isaac Clarke: What the fuck?

Ghost of Nicole: How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky.

[She stares at him with her empty, glowing eyes and the lights return to normal. Isaac comes out of the elevator and sees several red balloons tied to the counter like it was someone’s birthday. He walks into the next room as the window breaks.]

Computer: Warning: Decompression

Isaac Clarke: Holy shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!

[He grabs a table and sharply pulls out his torch and fires at the shield activation panel. The window closes tightly.]

Computer: Hull breach rectified.

[Isaac goes further and finds the familiar electronic store from the first game. For only 1,000 cosmodollars, which was so conveniently lying on a table nearby, he buys his iconic engineering suit, which, to the developers’ credit, is from the end of the first game not from its beginning.]

Computer: Welcome to MicroStore: CEC Engineer Isaac Clarke. Updating inventory to CEC engineering load out.

[Having survived, Isaac emerges into the ruined part of the building, where the atmosphere is completely absent.]

Computer: Entering Vacuum.

Computer: Welcome to the Titan Station Emergency Care Wing. Due to the evacuation order, all services are currently suspended. All physicians and staff are ordered to report to their assigned evacuation craft immediately.

[Isaac approaches the destroyed space shuttle and a huge slug with long arms jumps out. It leaps powerfully after Isaac, knocking down the columns. Isaac deftly shoots at the slender knots of the monster’s arms and rips them off one by one. As the beast falls, Isaac slowly walks toward him. The monster makes one last attempt to kill him, but Isaac dodges.]

Isaac Clarke: Jeezus that thing was angry. Daina? I’m out of the hospital.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Okay, the tram station is just beyond the apartment blocks.

Isaac Clarke: Hang on. I need more answers. How long I have been here?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Three years. Tiedemann found you floating in space near Aegis VII and brought you here for study.

Isaac Clarke: Why can’t I remember anything?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) The Marker you found imprinted your brain with a self-replicating signal. The longer you’re awake, the more the signal spreads. It’s killing you Isaac. Tiedemann tried to keep it in check with memory suppressants.

Isaac Clarke: You said you could fix it, right?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Only if you reach me in time. Tram Station. Get moving.

Chapter 2
[Isaac walks out into the next room with an automatic track. After killing the necromorph athlete, he listens to a message from Tiedemann on the cracked monitors.]

Director Hans Tiedemann: (on monitors) Attention. This is Director Tiedemann. A station-wide emergency is in effect. In accordance with Titan Station Civic Code, I am declaring martial law. All citizens are ordered to evacuate. Looters will be shot on sight. This is not a drill. Move immediately to the nearest evac route.

[Isaac tries to save a guy in the elevator, but a necromorph drags him away.]

Poor Guy: Whoa, hey. Hey! Holy shit! Ah, FUCK!

Patient Five (Nolan Stross): Isaac! Isaac! Over here!

[Patient Five waves to Isaac from across the building.]

Isaac Clarke: Who are you?

Patient Five (Nolan Stross): It’s the drugs, Isaac. They gave us drugs to make us forget. But it’s all coming back…

Isaac Clarke: I don’t know what you’re talking about. Why are you calling me?!

Patient Five (Nolan Stross): Isaac! Isaac! Look out!

[A crawling necromorph attacks Isaac. He kills it and notices a man dragging a woman.]

Man: We CAN’T HELP HER!

Woman: No! I’m not leaving my mother!

Man: We have to go, NOW!

Woman: Noooooo! MOM!

[Isaac kills the necromorphs in the area and moves onto the laundry, with an eerie shaking washing machine. Suddenly the lights go off…]

Computer: Attention: Power grid failure. Grid rerouting, standby.

[A bunch of necromorphs attack Isaac and he stays alive only because of a line gun that he bought a couple minutes before.]

Computer: Power has been restored.

[Isaac walks past a row of apartments. From behind the door of one of them comes a concerned voice.]

Frightened Man: Don’t come any closer! You’re not getting in! I’m not opening this door for anyone, I don’t care what your security clearance is or what your orders are. I’m armed! I’ll fucking kill you if you try to get in! I mean it! Just stay away from my door!

[Isaac walks in the elevator.]

Isaac Clarke: There are necromorphs everywhere, is the entire Sprawl infected?! How did this happen? The Marker was destroyed, Daina. I destroyed it!

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) You destroyed A Marker, Isaac. Tiedemann built another one.

Isaac Clarke: On this station? Why?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) It’s powerful alien technology. Tiedemann wants that power. Get to the tram. It’ll take you to the Cassini Towers Tram Station. (fades to static)

Isaac Clarke: Daina? Dammit.

[Isaac continues walking toward the train. He sees a spaceship crash into a building…]

Isaac Clarke: Holy shit!

[…However, the glass withstands the impact. Isaac walks past a row of billboards. The image on them changes and the quiet voice of Nicole’s ghost comes from somewhere.]

Ghost of Nicole: Isaac? Are you there? I’m so cold. The needle is burning in my arm. Isaac? Where are you? The room is getting dark. I can’t see you. Isaac?

[Isaac goes out to the station. Nicole’s ghost sits quietly on the bench. The world around her seems to be slowly sinking into hell. A burning train rumbles along the tracks. A moment later, everything is back to normal.]

Computer: Attention: All transportation to and from Government Sector has been cancelled. All transports along Public Sector loops A and B are reporting delays of 1 hour or more. Gamma station is reporting closed.

[Isaac boards the train, killing the necromorphs who are inside. He hacks into the control panel and lets the train go. The train rushes forward at breakneck speed. Isaac runs to the opposite side of the train. Soon it turns out that there are not enough cars and he has to fly a short distance between the cars.]

Computer: Now approaching: Cassini Towers Tram Station. Please remain seated while the tram is in motion.

[The train crashes when it arrives at the station. Isaac hangs his head upside down, caught in the wires. He is attacked by a horde of necromorphs and has to defend himself to the last bullet, and when they run out, he throws the train wreckage lying on the ground. It is only through fortitude and willpower that Isaac manages to survive this hopeless situation.]

Chapter 3
Isaac Clarke: Daina, I need a new route.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) What happened? I thought we lost you!

Isaac Clarke: Unscheduled stop. Where am I?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) How did you end up there? Hang on. This won’t be the most pleasant route, but it’ll get you to the Cassini Towers residential sector. Dammit! Tiedemann has your signal again. Keep moving!

Isaac Clarke: Okay.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) You’re very important to them, Isaac… Hold tight, I’ll contact you soon!

[Isaac goes further, killing a crowd of necromorphs that ironically look like children near the children’s playroom. After that, Patient Five calls him again.]

Patient Five (Nolan Stross): Isaac! Isaac! You still alive? We can’t talk long. I think they’re tracking our signals! Are the memories coming back to you? They’re coming back to me… the good ones… Ow! The-the bad ones… The more I remember, the more my head hurts. I keep seeing the symbols… Do you see the symbols too, Isaac? And him… I keep seeing his face… Ah shit… they’ve found me.

Isaac Clarke: Hey Daina, there’s this crazy guy that keeps contacting me. I saw him back at the hospital.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Nolan Stross. He was a patient in the project just like you.

Isaac Clarke: Yeah? Why was he there? What does he want?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) He’s a psychopath Isaac, stay clear of him. He murdered his own wife and child.

Isaac Clarke: Okay, I’ll be careful.

[He walks into a Unitology recruitment center, which is located in a shopping district of the station.]

Isaac Clarke: Daina. I thought you were routing me to residential. This looks like… a Unitology recruitment center? Am I still on track?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Yes. There’s an old maintenance access point in there that will take you through the waste disposal system and into the Cassini Towers. Stay sharp.

[Isaac takes the elevator up to the fall of the recruitment center. From the speakers comes an advertising message explaining the essence of the doctrine.]

Loudspeaker: Have you ever felt like you were meant to be part of something bigger? Then maybe Unitology is for you. Founded two hundred years ago by our Savior, Michael Altman, Unitologists believe that one day all mankind will be united through the power of a sacred artifact known as the Marker. We call this process Convergence. Imagine it. All mankind, brought together with one purpose. With one mind. With one soul. No war. No fear. No hate. If that sounds like an ideal world to you, then look no further. Convergence is coming. And Unitology… Is helping it happen.

[Isaac descends into the depths of the recruitment center and finds the body of a guard with the corpses of necromorphs hanging next to it. The guard has left a helpful video for the survivors on how to kill the necromorphs.]

Guard: (panting) Okay. Whoever sees this, listen up. You can use kinesis to pull blades off dead ones, and shoot it back at them. Watch, watch. I stayed alive three hours using this trick. You see? Just shoot it back at them. Uh, I’m going to bleed out soon. I got clipped pretty bad earlier. So I hope this helps you out, whoever you are.

[Isaac goes into the garbage disposal control room or something like that. He pushes a few buttons.]

Computer: Diagnostic mode initiated for Waste Compression Chamber 752. Compressor piston offline. It is now safe to enter the chamber. Authorized personnel only.

[Isaac enters the shaft and blows the garbage out.]

Computer: Entering Zero-Gravity.

[Next he needs to fix an elevator. Fortunately the battery lies nearby.]

Computer: Power malfunction. Please replace the power unit to use the elevator.

[Isaac goes out to the residential area. In one of the rooms, which looks like a nursery, he has a seizure. The world spins before his eyes in a hellish merry-go-round. Isaac sees the ghost of Nicole sitting on the bed. A white glow emanates from her mouth and eyes.]

Ghost of Nicole: I’m afraid, Isaac. I don’t want to die. But it’s the only way out.

Isaac Clarke: You’re not Nicole! Nicole is dead! You’re not really here.

[The ghost disappears. Isaac goes out on the balcony.]

Isaac Clarke: Daina! Tiedemann’s soldiers have found me! They’re tracking me in some sort of gunship!

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) You’re almost here! Hurry.

[Isaac enters a dark hall decorated with a large statue of Marker. Out of the darkness, he is attacked by several brutal necromorphs, who nearly kill him. Wobbling from his wounds, Isaac walks toward the Church of Unitology. In the great hall in front of the entrance, he manages to hear about the history of the church.]

Stand 1 (Divine Discovery): In 2214, a geophysicist named Michael Altman made a discovery that would change history. Buried at the impact site of a crater near the Yucatan peninsula, he uncovered a divine alien presence - the Marker. The Marker spoke to Altman and revealed a plan that would unify mankind and lead them to a bright new future.

Stand 2 (Prophet and Martyr): By the millions, people flocked to hear more about the Marker and the unity it promised after Michael Altman told the world of his profound discovery. But there were those who felt threatened by Altman’s message. On March 15th 2215, Altman was assassinated and thus became the first Martyr for the church.

Stand 3 (Founding of the Church): Altman’s followers mourned his death but found divine solace in his message of unity. They would not allow the truth to be silenced and formed the Church of Unitology to bring his teachings to the world.

Stand 4 (Billions Strong): Today the Church of Unitology can be found everywhere in the known Universe. Its message is just as strong and relevant today as it was when Altman first revealed it. Billions of believers can be found across all social, economic and cultural groups and more are joining every day.

Stand 5 (Bringing Light to Titan): Growing from a small group of devout miners on Titan, the Titan Station Church of Unitology has flourished into a hub of Unitology worship, practice and learning. It boasts one of the largest and most beautiful churches in the Sol system and is often the site of the annual Unitology Enigma Symposium.

Stand 6 (Looking for the Future): As we awalt glorious Convergence, it is important to continue to nurture our relationship with the Marker and understand the future, it is preparing for us. The Marker calls to all of us. It is our duty to approach it with an open heart and open mind.

[In the courtyard in front of the church, a ship following Isaac starts shooting into the station trying to kill him.]

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) It’s Tiedemann! He’s found you! Into the Church, hurry!

[Isaac runs to the Church.]

Chapter 4
Isaac Clarke: Daina? The Church of Unitology? Why here?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) It’s one of the few places on Titan Station that Tiedemann can’t monitor. Separation of Church and State.

Isaac Clarke: No Daina, we shouldn’t be in here. This is the last place we want to be right now.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Isaac, my brother died trying to rescue you. This is important. This will work. I’m in a safe room at the top of the Church. Meet me there, okay?

[Reluctantly Isaac continues to explore the church. He walks slowly through the stately halls with expensive decorations and looks at the various informational materials.]

Stand (recorded voice): Welcome to the Church of Unitology gift shop! Find that special souvenir for that special someone to let them know you stood in the shrine of Altman today! Marker pendants made from the fragments of Titan itself are now available! Altman be Praised.

Stand (recorded voice): Beyond these doors lies the Reading Room, a place where believers are encouraged to relax and meditate on the teachings of the Church: The shelves are lined with select inspirational materials as well as a variety of meditation aids. Please respect the sanctity of this space and those using it by remaining quiet and reverent while inside.

[Suddenly Stross video links Isaac.]

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Isaac? Isaac. I know you see the symbols too. They mean something!

Isaac Clarke: Stross. Yes I see the symbols.

Nolan Stross: (via radio) We’re a threat to them, I know it. We have to work together! …Oh, my nose is bleeding? When did that start? Uhhh.

Isaac Clarke: Work together? Who’s them? You mean Tiedemann? Stross? Work with me Stross!

[However, he just goes out of frame and disconnects.]

Stand (recorded voice): Welcome to the Titan Station Church of Unitology! We’re glad you’ve come to visit our sanctuary, and place of light and hope. Our tour guides are looking forward to showing you the best of our beliefs, and what a meaningful and enlightening impact we can have in your daily life. There is of course no obligation of any kind with this tour. Kindly remember to stay with your tour guide at all times. Someone will be with you shortly.

Stand (recorded voice): Welcome to the Unity Hail. This magnificent library holds copies of the Church’s most sacred texts and is a regular meeting place for the Unitology scholars as they debate the glorious mysteries of the Black Marker. Note the intricate details of the stained glass roof, forged from the hand-filtered sand of Titan itself!

[Isaac descends the spiral staircase into the library, which has an elevator in the center. Suddenly he is attacked from all sides and forced to defend himself until the doors open. After winning, he rides the elevator.]

Stand (recorded voice): Welcome to Indoctrination. A church seminar is currently in progress. Please wait for the next available church associate. Indoctrination is a pleasant, joyous event, uhere you will take the first step into glorious oneness that is… Unitology.

[Isaac enters the indoctrination room. On the left and right are chairs with brainwashing monitors. An obtrusive commercial for the church is on TV.

TV: Have you ever felt like you were meant to be part of something bigger? Then maybe Unitology is for you. Founded two hundred years ago by our Savior, Michael Altman, Unitologists believe that one day all mankind will be united through the power of a sacred artifact known as the Marker. We call this process Convergence. Imagine it. All mankind, brought together with one purpose. With one mind. With one soul. No war. No fear. No hate. If that sounds like an ideal world to you, then look no further. Convergence is coming. And Unitology… Is helping it happen.

[Isaac goes into the right room and starts taking panels to reroute power to the door.]

Computer: Please replace the fuse for the Observation Center door in the junction panel. Vandalism in the Church is not permitted.

[In the far security room, Isaac has a seizure and begins to see Nicole’s eye on the monitors.]

Ghost of Nicole: I’m so cold, Isaac. It hurts. Where are you going? You can’t run from the pain forever. Soon you’ll beg for a way to end it all.

[In the back of the guard room, Isaac picks up the schematics for the new suit and climbs out into the tech tunnel. When he climbs out he is attacked by Nicole’s ghost with a syringe in his hand. She aims it at Isaac’s right eye and makes a creepy high-pitched sound.]

Ghost of Nicole: MAKE US WHOLE!

[The seizure ends and Isaac realizes that he was fighting himself - the syringe was in his hand. Without realizing what had happened, he goes on and takes the elevator down to the basement of the church. When he arrives at the door out, it breaks unexpectedly, as if someone hit it from the other side.]

Isaac Clarke: Daina I’m locked out. There’s something in the church. It broke the door!

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Hang on. I’ll try to override all the gates in the area.

Isaac Clarke: Hurry. There’s something out here, too…

[Isaac is attacked by necromorphs, which resemble a mixture of bird and human. They hide around corners and run out sharply, knocking him down. Isaac picks up an iron bar with kinesis and throws it at the fleeing monsters.]

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Isaac, I don’t think I can… Not now!

[Isaac kills all the necromorphs in the area.]

Isaac Clarke: Daina, you there?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Isaac, I can’t unlock the elevator! Can you do anything from your end?

Isaac Clarke: Let me see what I can do.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Okay, once you’re through you’ll go through the Funerary wing of the church and down into the crypt. It’s very important you’re not…

[The communication breaks.]

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) No! No, Earth Gov can’t jam us in here! Not in here.

Isaac Clarke: Daina? Daina? Important that I what?

[However, she does not answer. Isaac has to look for a way out on his own.]

Stand (recorded voice): Welcome to the basilical This hauntingly beautiful hail serves as the starting point for many of our formal ceremonies. Its architecture is rich in symbolism. and the stained glass ceilings are forged from no less than the sands of Jupiter’s long lost moon, Io, making them nearly priceless. Enjoy the light and the love this room offers, as many have done before you.

Stand (recorded voice): Attention: Please be quiet when observing the funerary rituals of the church. Flash photography and holographic imaging are not permitted inside the Church. Thank you for your compliance.

[Isaac walks in a chapel.]

Recorded sermon: Children of the Marker, we gather now to pay respect to the bodies of the dead those who have been fortunate to be called ahead of us. Their bodies and souls go now into protective custody of the Church where they will be looked after and cared for. This is not an occasion for grief, but an occasion to rejoice. Let us always remember that death is a blessing just as all life comes from the Marker, all life will one day return to it. The body and soul will live on, with brothers and sisters, with family and friends, when the day of Convergence arrives. For this is what the Marker promises us and this is what we know to be true. Altman be praised.

[Behind the altar, Isaac finds an elevator that takes him down to the sect’s secret research laboratory, which looks like a large refrigerator.]

Chapter 5
[Isaac dives into the secret lab. In his seizures he sees people tortured and screaming in agony in flasks along the walls of the laboratory. Soon he emerges from the refrigerator and finds himself in front of a huge machine that creates artificial gravity. Isaac tries to contact Daina.]

Isaac Clarke: Daina? I think I’ve found the exit but it’s way above me. Gravity controls are locked out. Daina? …Fuck!

[The communication is very bad, probably because of the running machine. Isaac takes the elevator down to the bottom of it.]

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) I don’t know if you can hear me… You need… to go… up. Do you hear me? You need to go up.

[Isaac hacks into the mechanism and stops it.]

Computer: Attention: Crypt systems set to diagnostic mode. Gimble capture arms released. Authorized technicians only.

[Isaac lowers the grips to the spinning mechanism.]

Computer: Gravity in the shunt is now offline.

[Having turned off gravity, Isaac flies to the top of the mechanism and starts it up again through the control panel.]

Computer: Exiting Zero-Gravity

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) Isaac? Dammit! I think they relamming our signal with a mobile device. Someone get me the frequency on that jammer. They must have a gunship positioned near the compound!

Isaac Clarke: Now what? Change of plans?

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) No. If they knew where we were they’d have killed us by now. Shit! Signal’s fading! Just follow your locator and hurry!

[Isaac walks through the dark corridors of the church and eventually emerges into an enormous room resembling churches of the past. There he is attacked by a giant stick-like necromorph. It tries to pierce him with its stinger, but Isaac shoots the ulcer at the base of the stinger and the monster decides not to play with such dangerous prey. It runs away and Isaac is attacked by little necromorphs that look like 12-year-old children. He retreats deep into the building and stands in the hallway to keep them out and kills them one by one. He makes his way through the throngs of bloodthirsty necromorphs to the second floor, where he finds a copy of The Marker. He has a seizure.]

Ghost of Nicole: What’s happening to you, Isaac? You tried to kill yourself. Why do you think that is? That’s right. Ignore the pain. Bury it deep inside. Let me fester - let me rot.

[After Isaac comes to his senses, he takes the elevator.]

Isaac Clarke: Daina you still with me? I’ve reached the top of the church.

Daina Le Guin: (via radio) You’re almost here! I’ll be waiting by the shuttle.

[He walks toward the shuttle, and then… two of Daina’s assistants grab him. She herself is facing the window.]

Isaac Clarke: Daina?! You’re a Unitologist? Of course you are. Why did I trust you?

Daina Le Guin: Well. You didn’t have a choice, Isaac. I told you there was a cure, and you came running.

Isaac Clarke: Why are you doing this? Why can’t everyone leave me alone?

Daina Le Guin: You’re a dangerous secret, Isaac. Earth Gov won’t leave you alone because they’re afraid you’ll destroy their Marker. After all, you did build it.

Isaac Clarke: What are you talking about?

Daina Le Guin: Well, that’s why we brought you here. To build Markers for us. To spread glorious Convergence to the entire galaxy.

Isaac Clarke: You people are unbelievable. Just give me the fucking cure and let me go.

Daina Le Guin: Oh we don’t want to cure you, Isaac! We need that precious little head of yours just the way it is. Now would you escort Isaac to the shuttle and put him in stasis. The last thing we want is for him to die.

[Suddenly the room is attacked - a ship opens fire. Daina instantly dies, as does one of those holding Isaac. Isaac puts on his helmet and throws the other away. The room is depressurized and Isaac has to fight for his life as he is pulled into space. He manages to grab the hatch cover on the floor, open it and climb inside. He falls to the blood-stained floor. He is immediately attacked by a necromorph stickman, who furiously chases after Isaac, breaking everything around him. Isaac doesn’t give up and shoots at the monster’s limbs at every opportunity and eventually forces the creature to flee. It is still alive, however, and, changing tactics, begins to run after Isaac down a long corridor, at the end of which they are both met by the same ship that killed Daina. The room is depressurized again and Isaac and the necromorph fly out into space, where they continue to fight. They cling to the hull of a piece of the ship, from which several fuel cylinders fly out. Isaac shoots at them, finally killing the pesky thing. The explosion throws him off and he lands on the station, in the living quarters of the church.]

Chapter 6
[Isaac got a video link from Nolan.]

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Isaac? Isaac, are you there? Can you hear me?

Isaac Clarke: What do you want, Stross? Look. It’s over. All my plans just blew out the window.

Nolan Stross: (via radio) No, no, no, no! It’s not over. At least, not yet. Isaac… Isaac, we built it. We can tear it down!

Isaac Clarke: You mean the Marker? Do you know where the Marker is Stross?

Nolan Stross: (via radio) I… It’s in the Government Sector! The Government Sector! But we have to move now! Now! Now! Now! Because time is running out for me… for us.

Isaac Clarke: Stross. Stross! Where are you going? Shit!

[Isaac has no choice but to continue his journey. He walks through creepy living quarters where horrible things have happened - necromorphs infiltrated the place and killed unsuspecting residents. The corridors are quite dark, with only a handful of candles on the floor to light the way.]

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Isaac! They were afraid of us after the sessions. I remember! They took us to the machine. For our sessions. For the steps!

Isaac Clarke: I don’t remember any sessions.

Nolan Stross: (via radio) You’re lucky you don’t remember. When you do, he starts coming back.

Isaac Clarke: Who? Who comes back? Who?!

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Oh, look at you! You’ve grown up so much! Where are you going?

Isaac Clarke: Stross, don’t follow him! He’s not really there!

[However, Nolan does not listen to Isaac and disconnects. Isaac finds a video on some poor guy’s body.]

Tiedemann: (on video) This is Director Tiedemann. All surviving squads are ordered to fall back. Repeat. Fall back to Government Sector. Operation: Endgame is in effect. Contingencies are in place to deal with our lost assets.

[Isaac continues to explore the dark floors, battling extremely aggressive necromorphs lurking literally around every corner. He even manages to survive a skirmish in the great hallway, where he is attacked from all sides and has almost no ammunition to spare.]

Computer: Entering Zero-Gravity

Computer: Warning: Fire suppression system malfunction Please manually deplete the oxygen supply to contain the fire. Non-essential personnel should leave the area at once.

Computer: Attention: Oxygen output falling to 66%. A service technician has been notified.

Computer: Warning: Oxygen output falling to 33%. This area is now below lite support minimums. Please verify your personal oxygen supplies.

Computer: Life support failure: Oxygen output is zero. This area is unsafe for habitation. Personal oxygen supplies are now required.

[After Isaac turns off all three oxygen generators, the burning in the corridor stops. He moves on and finds an elevator with a dead battery. After replacing the battery, Isaac opens the elevator with a creepy zombie sitting inside. After a brief struggle Isaac defeats him and breaks his head with the handle of his plasma cutter. After he enters the elevator, he is contacted again by the mentally ill Stross.]

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Isaac, the steps. He wants me to follow the steps. Step one, crawl into the dark machine.

Isaac Clarke: Stross, calm down! He can’t hurt you!

Nolan Stross: (via radio) He wants me to go into the dark machine, Isaac. I can’t go. She’s in there. She’s waiting for me.

Isaac Clarke: Stross…

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Oh God… Oh God, oh God…

Isaac Clarke: Stross! Listen to me! You need to keep moving. Can you get to the train? Can you do that?

Stross: (via radio) He’s coming. Can’t talk…

[He quickly disconnects. Isaac takes the elevator and finds himself in a small room. All the doors are closed, but one of them has a broken electric lock. Quickly destroying it, Isaac finds himself in a vast warehouse with many standing metal boxes that form a maze. However, this labyrinth is not empty. It is inhabited by a new special species of necromorphs, resembling birds crossed with humans. They do not attack Isaac immediately, but hide and wait. They attack at the right moment with a wild screech, but Isaac is ready for the fight. Thanks to newly found blueprints, he has assembled a mortar and placed mines in advance, expecting trouble. No one is killed rather quickly by the mines. Isaac makes his way to the far side of the warehouse and breaks the control panel to open the far door. When he gets inside he is contacted again by Stross.]

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Isaac?! He’s gone. Listen, the steps can destroy the Marker. Step 1. Crawl into the dark machine. Step 2. The screws go tight, all around…

Isaac Clarke: I don’t understand.

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Oh God, he’s back! NO! No no no no no!

[The connection is abruptly cut off again. Isaac continues up the blood-stained staircase - which appears to have been dragged by bodies - and enters the vast upper level, where he spots a woman furiously fighting several necromorphs attacking her. In her hands we see a plasma cutter.]

Woman: Yeah, come on I dare ya! Come on! Yeah, come on! You like this! Come and get it! Yeah, you like that, huh? You like it! Well, come and get it! Come on! Come on you motherfuckers! I’m still standing! Come on! Come and get it! This is the last stand! Piece of shit, come on… You wanna piece of me, huh? What? What? I’m still here, huh, come on!

[Isaac runs to her aid, killing several necromorphs in the process. When he reaches the bridge, which can be crossed to the woman, she shoots him with a warning shot.]

Isaac Clarke: Hey! Hey!

Woman: You stay back. You wanna talk, you talk from there.

[She uses a video link so she doesn’t have to shout from the far corner of the room.]

Woman: (via radio) And don’t say you’re here to help. The last person who said that tried to kill me.

Isaac Clarke: Take it easy. I’m not going to hurt you…

Woman: (via radio) Yeah, you got that right. You try it and you’re dead.

[She turns off the video link and begins repair of the door control panel, closing the thick blinds in the process. Isaac comes closer and removes his helmet.]

Isaac Clarke: Look. I think we got off to a bad start here. I’m Isaac.

Woman: Ellie. What do you want, Isaac?

Isaac Clarke: I’m trying to get to the Transport Hub. I need to get to the Government Sector.

Ellie: What do you think we were trying to do?

Isaac Clarke: Hey, I can help you. Besides, we got a better chance if we stick together. Don’t you agree?

Ellie: Not a chance, Isaac. Other people are just a liability. I’ll release the door lock, but after that you’re on your own. And please, DON’T follow me. OK?

Isaac Clarke: Wait… Wait!

[She finishes repairing the elevator door and goes inside while lifting the thick blinds. Isaac takes the elevator and after wandering the corridors for a while finds a kind of kindergarten. The room, decorated with various toys and done in bright and light colors, creates a sense of carefree fun, but the slight mess and puddles of blood on the floor tell Isaac not to put down his weapon. He walks past the enclosed room that a woman sits in and beckons a tiny necromorph child with a huge pus boil on his back.]

Woman: Come to momma! Yes, yes that’s it. Come to momma. Oh, right up here. Oh, oh! Yes, there you go.

[She embraces the creepy creature and they explode together, spilling blood and guts all over the room. Isaac looks on in horror and disgust.]

Loudspeaker: (prerecorded) Okay everyone, 15 minutes for recess! Play nice!

[Isaac moves on, and now he has to face the creepy exploding children himself.]

Loudspeaker: (prerecorded) Remember, colds and flu spread fast in space. Be sure your children’s vaccinations are always up to date. See a nurse today!

[When Isaac leaves the nurse’s office, he has another seizure. The locker doors begin to open and close spontaneously. The seizure itself, however, passes very quickly. Isaac goes on and enters a kind of gymnasium that can be reconstructed into a performance space. Here Isaac has to fight with the older children. They surround him with a large crowd and prevent him from using his weapon. After struggling to fight them off, he walks on. He hears the school bell.]

Loudspeaker: (prerecorded) Recess is over!

[A little farther away in the next room he finds blueprints for a flamethrower. A very interesting place for such an object! When Isaac leaves the kindergarten, he has a seizure again. He sees his dead girlfriend standing by the merry-go-round pushing it. Out of her mouth and eyes comes the usual bright blue glow. She speaks to Isaac as if through a walkie-talkie.]

Ghost of Nicole: Still in denial? Afraid you’re going to cut your wrists if you listen to me?

Isaac Clarke: I’m not listening to this. You may foal Strass, but I know you’re not real.

Ghost of Nicole: Oh, you claim I’m not real, and yet here I am.

Isaac Clarke: You’re just a hallucination! Stross knows how to destroy you! He knows how to destroy the Marker. We will destroy you!

Ghost of Nicole: How convenient. Destroy the Marker and all the hurt and pain go away. Imagine it, Isaac: You’ll never have to listen to your heart.

[Isaac enters the elevator. As he makes his way upstairs, Ellie calls him on the video link. She has her plasma cutter in the crosshairs of some poor guy who is shaking with fear.]

Ellie: Isaac. It’s Ellie. I’ve found someone. Another survivor. He says he knows you. 

Nolan Stross: Isaac…

Ellie: I said stand stand still.

Isaac Clarke: Ellie! Take it easy! His name is Stross. I know him.

Ellie: He looks… twitchy. I don’t trust him. Don’t move!

Isaac Clarke: Ellie! I need him to be - not dead. I need him.

Ellie: Shit. Ok, Isaac. I’ll march him to the hub but if he does anything stupid, ANYTHING, I will shoot him.

[After taking the elevator, Isaac exits and walks down several corridors into a vast area. On the second floor he sees Ellie and Nolan.]

Ellie: Isaac! We’re up here. Come on, move!

Nolan Stross: Hello, Isaac.

Ellie: Well, this brings up bad memories. I barely managed to escape this CEC Facility this morning.

Isaac Clarke: Wait, you’re CEC?

Ellie: Heavy equipment pilot, class Four. You?

Isaac Clarke: Engineer.

Ellie: Nerd. Figures.

[The station shakes a little and the lights go out.]

Ellie: Shit.

Nolan Stross: It’s dark - he’ll find me in the dark!

Ellie: Shut up! It’s ok, it’s just a power outage.

Isaac Clarke: You guys alright up there?

Ellie: Shit, I think life support is out too. That’s not good.

[Isaac’s video link comes on. On the holographic screen we see the station master himself, Tiedemann. He can be easily recognized because Isaac saw his picture just a few minutes before he came out to Ellie - it was posted on a propaganda poster.]

Tiedemann: Our two remaining runners, Clarke and Stross. I knew it was only a matter of time before you reached the transit hub. You will find the train inoperable.

Isaac Clarke: Are you insane? You cut off power to life support! There may be other survivors over here!

Tiedemann: The public sector is already beyond acceptable recovery conditions. And I can’t allow you to escape. Good-bye, Clarke.

[The room is filled with necromorphs. Ellie has to fight them off and protect Nolan. She notices a large necromorph about to jump to the first floor.]

Ellie: Holy shit, Isaac, look out! It’s headed for YOU! They’re coming from both sides! They’re everywhere! Get behind me! Here they came! Stross, look out! There’s too many! I can’t hold them back!

[Unable to fight such a massive monster, Isaac runs around the room and places mines. Unable to dodge them because of his large size and clumsiness, the necromorph crashes into them and after a few such explosions dies.]

Ellie: Isaac, are you alright? I think that’s all of them, for now… Why did Tiedemann turn off power? What did you do to piss him off so much?

Isaac Clarke: Ellie… Do you know what a marker is?

Ellie: Yeah, the Unitologists on my crew wouldn’t shut up about it. Why? Is it real?

Isaac Clarke: Yes it’s real. Tiedemann made one using codes, patterns stored in our heads… mine and Stross. Everything that’s happening on this station is happening because of that Marker. I have to get to it and destroy it and I need Stross to tell me how.

Ellie: You’re a strange man, Isaac.

Isaac Clarke: Will you help me?

Ellie: We’re about to suffocate. So, I think I’d better.

Isaac Clarke: Ok good, listen we need power. Without it we have no air and no train. The Sprawl’s gotta have back-up batteries somewhere.

Ellie: Yes, the solar arrays up there! But they’ve been mothballed for years.

Isaac Clarke: Ok… alright, good. I’m heading there now. If I can start them up and get some power to the train.

Ellie: You’ll need someone to open the collector panels. I can do that.

Isaac Clarke: Take Stross. Keep him safe.

[Isaac moves on. He gathers all the ammunition he can and kills the creepy necromorph stuck to the wall. The man the creature grew out of is still moaning in pain. The necromorph spits little tentacled necromorphs out of its body. After destroying the creature, Isaac gains access to the elevator.]

Chapter 7
[Isaac calls Ellie as he rides the elevator.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie. How’s Stross doing?

Ellie: (via radio) Shhhh!… Shut the power off, you can hear noises three blocks away. He’s going to give away my position.

Isaac Clarke: Ellie, try to keep him focused. I need to know what he’s trying to tell me.

[He exits the elevator and examines the massive building block, trying to figure out how the solar panels can be activated here.]

Computer: The Docking Pod is off the mag-rail. An Engineering work order has been issued.

Isaac Clarke: Ellie. I ran into a snag. It looks like the Docking Pod that runs to the Solar Array is floating at the bottom of the shaft.

Ellie: (via radio) That figures.

Isaac Clarke: Don’t worry, I can fix this. I’m heading outside to have a look.

[Isaac has to work in zero gravity again. He notices that there are cylinders attached to various pieces of debris hanging freely in space, a shot which throws the debris off. He clears the way for the elevator and then lifts the elevator itself by shooting two canisters underneath it.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie. I’ve got the elevator repaired. I’m heading up to the array. How’s Stross doing?

Ellie: (via radio) How do you think he’s doing? Can you hear this shit?

Isaac Clarke: He’s hallucinating, Ellie. It’s part of the sickness.

Ellie: (via radio) This is going to be trouble.

Isaac Clarke: It already is. Just keep moving.

[Isaac returns to the entrance of the elevator where a necromorph already waits for him. The fight in the cramped room with the nimble opponent is not the easiest, but Isaac still wins. He enters the elevator and goes up. The elevator leaves within the confines of the station and Isaac gets a chance to observe the stunning view of Saturn right out the elevator window. However, the idyll does not last long. Soon two large necromorphs jump onto the elevator and break the windows. The oxygen is rapidly depleted and Isaac has to fight with only a few minutes to spare.]

Computer: Arriving at… Solar Array Sigma zero five.

[Isaac is relieved to leave the elevator and breathes in the air. As he enters the next room he encounters a hologram.]

Computer: Welcome to Solar Array Sigma-Zero-Five. Proper identification is required. Please wait here. Watchman… Howard Phillips will be with you shortly. 

[Isaac searches the room and finds a small room decorated in earthly style. On the bed lies a corpse… it appears to be Howard Phillips himself. Isaac is about to leave the room and move on. He walks to the door, but the computer suddenly won’t let him in.]

Computer: Your RIG is not authorized to access this area. Please step away from the door.

[Using kinesis, Isaac brings Howard Phillips’ corpse to the scanner.]

Computer: RIG authorization recognized. Greetings, Station watchman Howard Phillips. I hope you slept well.

[As Isaac passes on, the computer activates an exploding holographic fence.]

Computer: Unauthorized visitor detected. Auto-defenses activated Station watchman Howard Phillips, please provide verbal access code to authorize your guest.

[Unable to resurrect the already dead Phillips, Isaac throws a piece of garbage into the fence to detonate it. In the next room, the situation becomes much more serious.]

Computer: Activating anti-personnel system.

[The exploding fence is positioned between the hatch leading to outer space, and the exploding children begin to get close to the fence. Isaac tries to kill them as quickly as possible, but fails. The exploding fence kicks the hatch open to space. Isaac is pulled in, but at the last second he manages to shoot the button and close the escape hatch. After destroying the remaining necromorphs, he enters Phillips’ office and hacks into the elevator control panel.]

Computer: Attention Watchman Howard Phillips. Unauthorized engagement of access lift detected. Please respond.

[Isaac goes up to the top floor and lowers the bridge with kinesis.]

Tiedemann: (via radio) Clarke, I know you’re up there. Understand that even if you survive long enough to restore power, there is no escape. All routes in and out of government sector are being monitored. Give up, Clarke.

[In the next corridor, the computer throws up a new challenge.]

Computer: Purging Life Support.

[The air is pumped out of the corridor and Isaac is attacked by necromorphs. Fighting them off, he hacks into a panel and restores the oxygen supply.]

Computer: Unauthorized Visitor, mainframe.

Tiedemann: (via loudspeaker) Computer, this is Director Tiedemann. Disable all Solar Array functions immediately.

Computer: Initiating System Lockdown. System Lockdown Complete.

Tiedemann: (via loudspeaker) I’m sorry Clarke. I know what you are trying to do, and I cannot allow you to succeed. There is too much at stake.

[Isaac uses the technical tunnel to bypass the door security and takes the keys out of the mainframe. Inserting them in a certain order, he raises the access panel.]

Computer: Unauthorized access to the computer mainframe is a violation of Titan Station Civic Code. Replace all panels and back away from the fuseboard.

Computer: Warning. Mainframe electric shielding has been deactivated. Proceed with caution.

Computer: Warning. You are now in violation of multiple subsections of the Titan Station Civic Code. Stand clear of all machinery immediately.

Computer: Mainframe containment compromised. Security has been notified.

Computer: Mainframe circuits are extremely fragile. Please step away. Damaging the mainframe circuits will cause lapses in programming. For your safety, step away from the circuits.

[Isaac defeats the guards - several necromorphs - and makes his way to the mainframe. After destroying several power circuits, he shuts it down. The computer begins to speak in a voice as if it is short of batteries.]

Computer: Automated functions - off-line. Station reverting to manual operation only… ANTI offline…

[Isaac walks into the next room where a corpse suddenly falls on top of him. Squeamishly, Isaac tosses it aside and calls Ellie.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie. I’m on my way to the mirrors now. I have to realign them manually. How’s Stross?

Ellie: (via radio) See for yourself…

Nolan Stross: (via radio) No, I’m not ready for the needle again! You have to let me out! I can’t breathe! Let me out!

Isaac Clarke: Stross, what’s wrong? Ellie?

Nolan Stross: (via radio) He’s… waiting… for… me!

[Isaac goes on and walks down a long transitional corridor where he has another seazure.]

Ghost of Nicole: How do you do it? How do you hold it all inside, your face never betraying your pain? No one would ever know the guilt you feel - never knew the dark thoughts you keep.

[Isaac goes into outer space.]

Computer: Entering Zero-Gravity.

Isaac Clarke: Ellie, it looks like two of the mirrors are out of alignment. How’s he doing?

Ellie: (via radio) He stopped hyperventilating but I don’t know how much longer he’s going to last. I knew he would just slow me down.

Isaac Clarke: If Stross dies, so do my chances of destroying the Marker. Keep him alive and get to that panel.

[It manually sets the direction for one solar panel.]

Isaac Clarke: Alright Ellie, one down. How’s it lookin’ on your end?

Ellie: (via radio) I’m trying to roll back the cover now. Stross, can you give me a hand with this?

Nolan Stross: (via radio) He’ll hurt me! I’m not strong enough!

Ellie: (via radio) I promise I’ll protect you, now just get over here and give me a hand. There’s something covering the collector panel. Oh my God, there’s hun-- there’s thousands of them. They’re breaking apart!

Isaac Clarke: Ellie, get out of there…

Ellie: (via radio) …oh God, they’re heading this way! Run, Stross, RUN!

Isaac Clarke: ELLIE! Ellie come in! Ellie! Shit.

[Isaac sets the second solar panel.]

Ellie: (via radio) Holy shit Isaac!

Isaac Clarke: Ellie? Elle, are you alright?!

Ellie: (via radio) We just made it into this crossover tube when the beam hit! Isaac, those things are still heading for the Transport Hub. They’re wrecking everything in their path!

Isaac Clarke: Oh shit, they’ll cut us off! Get to the hub - I’ll meet you as soon as I can!

[He returns to the station.]

Computer: Exiting Zero-Gravity.

Isaac Clarke: Ellie! Come in!

Ellie: (via radio) Isaac! We have to cross to the Government Sector before they cut us off! You’ll never make it down here in time!

Isaac Clarke: I’ll be there! I’ll be there!

Computer: Instability detected in the Array alignment. Emergency ejector systems initializing.

[Isaac sits in some sort of chair and launches himself into space at the speed of a cannonball. He flies as fast as he can, dodging various space debris. He flies into the building and lands on his feet like a superhero, breaking the slabs.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie! Where are you?

Ellie: (via radio) Right outside! Hurry! Isaac! This way! The train is this way. Oh shit. Move! Move! Move! Head for the factory! 

Isaac Clarke: Ellie, can you get the door to the factory open?

Ellie: (via radio) Are you crazy? I barely made it out of there with my life! That place is swarming with those things!

Isaac Clarke: No choice, go! Go!

[Isaac is attacked by many necromorphs on all sides. He tries to stay close to the door so that when it opens, he can walk right in. He uses a Ripper and chops up the necromorphs around him.]

Ellie: (via radio) Shit! Isaac. I’ll try to open the CEC door on your level. hold on! Piece of shit lock. I’m giving it my codes but it’s not working. Yes, I’m authorized for this! Open up you bastard! There! It’s open! Isaac go! Go Isaac! You can’t stop them all! Go!

[Isaac runs sharply inside and Ellie closes the doors behind him. The elevator begins to rise automatically. Isaac calls Ellie by video link. She is already on the verge of a nervous breakdown.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie? Are you guys there? Did you make it?

Ellie: Shit Isaac. Just… shit!

Isaac Clarke: Take it easy, it’s okay --

Ellie: No, it’s not! I was right here this morning with a crew of thirty people. But we were overrun, and before I knew it they were all transformed. I had to cut the arms and legs off my friends just to escape. I’m sure there’s pieces of them still lying around here somewhere.

Isaac Clarke: Ellie… I know. I’m sorry.

Ellie: And here I am again. I just walked one big fucking circle today.

Isaac Clarke: We’ll get through this. Let’s figure out how to meet up.

Ellie: Right. There’s a central Hub in the main facility. Here are the coordinates.

[The elevator stops and Isaac gets out.]

Chapter 8
[There seems to have been a bloody fight on this floor quite recently. There are dead bodies everywhere and blood on the walls. Isaac has a small seizure. Isaac enters a room that appears to be a security room. At the far end of the room there is a console with many monitors. Isaac has another seizure, and this time it is quite severe. He hears his dead girlfriend’s voice again.]

Ghost of Nicole: The cracks are showing, Isaac, and the memories are seeping in. And when they do. I’ll be waiting for you.

[Isaac enters the next room, all the doors of which are closed. Ellie and Stross are in the next room behind thick glass.]

Ellie: (via radio) Isaac, over here!! The door is jammed. This must have been the last stand for whoever was left down here.

Isaac Clarke: Can you get the door open on your end?

Ellie: (via radio) No the circuits are fried. They must have fused the panel trying to keep those things out.

Isaac Clarke: There has to be another way in.

Ellie: (via radio) The only way around is through the processing plant, but it’s not meant for human traffic. I think I can stop it from here though.

Isaac Clarke: Alright, do it.

Computer: Shut down accepted. Some systems may calibrate without notice,

Nolan Stross: (via radio) The steps. She wants me to follow the steps.

Isaac Clarke: Hold it together, Stross. I’ll be there soon.

[Isaac enters the next room filled with a variety of machines. They start spinning madly, scaring him. Several necromorphs attack him, but he quickly kills them by shooting their legs off. He goes to the next room, which is a tunnel.]

Computer: Entering Zero-Gravity

Isaac Clarke: I think I’ve hit a dead end. Looks like some kind of venting system up ahead.

Ellie: (via radio) Right… Manually shutting down the plant froze all the pressure valves in place. You’ll need to find a way to force it open.

[Isaac catches the gas cylinder with the kinesis and attaches it to the massive flap. As he shoots at the cylinder, he moves the flap and flies inside. As he flies up to the barrier of various tubular mechanisms they begin to rotate at tremendous speed. Isaac receives a video call from the station manager himself.]

Tiedemann: (via radio) Clarke, there you are. I see your friend has powered off the facility. Remind me to thank her for providing me with your location. I’ve locked the processing cycle on, and you in with it. It ends here, Clarke.

Isaac Clarke: It doesn’t have to be this way, Tiedemann!

Tiedemann: (via radio) It does, and it is. Goodbye, Clarke.

[He ends the video link. Isaac flies carefully past the meat grinders. Judging by the bodies floating around, he’s the only one who tried to do it, but he’s the only one who succeeded. Next he has to get past several powerful lasers. He uses the stasis module to suspend the moving mechanism and manage to get past the lasers. Next Isaac encounters rotating knives with very little room to get past them.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie, can’t you shut these things off?

Ellie: (via radio) No! Somehow Tiedemann declared me dead in the system, now my codes won’t work anymore!

Isaac Clarke: You’re kidding.

Ellie: (via radio) Oh Shit! Something’s coming! Stross! Help me with the door!

Nolan Stross: (via radio) I need you to see him. I need you to follow the steps!

Ellie: (via radio) What?! No! Just shut up and help me! God dammit! Rarrgh!!!

[Something is attacking her.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie? Ellie!

[Now Isaac will have to overcome all the challenges himself. He finds a way to bypass the rotating knives, and then he has to face the rings of fire, at the far end of which there is a giant necromorph that has merged with the hull of the ship. As he flies closer to it, Isaac fires several mines at it and it explodes. Flying on, he decides to call Ellie. It looks like she is fighting the necromorphs trying not to let them get close to Nolan.]

Isaac Clarke: Are you guys okay?

Ellie: (via radio) Not really!

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Step 3 Ellie.

Ellie: (via radio) Stross, through the door. Now!

Isaac Clarke: Hold them off. I think I’m close!

Computer: Exiting Zero-Gravity

[Isaac runs to the room where he left Ellie. When he goes inside, Ellie pulls a gun on him. All the necromorphs in the room are killed.]

Isaac Clarke: Hey! Hey!

Ellie: Oh God, Isaac! Glad to see you’ve got all your parts!

Isaac Clarke: You alright?

Ellie: Um, yeah.

Nolan Stross: There are four steps!

Ellie: …No thanks to twitchy here.

Nolan Stross: One, two, three, four. Step four. She’ll be waiting.

Isaac Clarke: Jesus, Stross. You okay?

Ellie: It’s getting worse.

Isaac Clarke: What is step four? Who will be waiting?

Nolan Stross: After the screws after the needle, she’ll be waiting.

Isaac Clarke: He’s not gonna make it. We gotta keep moving.

Ellie: There’s an Industrial Transport upstairs. Runs on the same spoke as the commuter train. It should get us to the government sector. One of us will have to deploy it from the gear house.

Isaac Clarke: Stay here and, uh, try to get him on his feet.

Chapter 9
[Isaac has to embark again on a dangerous journey. Out in the industrial part of the complex he fights several crawling necromorphs, attacking him almost immediately. He then rides the elevator and hears the voice of his dead girlfriend in his head.]

Ghost of Nicole: We only had two years Isaac. Two years, but they were the best years of my life. I was happy - I had everything I wanted. Until you made me doubt myself.

[After saving enough money and finding the blueprints, Isaac manages to upgrade his suit. A little extra armor never hurts in the face of such monsters, but in the next room he is surprised when he is attacked by one of the mutated scientists whose limbs have been lengthened. This new necromorph refuses to die and when Isaac kills him his limbs turn into spiders that crawl on the floor and attack Isaac as well. Having defeated the monster, Isaac enters the elevator. After climbing up and surviving the exploding necromorph he enters the next room whose corridors are protected by laser mines.]

Ghost of Nicole: Why would I choose the Ishimura over you? You said I’d regret passing up the chance that the choice would haunt me forever. It was as if you wanted me to leave.

[Isaac goes around further and kills a large necromorph merging with the wall.]

Ghost of Nicole: And when you received my final transmission. You couldn’t bear to watch the end, could you? You knew what had happened yet, you went looking for me anyway. You knew deep down all you would find was death.

[He enters the vehicle control room, but the bridge activation mechanism is broken.]

Isaac Clarke: Okay Ellie. I found the transport, but there’s a problem with the release mechanism.

Ellie: (via radio) No surprise there.

Isaac Clarke: Yeah. I’ll let you know when it’s fixed.

[Isaac disassembles the adjacent mechanism and fixes the bridge activation mechanism.]

Isaac Clarke: All right. I’ve released the Transport Meet me at the landing.

Ellie: (via radio) We’ll be right there. Stross, come on. Come ON!

[Isaac boards the train and removes his helmet. His dead girlfriend appears in front of him with glowing eyes and mouth.]

Ghost of Nicole: Why did you come looking for me if you knew I was dead, Isaac? Did you think I would forgive you?

Isaac Clarke: Get out of my head! You’re not Nicole!

Ghost of Nicole: (screams) Who am I, Isaac?

[After that, Nicole quickly disappears. Isaac’s transport reaches the station where Ellie and Nolan are waiting for him. Isaac opens the door for them.]

Ellie: Hey, you made it.

Nolan Stross: He’s staring at me, Isaac. Through the… holes… in his head.

Isaac Clarke: Stross, listen to me, listen to me!

Nolan Stross: Stop staring at me! Stop it!

Isaac Clarke: Relax! Relax!

Ellie: Isaac, we have to get out of here.

Isaac Clarke: Right. Let’s go.

[The train slowly begins to descend downward, giving us a view of the dock in which it is located. Isaac notices something familiar…]

Isaac Clarke: Oh my God! It can’t be - that’s the Ishimura…

Ellie: Yeah, used to be the pride of the CEC. Sad story, actually. I heard everybody onboard died - some sort of terrorist attack.

Isaac Clarke: What? Terrorist attack? What happened on board that ship was no terrorist attack.

Ellie: What do you mean?

Isaac Clarke: That’s where all this started, Ellie. Everything that’s happening here happened on that ship. I saw it. I was… onboard when it happ… happened.

[The train begins to shake violently.]

Isaac Clarke: Hey, what’s happening?

Ellie: …I don’t know. Something must be blocking the track.

Isaac Clarke: Stay here. I’ll take a look.

[He puts on his helmet and exits the train. The next room turns out to be a large warehouse filled with little necromorph bombs. After getting out of the death trap, Isaac discovers what caused the jam.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie! There’s a giant tentacle blocking the transport door. It’s wrapped around a big tank.

Ellie: (via radio) A big tank? Nitrogen Trichloride. Those explode if they overheat!

Isaac Clarke: Perfect!

[He picks up the gas cylinders lying on the floor and uses kinesis to throw them at the tank. Several of these gas cylinders explode it. The path is clear.]

Ellie: (via radio) That worked, we’re moving again. We’ll wait for you up ahead.

Isaac Clarke: Alright, I see you. I’ll meet you there.

[He takes a small elevator down to the circular arena. The elevator on the opposite side is blocked by a large tentacle.]

Isaac Clarke: Ok, Elle! Get ready, one more!

Ellie: (via radio) What?! Are you crazy? That one in the middle? If you set that off it will incinerate everything in here!

Isaac Clarke: Yes it will. Tell Stross to hold on, here we go…

[Dodging the monster Isaac picks up the cylinders and throws them into the tank. Soon everything starts to explode! Isaac runs as hard as he can to the elevator on the opposite side and barely has time to press the button for the elevator to start going up. Powerful explosions destroy everything around him.]

Ellie: (via radio) This whole place is going to blow! Get up here, fast! Isaac!

[Isaac runs into the train amid blinding flashes of explosions.]

Isaac Clarke: Ugh! Uh! Go! Go! Go! 

[Ellie starts the train.]

Isaac Clarke: Faster. Ellie! Faster!

Ellie: I can’t make it go any faster!

Isaac Clarke: Oh God. Come on.

[Only by some miracle do they manage to escape the fiery inferno in which they find themselves and make it out of the tunnel. Isaac is relieved to remove his helmet. The station chief appears on the transport screen.]

Tiedemann: In another situation, I might admire your persistence, Mr Clarke. But this is bigger than you and bigger than the lives of everyone on this station.

Soldier: Sir final preparations for evac are wrapping up.

Tiedemann: It looks like this ends here. At this point, it’s all just… dead weight.

Ellie: Isaac, what does he mean? What did he mean when he said dead weight?

Isaac Clarke: He’s using the solar beam! We have to stop the transport! Now!

Ellie: Oh shit!

[A powerful laser beam sweeps through space.]

Ellie: He… he cut the station in half. There’s no track to get across on.

Isaac Clarke: Back us up! Back us up to that station!

Ellie: What? Why?

Isaac Clarke: Just do it. Ellie! Hurry! Uh! The Ishimura. If the gravity tethers are still functional I can—

Ellie: …you can share Gov Sec and drag it back? Isaac, this is ridiculous.

Isaac Clarke: If I can line up the tracks for a few seconds you should be able to get the Transport across. Stay ready, and take care of Stross.

Ellie: Isaac, no, this is a really bad idea!

Isaac Clarke: Stick around. I’m full of bad ideas.

Chapter 10
[Isaac walks down a long transition corridor and rides a wagon. After a while he arrives at the very landing pad where the first game began!]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie, I’m in. There should still be a computer in the flight lounge. I can check the ship’s status from there.

Ellie: (via radio) Are you okay? You sound a little nervous.

Isaac Clarke: Last time I was here, things didn’t go so well. Look, I’ll contact you soon.

[When Isaac enters the ship he notices that almost everything is covered with white wrap and red scotch tape. Someone must have been on the ship and cleaned it up. Isaac looks around, finds the panel and checks the systems for proper operation.]

Computer: Gravity and Life support on reserve power. Primary systems offline. Main centrifuge offline for repairs.

Isaac Clarke: Damn it, that’s what I thought.

Ellie: (via radio) What?

Isaac Clarke: The gravity centrifuge is under repair. I’m going to have to go down to Engineering. This should be interesting.

Ellie: (via radio) Is it safe?

Isaac Clarke: I don’t know how it could be. I’ll let you know.

[He goes to the next room and carefully walks down the long corridor listening to every rustle holding the plasma cutter at the ready.]

Ghost of Nicole: You can pretend not to be bothered, but being here ratties you, doesn’t it Isaac? All this plastic and tape covering the scars - trying to hide the blood and the bodies so no one will ever know. But you remember what happened - no matter how deeply you try to bury it.

[Isaac moves on.]

Voice 1: Flight Control, this is flight I-S-H-one-five-one. Requesting permission to land.

Voice 2: This is flight control. Welcome back. Your shuttle has been authorized to land. Did you get it? Are the rumors true?

Voice 1: Roger, we have the payload and it is glorious. Altman be praised.

Voice 2: Roger that. I am notifying Captain Mathias and sending out a team to retrieve the payload.

Voice 3: We’re getting conflicting reports from the colony. Can you say again?

Voice 4: Over a hundred dead on the colony. Most from violent crimes, suicides.

Voice 3: God, what’s happening down there?

Voice 4: I don’t know, I was just glad to get the hell out of there. It’s like they’re all going crazy down there.

[Isaac continues to explore the wrap-draped corridors of the ship. As he enters a long tunnel, a giant necromorph, capable of knocking down a truck with his hands, runs toward him. Isaac stops its movement with stasis and places mines, retreating deep into the tunnel. With a lot of effort but he still manages to stop this monster! Other necromorphs appear, but they don’t give Isaac much trouble.]

Ellie: (via radio) Isaac! Isaac, they’re swarming into the ship!

Isaac Clarke: YEAH I KNOW! I’ll call you back!

[Isaac walks through the tunnel killing necromorphs. At the end he finds an elevator, repairs it and goes up. He ends up at one of the stations from which the original game transported him between decks.]

Isaac Clarke: Okay, no Ellie, it isn’t safe. But I’m on my way to the centrifuge.

Ellie: (via radio) Just be careful.

Isaac Clarke: I’ll call you when it’s online.

Computer: Warning: The Engineering deck has not completed final clean-up and decontamination.

[Isaac walks into the decontamination room where he was attacked last time he was there. He stands in the corner of the room and holds his plasma cutter at the ready.]

Computer: Decontamination initializing.

[However, nothing happens.]

Computer:Decontamination complete.

[He goes on to kill the necromorphs on his way.]

Computer: Entering Zero-Gravity

[Now he has to fix the centrifuge.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie. I’ve got the centrifuge on-line. I’m heading back towards the tram station.

Ellie: (via radio) Okay, I’ve almost got us disconnected from the mag-rail. Keep me posted.

[Isaac leaves the room and sees a flash of vision from the past of him being grabbed by a huge tentacle. He then has to go through the disinfection room again.]

Computer: Decontamination initializing.

[This time the necromorphs start breaking into all the windows of the room. Isaac takes out his Ripper and begins to chop up everyone who comes close to him. When the procedure is over, the room is filled with puddles of blood and severed parts of mutated bodies.]

Computer: Decontamination complete.

[Blood-soaked Isaac receives a call from Ellie.]

Ellie: (via radio) Isaac. Stross is starting to worry me, listen…

Nolan Stross: (via radio) …I would never, I would never. But son. Daddy’s not a murderer! I would never hurt you and Mommy.

Ellie: (via radio) Stross! He’s not real!

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Yes he is! You can’t see him because you haven’t taken the steps! The needle will make you see! Step three! Step three!

Ellie: (via radio) Stross, put down the screwdriver! Argh!

Isaac Clarke: Stross! Ellie? Shit!

[Isaac enters the station where he finds the trolley from the first game. He kills the necromorphs, who seem to have arrived at the station. Isaac launches the trolley.]

Ellie: (via radio) Aw Isaac… dammit that hurts. The bastard bit me.

Isaac Clarke: What? Oh shit. Are you okay?

Ellie: (via radio) Yeah I’m fine. But he’s stopped talking, and won’t look at me. How’s it going on your end? And please tell me this plan is going to work!

Isaac Clarke: I’m almost there. I’m headed to the bridge now to activate the gravity tethers.

Ellie: (via radio) Well good. They’re swarming in through a hole in the Medical Deck. At least you won’t have to go through there!

Computer: Unexpected obstruction ahead. Shutting down. Welcome to the Medical Deck.

Isaac Clarke: Crap.

[Isaac fearlessly walks out onto the deck, which looks even creepier than in the first game. The corridors are smeared with some kind of glowing blue liquid, probably blood, which glows in ultraviolet light.]

Ghost of Nicole: The Ishimura medical deck, Isaac. These were my last hours. Frightened, cold, alone. Well, go on Isaac. Don’t be shy.

[After cutting through the crowds of necromorphs, Isaac enters the medical bay where Nicole was working. On the monitors we see the same footage we saw at the end of the first game.]

Ghost of Nicole: (on video) Isaac. It’s me. I wish I could talk to you. I’m sorry. I’m sorry about everything. I wish I could just talk to someone… It’s all falling apart here: I just can’t believe what’s happening… It’s strange, such a little thing… In the end, it all comes down to just one little thing… I didn’t want it to end like this. I really wanted to see you again… just once. I loved you. I always loved you.

[The recording freezes at the moment of Nicole’s suicide. The lights in the room go out.]

Ghost of Nicole: You never found my body, never said goodbye. Was just stacked in the morgue with the others? Another random casualty? Or did they turn me into one of them? Wearing my bloodied face, stalking the halls looking for more victims….

Computer: Entering Zero-Gravity

Ghost of Nicole: The barrier between us is wearing thin, Isaac. Behind every tarp… a memory. Behind every door of the passage of time from my life to when I died.

Isaac Clarke: You’re not going to break me.

Ghost of Nicole: Why do you keep insisting these unpleasant memories are somehow my fault? This isn’t about the Marker, Isaac. This is about you.

Computer: Exiting Zero-Gravity

[Since the next tunnel is broken, Isaac has to fly to the next station on his own. Naturally, such a flight is not without its adventures.]

Isaac Clarke: Ellie? I’m almost to the Captain’s Nest to activate the tethers.

Ellie: (via radio) Alright. The centrifuge looks spooled to full power from here.

Isaac Clarke: Great. Let’s hope this works. It’ll be tight, you ready?

Ellie: (via radio) All set. I’ll wait for your signal.

[He walks into the captain’s bridge.]

Computer: Gravity tethers engaged…

Ellie: (via radio) You did it! Get back here!

Isaac Clarke: No, just go! I’ll use one of the escape pads and meet you there! Now go!

Tiedemann: (via radio) Clarke! You idiot! Those gravity tethers will tear the whole moon apart!

Isaac Clarke: Time to go…

[He leaves from the captain’s bridge and meets the ghost of his dead girlfriend.]

Ghost of Nicole: Where are you going, Isaac? Do you still think I’m something you can avoid?

Isaac Clarke: I don’t know. I don’t know what you are, okay?

[He gets into the pod.]

Computer: Election sequence initiated. Launch in 3… 2… Launch.

Isaac Clarke: I’m away! Ellie? Did you make it?

Ellie: (via radio) Isaac! We crossed the track… but we’re coming in hot!

Nolan Stross: (via radio) I just need you to see what I see. Ellie. I promise it won’t hurt…

Ellie: (via radio) Stross! Put down the screwdriver! Stross! No!!!

[Something happened and probably not very good, although Isaac has enough problems of his own.]

Computer: Proximity warning. Impact detected. Guidance system malfunction.

Isaac Clarke: Fuck.

Computer: All guidance systems offline.

Isaac Clarke: Oh shit!

Computer: Brace for impact.

[The pod crashes. While Isaac is unconscious, he sees something like in a dream.]

Ghost of Nicole: Isaac, are you there? You were right, Isaac! The Ishimura is a great ship! I am so lucky to be serving aboard her. You made me stick with it.

[She turns sharply on him.]

Ghost of Nicole: YOU MADE ME DIE!

[Isaac wakes up. He gets a video link from Ellie. She is lying on the floor trying to fight off the distraught Nolan.]

Ellie: (via radio) Isaac!

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Shhhh… It’s gonna be okay. I promise… this won’t hurt a bit. Cross my heart and hope to die…

Isaac Clarke: Stroooossss!!!

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Stick a needle in your eye!

Isaac Clarke: Stross! God dammit!

[Isaac runs to the rescue.]

Chapter 11
[Isaac hears an announcement at the scene of his crash.]

Loudspeaker: Attention shift workers. Abnormally high seismic activity in all sectors. Secure equipment and tools. The on-duty shift supervisor is Dom Regan.

[Isaac walks down a long corridor filled with bird-like necromorphs. He uses mines to deal with them quickly. In the next room, Nolan calls him. Isaac is very angry, both at himself and at this nutcase.]

Nolan Stross: (via radio) I seeeee you!

Isaac Clarke: Why did you do it, Stross?!

Nolan Stross: (via radio) I can’t face it! I thought Ellie could, I had to make her see. Step 3!

Isaac Clarke: What can’t you face? What’s the last step?

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Her! It’s what they were afraid of, that I’d face her, destroy the Marker. But it’s too much. You have to help. You need to see. Step 3.

Isaac Clarke: Stross!!! Dammit!

[He has to get through the mining complex filled with bloodthirsty necromorphs.]

Loudspeaker: Attention Shift Workers: Be mindful of the nearest survival chamber. These are your only hope of survival should a cave-in occur.

[Isaac walks down the frozen corridor and comes out to the survival chamber. Nolan jumps out of a window on his left. He’s holding a screwdriver with an eye on it.]

Nolan Stross: There you are, Isaac. We’ve been waiting for you! Now it’s your turn!

Isaac Clarke: Oh God, Ellie!

Nolan Stross: Step three, then you’ll- AARGHH!

[Ellie hits him over the head with a stick. Her left eye is poked out.]

Ellie: (to Isaac) You owe me an eye, you bastard!

Nolan Stross: The patient is not cooperating.

Ellie: Fuck you.

[She hits him again.]

Nolan Stross: She needs another session! Yes!

[The blinds close and Nolan and Ellie disappear from view. Isaac tries to get to them as quickly as possible. He hears voices from afar.]

Ellie: Don’t even try it!

Nolan Stross: It’s mine!

Ellie: AHH!

[Isaac runs toward them, but is grabbed by a worm-like necromorph and dragged into outer space.]

Nolan Stross: (via radio) Ellie lied! She won’t help. But you will Isaac, you’ll see her after Step 3.

Ellie: (via radio) Isaac, he’s run off deeper into the mines!

Isaac Clarke: I’ve got problems on this end to get somewhere safe.

Ellie: (via radio) I’ll try.

[Isaac redirects the lasers blocking access back to the station and flies back through a tunnel with exploding necromorphs.]

Computer: Exiting Vacuum

Isaac Clarke: Ellie. I’m back inside. Where are you? Where’s Stross?

Ellie: (via radio) I’m safe for now, but he’s lost it. I think he’s coming for you. I’ve found something you’re gonna wanna see. Here’s my location. Hurry and get here, I’m not in any shape to be fighting.

Isaac Clarke: I’ll get there as soon as I can. Stay safe.

[Isaac walks through the complex, doing his best to survive and searching every corner for ammo and medicine. He even manages to find a new blueprint for the suit at the far end of the complex!]

Loudspeaker: Attention Shift Workers: Your work practices are being monitored at all times. Please show pride in your work.

[Isaac goes on and breaks down a door in a long hallway. No sooner has he finished the job than the door opens and Nolan comes running out.]

Nolan Stross: There you are!

[He attacks Isaac and hits his helmet with a screwdriver, forcing him to open up. They start fighting each other.]

Isaac Clarke: Whoa Stross! What are you doing?!

Nolan Stross: You have to face her for me! Tell her I didn’t mean to do it!

Isaac Clarke: Stross, it’s me!

Nolan Stross: See her!

Isaac Clarke: It’s Isaac!

Nolan Stross: Tell her!

Isaac Clarke: Stross!

Nolan Stross: Step 3! Step 3! Oh God…

[Isaac overpowers the lunatic and sticks the screwdriver in his head.]

Isaac Clarke: Why did you do it, Stross?!

[He goes on and has another severe seizure.]

Ghost of Nicole: It was a shame what happened to Stross. That’s what happens when you fight it.

Isaac Clarke: Shut up! Just shut… up! The Marker… It was you… you made him do it! You made me kill him, didn’t you?

Ghost of Nicole: How is it you still haven’t come to terms with who I am? Who am I, Isaac? I will only ask you one more time before the end. Be ready.

[Isaac takes the elevator to the Exploration Mine.]

Loudspeaker: Attention Shift Workers: All persons are subject to search upon exiting the mines. Mineral resources, precious or otherwise, will be confiscated.

[As he enters the next room, Nicole suddenly grabs Isaac by the throat. She is embittered and determined.]

Ghost of Nicole: Moment of truth. Isaac! Who am I? Am I your friend? Your lover? The one shred; one light; one bright, shining star you clung to in this Universe? Or am I your guilt? Crushing the life out of you because you can’t get over the fact that I’m dead? That you feel responsible? Who… Am… I?!? Why do you keep fighting me? Why can’t you let go?

Isaac Clarke: Cause you were my everything. And it let you go, I got nothing left.

[Nicole’s face changes into the one she had when she was alive.]

Ghost of Nicole: Step four:  acceptance. Now you’re ready to finish this.

[She turns around and walks away.]

Chapter 12
[Isaac finds Ellie who is repairing a drilling machine.]

Ellie: Isaac, over here! looks like the mechanic was dragged away before he could finish fixing this.

Isaac Clarke: Stross is dead, Ellie.

Ellie: Well, I’m not sorry about that. So what happens now? I thought you needed Stross to destroy the Marker.

Isaac Clarke: Stross couldn’t lead us to the Marker. He was running away from his guilt.

Ellie: What about you?

Isaac Clarke: I’m not running anymore. I know what I have to do. Well, this drill is a stroke of good luck, finally. Why don’t you get up to the cab try to get it started. I’ll look for the other power cell.

Ellie: Alright. I’ll see what I can do from up here.

[Isaac picks up a battery from a stand nearby and inserts it into the drill.]

Ellie: (via radio) Hey, what’d you do? I just lost the control holograms.

Isaac Clarke: Yeah, the circuit junction shorted out. I have to find another one.

Ellie: (via radio) Well it’s standard, there should be another one around here somewhere.

Isaac Clarke: I’ll look. Any luck up there?

Ellie: (via radio) Well, no, not now.

Isaac Clarke: Right.

[He searches around and finds the device.]

Isaac Clarke: Found it.

Ellie: (via radio) Great. I think I’ve hotwired the system to bypass the navcards. Thank God.

Isaac Clarke: Yeah.

[He inserts the device into the drill.]

Isaac Clarke: It doesn’t recognize the new junction.

Ellie: (via radio) I think I’ve got it from up here.

Isaac Clarke: (quietly) Or maybe just rewire it from down here.

Ellie: What? Didn’t hear you.

Isaac Clarke: Nothing… Nothing.

[Isaac hacks into the panel. The drill starts up.]

Ellie: (via radio) I did it! I get it started!

Isaac Clarke: Uh…

Ellie: (via radio) There’s a lift on the other side. I’ll turn around and you can get on.

Isaac Clarke: Thanks.

[As she turns around, Isaac is attacked by several necromorphs, which he dealt with ease. He gets up on the lowered platform and climbs to the platform on top of the drill.]

Isaac Clarke: Ok. I’m on!

Ellie: (via radio) Alrighty, let’s see what this beast can do…

[They cut through the thick stone and flesh of necromorphs like butter.]

Ellie: These bastards are everywhere… The mines are swarming with these things. If there’re this many down here, how many do we think are above us? Hang on. We’re coming up on more of that stuff. Sorry…

[Isaac also gets attacked all the time, but his Ripper successfully cuts through the flesh of the necromorphs on the roof as well.]

Ellie: (via radio) You okay out there?

Isaac Clarke: Oh, yeah. Good times.

Ellie: (via radio) They’re climbing up the sides! I’ll try to keep them off! You just steer clear of those walls.

[They drive up to a huge gate that says Pylon 5 on it.]

Isaac Clarke: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Stop! STOP!

Ellie: Looks like we’ve reached the foundation pylons of the Government Sector.

Isaac Clarke: So how do we get in there?

Ellie: Straight ahead. We do have a giant drill.

Isaac Clarke: You know I’m riding on top of this thing, right? Ellie? Ellie? Ellie! Ellie! Ellie!

[She breaks through the wall along with the gate. Isaac flies in.]

Isaac Clarke: Ugh! Holy crap that hurt.

Ellie: Well, we can compare bruises later. But at least we made it, right? And this is most definitely government sector - and I’m guessing that Marker of yours is behind that huge door over there.

Isaac Clarke: Well, we better move fast. Those things are going to find a way up the hole we drilled. There’s gotta be an elevator or something connecting these floors. I’m gonna try to make my way to you.

Ellie: Alright, I’ll meet you halfway.

Chapter 13
[A few minutes after "landing," Ellie calls Isaac again to share the good news.]

Ellie: (via radio) Isaac, there’s a gunship docked here!

Isaac Clarke: What? Is it damaged?

Ellie: (via radio) Not that I can tell! Isaac, do you hear me? We’re going to make it out of here alive!

Isaac Clarke: One of us is. It’s too dangerous for you to stay here Ellie…

Ellie: (via radio) What are you talking about? Just get your ass in here. I’m starting a system check now.

[Isaac approaches the ship Ellie was talking about.]

Ellie: (via radio) Main power - ON. …auxiliary systems - booting up…

[Isaac closes the hatch and prepares her ship for departure.]

Ellie: (bia radio) Isaac, what are you doing? Whoa, hey Isaac what are you doing? Isaac! What are you doing? Open the door right now! No. No! No, don’t you dare, don’t you dare launch this ship!

Isaac Clarke: It’s your best chance Ellie. You got hile support, comms… Hey, you’re gonna be rescued.

Ellie: (via radio, crying) …you bastard…

Isaac Clarke: I need you to be rescued. I couldn’t save Nicole, but I can save you Ellie. So, uh… bye.

[He launches her ship with a smile on his face, then sits with his back to the wall and removes his helmet. Nicole’s ghost appears not far from him. She looks quite normal and speaks in a normal voice. Her appearance looks more like a memory than a seizure.]

Ghost of Nicole: Are you ready to talk now?

Isaac Clarke: Why? So I can let you go too? I can’t do that Nicole, I never wanted to let you go.

Ghost of Nicole: A lot happened that we never wanted. Isaac… touch me.

Isaac Clarke: I… don’t think that’s a good idea.

Ghost of Nicole: Isaac, please. Make us whole.

Isaac Clarke: I can’t.

[Nicole disappears. Isaac puts his helmet back on and continues on his way. He receives a video call from the station manager.]

Tiedemann: (via radio) I don’t know what Providence protects you, Clarke, but it ends here. I have two hundred armed security personnel… Every entrance is covered! Even if you do get in, you won’t get far.

[Isaac walks the white corridors in the half-destroyed government sector, fighting the necromorphs. In one of the corridors he is unexpectedly ambushed by guards. They are armed with automatic rifles and covered by shields.]

Security: Isaac Clarke! Stand down and drop your weapon! Open fire, open fire!

[Isaac moves sharply away from the rifle fire to the right where the toilet is located. From there he emerges into the technical corridor.]

Security: You’re surrounded, drop your tool and put your hands up!

Security: I don’t hear any movement. He may be dead.

Security: No. I’m still tracking his RIG. He’s alive. Squad 1, standby to close in on his position. Squad 1, standing by.

Security: Did he go… Where did he go?

Security: Target lost, move out, search the area.

Security: No sign of fugitive at bulkheads. Over.

Security: Copy that Lead.

Security: No sign of Clarke yet, port hallways clear. Moving onto starboard halls, over.

Security: Squad 1, stay in formation, keep the forward position secure.

Security: Copy that Lead.

Security: Alert Tiedemann Isaac is still loose, repeat, he’s still loose.

[Isaac goes into the control room where he turns off the lights by removing the battery.]

Security: Shit! We’ve lost power. Somebody get that auxiliary power turned on.

Security: What the hell was that?

Security: Fuck! That was the bulkhead door! The power outage must have knocked out the kinetic restraints. We think they may have gained access to the compound.

Security: Oh God, do you hear them? They’re coming in! They’re coming in!

Security: Open fire! Open fire!

[The guards are attacked and killed by necromorphs. An enraged Tiedemann calls Isaac by video link.]

Tiedemann: Y-you compromised the compound, you… idiot! If any of them reach the Marker… Fall back! Fall back to the Marker chamber! We have to seal it off!

[Isaac goes down to the hall where the guards were and finds a bloodbath. The floor is covered in blood and there are pieces of bodies everywhere. Necromorphs roam freely down the hall. He kills them and moves on to the next room, where he meets Nicole again. She seems a little pissed off at Isaac’s cold attitude toward her.]

Ghost of Nicole: Isaac, where are you going?

Isaac Clarke: I don’t know.

Ghost of Nicole: That’s why I’m here Isaac… …To show you the way.

[Her finger lights up as in E.T., after which she disappears.]

[After walking through the filthy, slimy warehouse, Isaac enters a long hallway where he has a seizure.]

Isaac Clarke: What is that? I can feel it in my head.

Ghost of Nicole: We’re getting closer, Isaac. The Marker knows you’re here.

Isaac Clarke: I still don’t know what to do.

Ghost of Nicole: When the time comes, you will.

[Isaac finds himself in a room with rotating lasers, which is also crammed full of necromorphs, most of whom are either too small to be touched by the lasers or already damaged and crawling on the floor.]

Isaac Clarke: Crap. Looks like I have to dodge these lasers to make my way around to the other side. This’ll be fun.

[Isaac rises in the elevator and comes out to a wide window overlooking a huge-looking structure. This structure is the Marker from the first game, but it is many, many times larger.]

Isaac Clarke: Oh my God. I built that? What - what are they doing?

Ghost of Nicole: They’re all coming to the Marker. Convergence is at hand…

Tiedemann: (via radio) Clarke! I knew you were trouble from the start! But they told me you were necessary. That your mind was the purest. I spent years sifting through your demented brain! This is not the way it was supposed to happen!

Isaac Clarke: Well, how was it supposed to happen, Tiedemann?

Tiedemann: (via radio) We had it under control! Clarke, this is not our fault! We were so close to understanding it!

[There is a powerful burst of yellow energy from the Marker, shaking everything around, both in Isaac’s location and also in Tiedemann’s. The ejection is accompanied by a trumpet-like sound.]

Isaac Clarke: What? It’s all those bodies. All those bodies you let in here! It’s triggering a Convergence event. But, we never… expected… This many bodies…

[Another ejection occurs and Tiedemann’s connection shuts down - there must have been some kind of malfunction on his side. Isaac is approached by Ghost of Nicole.]

Isaac Clarke: Why? What the hell is it doing?

Ghost of Nicole: What it was made to do, Isaac, you have to make us whole.

[Everything around him is shaking with the energy the Marker is erupting. Isaac goes into the next room, where he finds a device that looks like an MRI machine.]

Isaac Clarke: The Machine, just like Stross said. I remember this. The machine activates the parts of our brain where the Marker codes are stored. But how does that threaten the Marker? What were they afraid of?

Ghost of Nicole: Me. Us. Working together. 

Isaac Clarke: Step four.

Ghost of Nicole: Yes. Are you ready?

Isaac Clarke: This is going to hurt, isn’t it?

Ghost of Nicole: Yes. Step inside.

[Isaac climbs inside the device and lies down.]

Ghost of Nicole: Step one: Crawl inside.

[His head is fixed with grips, and his eyelids are opened with special clamps.]

Ghost of Nicole: Step two: The screws go tight all around. Cross my heart and hope to die…

[A needle with a laser sight is aimed at Isaac’s left eye.]

Ghost of Nicole: Stick a needle in your eye.

[Isaac successfully sticks a needle into the center of his pupil despite the resistance of his own body. His eye begins to bleed and his vision blurs like in his seizures. Isaac climbs out of the machine.]

Isaac Clarke: Nicole… where are you?

[Nicole appears in a flash of blinding light.]

Ghost of Nicole: Follow the light Isaac. I’ll be waiting for you at the Marker.

Isaac Clarke: But what do I do? …Dammit!

[Nicole disappears.]

Computer: Engaging auxillary power systems

[Isaac hears an eerie howl coming from somewhere.]

Chapter 14
[A creepy new necromorph with two jointed arms and lots of glowing eyes bursts into the room through the air duct. He has another interesting property - he regenerates ANY damage and is practically invulnerable, at least to Isaac’s weapons. Isaac turns the monster into a bloody mess and while it regenerates, he hacks the panel and runs out of the room. A grueling chase begins in which Isaac is transformed from hunter to prey. He uses every means available to him to at least slightly delay the invulnerable necromorph, who, among other things, deftly uses the ventilation and does not need to open doors. It is only in weightlessness that Isaac manages to break away.]

Computer: Entering Vacuum.

[However, fire and lasers await him here, requiring dexterity and reaction speed.]

Computer: Exiting Vacuum.

Ghost of Nicole: You’re fighting it, Isaac. You can’t fight it. You have to let me go.

Isaac Clarke: But I’ll never see you again!

Ghost of Nicole: Isaac. Stop it. There is no other way. You have to do this.

[Isaac walks down the last corridor leading to the Marker.]

Ghost of Nicole: This is it, Isaac. Convergence is almost here. Meet me at the Marker.

[Isaac prepares to face the battle. He improves his suit and purchases ammunition. After checking his gear, he walks out to the Marker.]

Chapter 15
[Isaac fights his way up the stairs and corridors leading to the Marker. He fights crowds of necromorphs, trying to avoid the necromorph-regenerator, which makes an already difficult situation even more dangerous! Eventually he gets to the Marker and immediately gets shot by a Javelin right in the shoulder!]

Tiedemann: The research in that Marker is worth every life we just lost.

[He appears out of a bright glow and at first Isaac thinks it is Nicole, but she was only standing behind him. Tiedemann shoots again, this time in the arm. We see Tiedemann’s body in its entirety - he is badly mangled. The left half of his body looks like it has been burned with acid. He looks a lot like Two-Face. Tiedemann points his Javelin at Isaac.]

Tiedemann: I won’t let you throw all this away.

[Isaac snatches the weapon from the weakened Tiedemann’s hands and hits him several times before driving an arrow through his throat. While Tiedemann is in agony, Isaac goes behind him and shoots another arrow through his head. Isaac walks up to Nicole and… hugs her.]

Ghost of Nicole: Thank you Isaac. Now… time to die.

Isaac Clarke: What?!

[Nicole’s ghost explodes with a stream of yellow energy into Isaac’s mind. There, on a wretched piece of land, they will have to fight.]

Ghost of Nicole: Yours is the last body we need to be reborn! The makers must be absorbed.

Isaac Clarke: The makers? You mean me? But Stross said we could destroy the Marker.

Ghost of Nicole: Not if we consume you first!

Isaac Clarke: Goddammit, I trusted you! Fuck you… and fuck your marker!

[He opens fire on Nicole. By wounding her, he opens the neural node connected to the Marker.]

Ghost of Nicole: You will all be made one. Make us whole. Isaac, stop you’re hurting me. Give up Isaac.

[After a few successful shots, Isaac destroys the neural node and returns to reality.]

Computer: Warning: Reactor containment destabilized A reactor breach is imminent Evacuation of all personnel is required. This is not a drill.

[Exhausted and wounded, he sits on the floor, waiting to die.]

Computer: Engaging auxillary power systems.

Computer: Warning: Reactor containment failure. A reactor breach is now in progress. Evacuate immediately, all personnel, all civilians. This is not a drill.

[While Isaac waits for his end, the credits run in the right part of the screen.]

Computer: Warning: Life Support failure. Seek protection immediately.

Ellie: (via radio) You complete bastard! Was this your great plan? Dump me off and die?

Isaac Clarke: I’m full of bad ideas, remember?

Ellie: (via radio) Yeah, well, here’s another one: I’m crashing through the roof to get you. Now move your ass!

Isaac Clarke: Wait! No! Ellie! Ellie… it’s too late! Steer clear of the station!

Ellie: (via radio) Yeah, well you don’t really have a say this time. Heads up!

[She breaks through the roof with her ship.]

Computer: Warning: Hull Breach. Decompression. Warning: Gravity failure.

[Isaac puts on his helmet and flies toward the ship, dodging wreckage.]

Ellie: Isaac, take my hand!

Isaac Clarke: I’m trying! I’m trying!

[Ellie drags him onto the ship.]

Ellie: Shut the hatch! Shut the hatch!

[As Isaac closes the hatch he sees the station explode!]

Isaac Clarke: Holy crap!

[Some time passes. Isaac is relieved to be reclining on the back of the ship’s passenger seat. Suddenly he realizes that he has been in a similar situation before and looks back at Ellie in horror.]

Ellie: What?

[There is nothing wrong with her. The screen goes off abruptly. Credits. The mind-blowing song Russian Circles - Fathom is playing. After the credits, there’s a little dialogue on a black screen.]

Flight Team EG-9: This is flight team EG-9 to Control. We have completed the fly-by. There’s nothing left I repeat. 

Control: Titan Station has been completely destroyed.

Flight Team EG-9: And the Marker?

Control: Negative. Nothing survived this, sir. Marker site 12 is a total loss.

Flight Team EG-9: Pity. Recall all flights and return to base. The other sites will have to pick up the pieces.

THE END
