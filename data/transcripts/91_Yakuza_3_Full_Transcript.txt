Note: For this script I used a walkthrough of the remastered version of the game because it has a patched translation. The original version stubbornly refers to Kazama as Fuma, and Kiryu has his last name and first name mixed up, and since I'm playing the original version, it really pisses me off.

Well… we made it. Let's enjoy the warm sun and the beaches of Okinawa! As a reminder, this game has a very strong emphasis on story. I highly recommend you to get acquainted with the previous games before reading this text. The order of games by story events: Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza Kiwami 2.

This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual persons living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

[Haruka sits on the sand of a small beach near a large house. The sun is shining brightly outside.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz!

[Our protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu, emerges from the ocean with a fish in his hands.]

Kiryu: Caught us some dinner. Now come on I'm sure everyone's starving.

Haruka: Okay!

[They're going to the big house. At the entrance there is a sign - あさがお (asagao) which means Japanese morning glory or just ivy. It could also stand for Rose of Sharon, but the plaque itself shows ivy, so I think that's what the authors had in mind. The children are having fun playing soccer. Kiryu comes out of the house.]

Kiryu: Dinner is served.

Haruka: Come sit down, everyone!

[They sit down at the table in front of the house. Kiryu places a plate of freshly caught fish in front of them. It's very nicely cooked. The kids are thrilled.]

Long Haired Kid: It's Uncle Rikiya!

[The children run to the young man who came.]

Kiryu: What happened to eating?

Long Haired Kid: Let's play catch, Uncle Rikiya!

Rikiya: (to Kiryu) Aniki.

Kiryu: What's up? Did something happen?

Rikiya: It's the boss. He… He's been shot.

[Kiryu is shocked by this news. The scene switches to a limousine driving down the road. Daigo and his advisor are sitting in it. Daigo seems to have gotten much more serious since the second game.]

Advisor: (via phone) Yes, of course. Just a moment. It's for you, Chairman.

Daigo: Who is it?

Advisor: They said you'd understand if I mentioned "the deal."

[Daigo lifts the tinted door glass and picks up the phone.]

Daigo:This is Dojima. Yes. I thought I told you I wasn't interested. Yes, that's right. The Tojo Clan wants no part in this. My answer is final. Add as many 0's as you want. I'm not going to budge. Goodbye.

[He hangs up.]

Advisor: Chairman. I assume that was about the Okinawa deal? Are you sure we can refuse?

Daigo: Meaning?

Advisor: Respectfully, sir. Hakuho payouts are the only thing keeping us afloat. If we agree to this Okinawa business… We'd earn enough to last us for at least a decade. Quick estimates show we could turn 100 billion yen, perhaps even more. Beyond that, a man like him would make for a vital government ally who—

Daigo: Enough! I'm well aware of the potential gains. But I won't let him take that land.

Advisor: Because of the fourth chairman, sir?

Daigo: After all he's done for the Tojo Clan… It wouldn't be right stealing the one place he belongs. Driver. Take us back to HQ.

Advisor: Sir? But what about the banquet?

Daigo: Cancel it. I need to make sure nobody thinks they can agree to this Okinawa deal behind my back.

[He returns to Tojo HQ.]

Yakuzas: Welcome back, sir!

[A yakuza runs up to Daigo.]

Yakuza: Chairman.

Daigo: What is it?

Yakuza: Someone's come seeking audience with you.

Daigo: Who?

Yakuza: Well…

[He tells Daigo the name.]

Daigo: What!?

Yakuza: There's no doubt. I didn't believe it myself, but it's him.

Daigo: And where is he?

Yakuza: Waiting in your office.

Daigo: All right.

[He goes to his office… and sees a ghost.]

Daigo: Kazama-san! But I thought you were…

Kazama: Sorry for the surprise.

[He throws a folder on Daigo’s desk.]

Daigo: What's this?

Kazama: Something very important to you.

Daigo: (reads the documents) This is… A deed to that land in Okinawa. But this is where the fourth chairman is—

Kazama: I'm aware. You had no interest in taking Kazuma Kiryu's land for yourself. So we went ahead and did it for you. No need to thank me.

Daigo: But… why?

Kazama: We can't let the Tojo walk from this deal. That outcome is simply unacceptable.

Daigo: Sorry, but… I've already made my decision. I don't want anything to do with this.

Kazama: You may want to reconsider, Sixth Chairman. With 30,000 members to support, can you really afford to refuse?

Daigo: What happens if I do?

[Kazama nods to the tough guy standing next to him and he takes the folder from Daigo's hands.]

Kazama: We'll do what must be done.

[He reaches into the inside pocket of his jacket. Daigo is shocked. He pulls out a gun, a shot goes off… and Daigo falls to the floor. The scene changes to a hospital. Kiryu and Rikiya run to the operating room. They are greeted by a fat guy in a tracksuit.]

Fat Guy: Sir!

Kiryu: Where's Nakahara?

Fat Guy: On the operating table.

Rikiya: And? Is he okay? How's he doing!? (punches the wall) Dammit!

[Haruka approaches a sad girl with a sketchbook in her hands.]

Haruka: Saki-chan. You must be terrified.

Kiryu: Saki… Are you okay?

[Saki nods.]

Kiryu: (to the fat guy) We know who did it?

Fat Guy: Nope. He and the little lady were alone when it happened. Guy came in, shot him right in the stomach.

Kiryu: Another family out for revenge?

Fat Guy: No. I think it's gotta do with the land deal. The deed's up and gone missing from the office.

Kiryu: What?

Rikiya: It's gotta be those Tamashiro assholes! They've been gunning for us nonstop since last year!

Fat Guy: Nah, I don't think it was them.

[Saki stands up.]

Kiryu: What's wrong, Saki?

[She shows Kiryu her sketch.]

Fat Guy: Who's that?

Kiryu: (shoked) What the!? Is this the man who shot him?

[Saki nods.]

Haruka: But that's…

Rikiya: Aniki. You know him, don't you?

Kiryu: He's the man who brought me up. Shintaro Kazama. My dead father.

Chapter 1: NEW BEGINNINGS
January 2007
Kamurocho, Japan

[It has become customary at the beginning of the new year for Kiryu to visit the cemetery to honor the dead. The scene partially repeats the ending of the second game. Kaoru brings flowers.]

Kaoru: Today's the day, huh?

Kiryu: Yup.

Kaoru: …Right. I'm here to say goodbye, too. We can get to that later, though. I assume you'd like to pay your respects to the people you've lost first.

Kiryu: Yeah, it might be nice to stop for a second and reflect on everything that’s happened.

[He approaches Terada’s grave.]

Kiryu: (Terada… You were one of the leaders of a Kansai yakuza conglomerate known as the Omi Alliance. Despite working for our rivals, you owed Kazama-san a huge debt, leading you to try and stop the Tojo Clan's infighting over the missing 10 billion yen. After seeing the kindness and generosity in your heart, I decided to leave the Tojo Clan in your hands. To protect the weakened Tojo from the Omi Alliance, you opted to call a truce with their leader, Jin Goda. But it was all part of a plot to take revenge for the Jingweon massacre from over twenty years earlier. Even so, you owed your life to Kazama-san. That's why I chose to believe you when you asked me to trust you as you died. Because of you, Terada… I learned never to give up on people, even when things take a turn for the worst. I hope someday the Tojo Clan becomes the kind of organization you always wanted it to be. Until that day, watch over them… Please.)

Kaoru: Are you finished, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Yeah, I’ve done all I need to.

Kaoru: Right… I guess you'll be leaving, then.

Kiryu: Yup, heading down to Okinawa tomorrow morning.

Kaoru: You know, I never pegged you as the kind of guy to start an orphanage.

Kiryu: It's been a dream of mine to take care of kids, though. Just like Kazama-san did for me when I had nowhere to turn.

Kaoru: A textbook Kazuma Kiryu response if I've ever heard one. But why Okinawa?

Kiryu: There's a place there with ties to Sunflower. When their old manager died, they asked me if I knew anyone who might be able to lend a hand.

Kaoru: And you decided that person should be you?

Kiryu: It seemed like the perfect opportunity. Aren't many opportunities for an ex-yakuza out in the wild, anyway.

Kaoru: I hear Okinawa’s beautiful, too.

Kiryu: Yeah, and the orphanage is right down by the beach. You should come visit when you get the chance.

Kaoru: I'd love that… but I doubt I'll be able to for a while.

Kiryu: Why’s that?

Kaoru: Well… I'm actually leaving the country. Tomorrow.

Kiryu: Where to?

Kaoru: The U.S. They're starting a training program for a new branch of the Metropolitan Police, and they've asked me to be an instructor.

Kiryu: …Is it really that simple?

Kaoru: You'd probably try to stop me if I said more. Might be best to just leave it at that.

Kiryu: …Right. Well, I can't say I'm not happy for you. It's good to see you following your heart.

Kaoru: (laughs) I thought you'd say that. And besides, I don't think you'd like it very much if I turned them down to stay with you.

Kiryu: Heh, guess not.

Kaoru: There's still a lot I want to accomplish as a police officer, Kiryu-san. Career goals, you know. And… I think America's the best place for me to do that.

Kiryu: You're probably right.

Kaoru: So let's… go our separate ways. For now. I'll come find you once I've done what I need to do, okay? Promise.

Kiryu: …It’s a promise.

[Date and Sudo are quietly watching them.]

Date: Y'know, I'd always thought they'd end up together.

Sudo: Seems it wasn’t meant to be. Sayama-kun is an ambitious girl, after all.

Date: You can say that again. (tries to light a cigarette) Outta gas,

Sudo: (pulls out his lighter) Here.

Date: Thanks.

Sudo: You can hang on to it. Think of it as a gift. No smoking in Division 1, anyway.

Date: Division 1?

Sudo: Yes. I'll be transferring, effective next month. And unlike 4, Division 1 has a reputation to uphold. Can't be seen smoking on the job.

Date: Look at you getting promoted! Congrats.

Sudo: I'm not sure it's cause for celebration. Think back to the feud between the Tojo Clan and Omi Alliance. Prefectural Police did a damn thing to stop it. And given Division Chief Karahashi’s involvement with the Jingweon… The force's reputation has hit rock bottom.

Date: They why’re you going back to Div 1?

Sudo: It's essentially a bribe. Everyone involved has been promoted, including both myself and Sayama-kun. I suppose they think keeping us happy will also keep us quiet about what happened.

Date: Eh, a promotion's a promotion. Doesn't matter how you got it you're an elite again.

Sudo: I suppose, yes.

Date: You don't sound too pleased.

Sudo: That's because I'm worried.

Date: About what?

Sudo: What happens to Kamurocho. The police are planning to back off both the Tojo and the Omi for the time being. Remove themselves from yakuza matters. It’s only right after what they did to spare our blushes.

Date: Fair enough. So? What's worrying you, then?

Sudo: I still don't trust the yakuza. If Kiryu-san won't be leading the Tojo Clan… I fear Kamurocho will simply fall back into the muck.

Date: You can rest easy, then. Guy like him always has a plan. After all he did, he's not gonna just let things go to shit. And you can take that to the bank.

Kiryu: Well, we should probably get going.

Kaoru: Right. Off to Kamurocho, I assume?

Kiryu: Right. Kazuki and Yuya deserve a goodbye. And…

Kaoru: And what?

Kiryu: There's someone else I need to talk to before I leave.

Kaoru: About the Tojo Clan, I'm sure.

Kiryu: Yup. At this rate, Daigo'll end up the Tojo Clan's sixth chairman. But he's still young. I'm not sure he has the strength to lead just yet.

Kaoru: So you'll need someone to support him. Did you have anyone in mind?

Kiryu: There's a guy who's been working with the Tojo just as long as I have, yeah.

Kaoru: I know just who you mean. But do you really think Daigo has what it takes to tame him?

Kiryu: Nobody does. You and I both know that.

Kaoru: Goro Majima… I wonder if he'd even find the Tojo appealing in its current state. I'm sure you're thinking the same.

Kiryu: You've got that right.

Kaoru: Do you think you can convince him?

Kiryu: Don't have much choice. That's why I'm going to see him today, one way or another.

Kaoru: Hopefully that “persuasion” doesn't involve your fists,

Kiryu: Eh. I guess we'll find out soon enough.

Kaoru: Stay safe.

Kiryu: Same to you. Well, it's time we get going.

Haruka: Bye.

[They return to Kamurocho.]

Haruka: This is probably the last time we'll be in Kamurocho together, huh?

Kiryu: Of course not. We can still come visit. What's wrong?

Haruka: I just wanna have fun today. Me and you, Uncle Kaz. Can we?

Kiryu: Of course. Kamurocho won't know what hit it.

Haruka: Let's go see Uncle Kazuki and Uncle Yuya!

Kiryu: Right. They deserve a farewell after all they’ve done for us. (Time to pay those two a visit. Stardust is just down the street.)

[They meet Yuya sitting on a crate near the club and smoking.]

Kiryu: Little early to be slacking off. Huh, Yuya?

Yuya: Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: So? What’s the getup?

Yuya: Oh, just gettin' my clean on. Those Go-Ryu punks tore the place up real bad. Everyone’s really been pitchin’ in, though.

Haruka: So they're doing all the work while you smoke?

Yuya: What!? You got it all wrong, Haruka-chan! I was just takin’ a little breather!

Kiryu: Heh. By the way, how are you feeling?

Yuya: What, me? Better than ever, man! It'll take more than a few punches to put a dent in ol’ Yuya. Urgh… It hurts to laugh.

Kiryu: If that's "better than ever," I don't wanna see what you hurt looks like. Oh, and how's Kazuki doing?

Yuya: Still over with the doc. Sounds like it's still gonna be a while 'til he can come home… But he's doin’ good!

Kiryu: Glad to hear it. By the way, Yuya… We're actually here to say goodbye.

Yuya: Huh!? Whaddya mean, “goodbye"!?

Kiryu: I'm moving to Okinawa. Gonna be taking over an orphanage down there.

Yuya: And you're goin’ too, Haruka-chan?

Haruka: Mhm!

Kiryu: The place actually has pretty close ties to Sunflower, too. After what Haruka and I have been through, I think it'll feel good looking after some kids myself.

Yuya: Well, that's outright charitable of ya, man. But I gotta say, it's gonna be lonely 'round here without you.

Kiryu: It's not like we're gonna be that far. We can still see each other, you know. You could even come visit us sometime.

Yuya: Y'know, that ain't such a bad idea! I'll ask Kazuki-san about takin' the team down there for our next vacation!

Kiryu: Heh, sounds like a plan. Speaking of, I'm actually thinking to go see Kazuki now.

Yuya: Oh yeah? Sure he'll be happy to see you.

Kiryu: Hope so. Anyway, Yuya… Take care of this place while Kazuki’s out of commission, okay?

Yuya: I'll do what I can. Well, Kiryu-san… I guess this is it. Good luck down there. Oh, and you too, Haruka-chan!

Haruka: Bye, Uncle Yuya! Don't forget to come visit!

[Kiryu and Haruka continue to stroll around town and walk into a convenient store.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz… I can't go another step… I'm gonna collapse…! Only a Tauriner can save me…! Uncle Kaz! Will you buy me a Tauriner?

Kiryu: (Haruka wants me to get her a Tauriner…)

[He buys what she wants.]

Kiryu: (Haruka seems happy…)

[They walk to Emoto Medical Clinic.]

Haruka: This is where Uncle Kazuki is, right?

Kiryu: Yup. Something up?

Haruka: Well, I was just thinking… Can we go have some fun after we see him?

Kiryu: Heh. Of course, Haruka.

???: Just a sec there, buddy!

Kiryu: Can I help you?

Cocky Punk: This town's no place to be bringin' a little girl, old man. You get lost on your way to the fun fair?

Kiryu: None of your business. Now back off, or I'll make you back off.

Cocky Punk: Ooooh! I'm sooo scared!

Belligerent Thug: Dude, what's with this asshole? Guy's pissing me off.

Cocky Punk: Sure, pal. We'll back off… if you hand over some cash. I mean, that girl of yours gets an allowance, yeah? How ‘bout sharing the wealth?

Kiryu: Sorry, not happening.

Cocky Punk: Just fork it over, man! You don't wanna get your ass beat in front of your kid, do ya?

Belligerent Thug: You even listening, you old fuck!?

Kiryu: Look. If you get lost now, I'll forget this ever happened. But if you stick around… you're gonna pay. Promise.

Belligerent Thug: You think you can take us, asshole!?

Cocky Punk: You're the only one who's gonna be payin' today, man. Either in cash, or in blood. Your choice.

Kiryu: I'll get you some blood if you want… but it's not gonna be mine, if you catch me.

Cocky Punk: Ha, good one! You're gonna regret this!

[Kiryu teaches the punks to think before acting.]

Kiryu: Well? Had enough?

Cocky Punk: Shit! I'm sorry, man! We'll get outta your hair! No harm, no foul… yeah?

Kiryu: I don't remember saying you could leave.

Cocky Punk: Eep! Please don't kick our asses anymore, old man!

Kiryu: You really don't know how to talk to your elders, huh? Am I gonna have to beat some more manners into you?

Cocky Punk: Wait, no! No more beating, please! Anything but more beating! Just, please. Let us go!

Kiryu: Hmph. Maybe next time you'll remember your place.

Cocky Punk: Yeah, of course! I'm goin' on the straight and narrow! Promise!

Kiryu: …Fine. Get out of here.

Cocky Punk: Oh thank god! I mean… thank god, sir! C'mon boys, let's leg it!

[They run away.]

Kiryu: Kids these days. You all right, Haruka?

Haruka: Mhm!

Kiryu: Good. Now let's go see your Uncle Kazuki.

Haruka: Okay!

[They enter the clinic.]

Kiryu: Hey, Kazuki. How are you feeling?

Kazuki: Oh, Kiryu-san! Did you come all the way here just to see me? The doc says it'll still be a while until I can go home, but I'm on the mend at least.

Kiryu: Right. You're looking pretty healthy.

Kazuki: Thanks. Means a lot coming from you.

Haruka: Um, Uncle Kazuki? We're actually here to say goodbye.

Kazuki: …Goodbye? Are you two going somewhere, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: Yup. The Go-Ryu and the Jingweon have been dealt with, and Daigo's come around to being the next chairman. My job here is done.

Haruka: We're moving to Okinawa!

Kazuki: Okinawa, huh? That's pretty far.

Kiryu: Yeah, that's… kinda the point. Haruka and I are gonna be running an orphanage down there.

Kazuki: Wow. I can't say we won't miss you, Kiryu-san… but I’m sure you’ll be great.

Kiryu: Heh, Yuya said pretty much the same thing.

Haruka: Oh, he also said you'd come visit us!

Kazuki: We have been looking for places to take the boys for some team building. Can't think of a better place than Okinawa.

Haruka: You better not forget!

Kazuki: Don't worry, Haruka-chan. We'll visit you soon. Kiryu-san… Thank you for everything. I owe you my life.

Kiryu: Don't be ridiculous. If it wasn't for me and the Tojo Clan, you never would have ended up like this in the first place. I hope you can forgive me.

Kazuki: Don't be like that, Kiryu-san. I can't imagine a Kamurocho without you. This town owes you and Kazama-san more than you realize… so please. There’s no need to apologize.

Kiryu: …If you say so. Thanks again, Kazuki.

Kazuki: Of course. And… take care of yourself, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: I will.

Haruka: Feel better soon, Uncle Kazuki!

Kazuki: Thanks, Haruka-chan. Be good down in Okinawa, okay? I don't want to hear about you getting into any trouble.

Haruka: Hehe, okay! Bye!

[Kiryu approaches Dr. Emoto.]

Emoto: I hear you’re leaving Kamurocho?

Kiryu: Yeah, now that everything's settled down. By the way, how’s Kazuki doing?

Emoto: He'll be fine soon enough. It's still some time 'til he'll be out on the street, but he's progressing nicely.

Kiryu: Good to know.

Emoto: Did you drop in on the Tojo Clan yet?

Kiryu: Nope, and I'm not planning to. Daigo and Yayoi-san have enough on their plates already rebuilding the organization. Besides, the Tojo don't need me now that Daigo’s in charge.

Emoto: I wouldn’t be so sure about that…

Kiryu: It's all right. I left a letter for Daigo over with Kashiwagi-san. There is one thing I need, though…

Emoto: Hm? What’s that?

Kiryu: I need to see a certain someone before I leave Kamurocho for good.

Emoto: … Majima. You're gonna ask him to look after Daigo, huh?

Kiryu: Yeah. If we want all the other families to accept Daigo as their leader, we need a big man like Majima to come forward and do it first.

Emoto: Can't you just step in if anyone starts giving him trouble? What’s it have to be Majima?

Kiryu: I'm out of the clan, that's why. Besides…

Emoto: What?

Kiryu: It's not that long ago that the Tojo wanted me dead. Even now, I have my fair share of enemies in the clan.

Emoto: Meaning the Mad Dog's your only option.

Kiryu: That's right. None of the patriarchs would dare mess with Majima, but if Daigo can show he's got him on a leash…

Emoto: The other families would have to follow suit. I get it. …So, you're gonna go see him now?

Kiryu: Yeah. Mind if I leave Haruka here while I'm out?

Emoto: What, the girl? Of course, of course. No problem at all.

Kiryu: Thanks, Emoto.

Haruka: Are you going somewhere, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: …Yeah. I need to talk to Majima-san before we leave.

Haruka: Can I come?

Kiryu: Sorry, but I need you to be a big girl and stay here, okay? Majima-san and I have some adult things to discuss.

Haruka: Oh… Well are you going now? I thought we were gonna spend some time together…

Kiryu: Well, maybe a little more time wouldn't hurt.

Haruka: Yay! Where do you wanna go!?

[They go out. Haruka notices an ice-cream store.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz! We should get some gelato!

Employee: Welcome. Have you decided what you would like to order?

Haruka: Wow, I really want a Strawberry Gelato! Could you get me one, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: (Haruka wants me to get her a Strawberry Gelato…)

[Kiryu buys Haruka what she wants. The description reads “Strawberry gelato is especially popular with girls for its uniquely sweet and tangy flavor.”]

Haruka: Thanks, Uncle Kaz! I can't wait to dig in!

Kiryu: (Haruka seems happy…)

Haruka: Uncle Kaz, let's go in here! I'm starving! Uncle Kaz! I want some Pork Rice! It's hard to go wrong with a classic like this!

Employee: Welcome. Have you decided what you would like to order?

Haruka: Uncle Kaz! Can I get some Pork Rice?

Kiryu: (Haruka wants me to get her some Pork Rice…)

[Kiryu buys Haruka what she wants. The description reads “Our Pork Rice meal is a new menu item. We make sure to bring out the original pork flavor. Comes with miso soup.”]

Haruka: Thanks, Uncle Kaz! I was really craving this!

Kiryu: (Haruka seems happy…)

[After eating together Kiryu and Haruka return to Emoto’s Clinic.]

Haruka: Are you going somewhere, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: …Yeah. I need to talk to Majima-san before we leave.

Haruka: Oh… Well are you going now? I thought we were gonna spend some time together…

Kiryu: Sorry, Haruka. It has to be now.

Haruka: … All right. Just don't take too long, okay?

Meet up with Majima
Kiryu: (Better go see Majima-san. I'm sure he's somewhere in town. Guess I'll have to track down someone from his family.)

[He runs into the same street punks from before.]

Cocky Punk: Well, well, well! Look who it is!

Kiryu: Oh, you're the brats from before. What now?

Cocky Punk: Grrr, you think you're hot shit, huh!? This is the guy, senpai!

Imposing Punk: Oho? So you're one who beat up my tender little friend here, huh?

Cocky Punk: Hehehe! You're in trouble now, old man! Our senpai here's in the Kazama Family! Yeah, that's right! The guys who own this damn town! Well? You shittin' yourself yet?

Kiryu: Uh…

Cocky Punk: Look at this bitch! He's so scared he can't even talk!

Imposing Punk: What's wrong, cat got your tongue? Way I hear it, you were acting real tough toward my pals here not too long ago. Well guess what? I'm here to even the odds! You catch me?

Kiryu: Well…

Imposing Punk: Look man, I got a Kazama Family pin right here! They don't go handing these out on the street, y'know! Now if you don't wanna meet my big fists, I might be able to find it in my heart to forgive you… for a price.

Kiryu: Heh.

Cocky Punk: The shit are you laughin' at!?

Kiryu: A Kazama Family pin, huh? Funny. Back in my day, nobody'd dare brag about their loyalty without knowing who they were up against. That's how you get yourself killed, kid.

Imposing Punk: Oh yeah!?

Kiryu: Look, just do yourselves a favor and run along now. I'm not interested in wasting my time with scum like you.

Imposing Punk: You think you can boss Kazama Family boys around!? We're gonna bash your fuckin' brains in!

[Kiryu easily mops the asphalt with this garbage.]

Kiryu: What happened? I thought you were gonna teach me a lesson.

Not-So-Imposing Punk: Shit, he's strong…

[A yakuza rushes in.]

Yakuza: What in high hell's goin' on over here? Someone causin' trouble on our turf!?

Not-So-Imposing Punk: Aniki, help! This guy's gonna fucking wreck us!

Yakuza: Looks like he already did, Hiroshi. He start shit with you?

Hiroshi: Yeah! He's got beef with the Kazama Family or somethin’!

Kiryu: Hold your horses there. You're the ones who started this, not me.

Hiroshi: Grrr! Shut up, you old bitch!

Yakuza: Oh, well if it ain't the Fourth Chairman! How you been? (bows)

Hiroshi: …Huh?

Yakuza: Don't "huh" me! Go on and introduce yourself, idiot! This man here's Kazuma Kiryu, Tojo Clan fourth chairman!

Hiroshi: Huh?

Cocky Punk: But…

Belligerent Thug: Him?

Kazama Family Ruffians: What!? (bows) It's an honor to meet you, sir!

Kiryu: You there. You're Kazama Family, too?

Yakuza: Yes, sir! The name's Aniki, but you can call me Aniki.

Kiryu: …I think I'll just stick to Aniki. Anyway, do you knowwhere I can find Majima-san?

Aniki: Hm… That's a good question. Since he left the Tojo Clan to start Majima Construction, it's been impossible to know where he might pop up. Though now that I think about it, he was actually scheduled for a meetin' with the boss today. You might catch him over at the Kazama Family office if you’re lucky.

Kiryu: Thanks, I go take a look.

Aniki: Oh, and um, Fourth Chairman…

Kiryu: Yeah?

Aniki: My boys didn't offend you, did they?

Kiryu: ……Nah, it was nothing. They could just use a little more education.

Aniki: That so? Guess I'll have to beat some manners into 'em then.

Kiryu: Don't worry, I already did. Just keep an eye on them, make sure they take the lesson they learned today to heart.

Aniki: I do that, sir! Thank you, sir!

Kiryu: Well, I should get going.

Kazama Family Ruffians: (bows) Goodbye, Fourth Chairman!

[After getting the information he needs, Kiryu goes to Majima.]

Kiryu: (Sounds like Majima-san's at the Kazama Family office over in the Millennium Tower. Time to move.)

[When Kiryu approaches the Tower, Majima's sidekick runs up to him.]

Hat-Donning Man: Oh, Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: It's Nishida, right? What are you up to?

Nishida: Oh, well the boss had some business with Kashiwagi-san, so I came over with him. But once we got  here… he told me to just go home. The problem is, if I really do up and leave, I'll totally get chewed out later. So, I'm sticking around for now.

Kiryu: Huh. I was actually heading over to see Majima-san myself. Is he still with Kashiwagi-san?

Nishida: Doubt it. The boss thinks meetings are "the most boring shit in the world,' so I doubt it lasted longer than half an hour.

Kiryu: Then where is he now?

Nishida: On the roof, most likely. Looking down on the city. He may not look it, but he's actually a big softie. I'm sure he's torn up about you leaving Kamurocho, Kiryu-san. And hey! Don't tell the boss I said he's soft! Think I'd end up losing an eye myself if he found out…

Kiryu: Heh, I won't. Take care of yourself, Nishida.

Nishida: Same goes for you, Kiryu-san! Oh, before you go. The boss has been kinda… catty lately. You might wanna be careful. Who knows what'll set him off? You know what? Here, you should take this. Better safe than sorry, I always say!

[He gave Kiryu a few bottles of Staminan X. Kiryu gets to the top of the Millennium Tower and finds Majima on the helipad.]

Majima: I hear you're bailin' on Kamurocho. Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: Yeah. That's actually why I'm here.

Majima: Whaddya mean?

Kiryu: I need your help. Someone has to watch over Daigo while I'm gone.

Majima: What're ya gettin' at, Kiryu-chan?

Kiryu: I think I was pretty clear.

Majima: Ya can't seriously want me goin' back to the Tojo.

Kiryu: …I do.

Majima: Well too bad. Ain't much point in it now. Clan's just not the barrel o' monkeys it used to be.

Kiryu: Listen, Majima-san. Daigo's taking over as sixth chairman, but he could end up in some trouble without a family of his own.

Majima: Meanin' you want my muscle backing him up?

Kiryu: Please. Your family's the only thing that can save the Tojo Clan now.

Maijima: …Gonna have to pass.

Kiryu: Majima-san…

Maijima: C'mon, Kiryu-chan. You know what I'm like. Livin' life caged up like a damn shelter dog ain't my scene and you know it. But that's exactly what I'm doing. Givin' up my freedom to keep my family afloat. But now you come marchin' up here asking me to babysit your little protégé on top of that? Sorry, ain't gonna happen.

Kiryu: Somehow I knew that's what you'd say.

Majima: What?

Kiryu: Majima-san. You wanna be free, right?

Majima: Yup.

Kiryu: But instead you're feeling trapped. Cooped up.

Majima: Yup.

Kiryu: Well then this is the perfect chance for you to break out.

Majima: Huh? The flyin' shit are you talkin' about?

Kiryu: Once Daigo takes over, there'll be no shortage of people for you to fight. You can go wild like you've never gone before.

Majima: How's that!?

Kiryu: You can be his enforcer. Anyone even thinks about betraying Daigo, you get full license to put them back in line.

Majima: You… sayin' what I think you're sayin', Kiryu-chan?

Kiryu: You bet. It's time Kamurocho sees what the Majima Family can really do.

Majima: ……

Kiryu: So I'm not asking you to babysit, Majima-san. I'm asking you to let loose. Because the more ass you kick, the better off the Tojo Clan, and Daigo, will be.

[Majima takes off his jacket.]

Majima: (madly laughs) Ya know what I'm about by now. The stronger they come, the more I'm gonna like 'em. Meanin' I'm not keen on takin' orders from snot-nosed little brats.

Kiryu: I know.

Majima: So if ya want me back on the Tojo's side, you're gonna have to force me!

Kiryu: Somehow I knew it'd go like this.

Majima: Then let's get rollin', Kiryu-chan.

[Kiryu takes off his jacket too.]

Majima: Feels like ages since we threw down. But y'know… I'm not gonna pull any punches.

Kiryu: Fine by me.

Majima: Then bring it! Kiryu-chan!

[Kiryu kicks Goro’s ass easily.]

Majima: That's my Kiryu-chan. Strong as a fuckin' ox. Guess this is the end of the line.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Majima: Gonna be real lonesome without ya, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: Take care of Daigo for me.

Majima: Ya got my word. There's just one thing worryin' me.

Kiryu: What's that?

Majima: If he starts goin' down a weird path, don't think I'll be able to stop him.

Kiryu: What do you mean by that?

Majima: Daigo… I mean the sixth chairman. He's real trustin', just like you. Hope he doesn't let anyone pull the wool over his eyes.

Kiryu: Don't worry. Daigo's young, but he's not a fool. I should get going. The Tojo Clan's in your hands now.

[Kiryu leaves.]

Majima: The hell’d I get myself into this time? Eh, whatever! Goro Majima's… Gonna rule the fuckin' world! Won't be a walk in the park… But hey, Kiryu-chan beat me fair n' square. Guess I gotta go full throttle!

Chapter 2: THE RYUDO ENCOUNTER
Six Months Later
Summer 2007, Okinawa

[Kiryu tensely cuts something… it’s an onion.]

Fat Boy: Uncle Kaz! I thought curry was supposed to be easy!

Kiryu: I'm trying to focus here. Don't interrupt me!

Haruka: How many times do I have to tell you, Taichi?

Taichi: That hurts, sis! (untranslated)

Haruka: You can't bother him while he's cooking.

[Kiryu nods appreciatively. Haruka nods back.]

Haruka: Now come on. Let's go play outside 'til dinner's ready.

[It's time for dinner. There are a dozen plates of simple meat curry and rice on the table. The children run into the room.]

Long Haired Boy: I’m so hungry! (untranslated) Oh man, curry!

Haruka: Spoons down! You know we don't eat until everyone's at the table!

Long Haired Boy: Yeah, yeah…

Taichi: (runs in) Oh, curry! (untranslated)

Girl with Pigtails: (runs in) Food! (untranslated)

Haruka: Looks like we're all here. Wait. Where's Izumi?

Ugly Girl: Huh? Izumi-chan's still out?

Girl with Pigtails: I don't know. Shiro! Weren't you supposed to walk her home from school?

Shiro: I did. She was with me the whole time.

Kiryu: To be dear, Shiro… you don't know where she is?

Shiro: Nope.

Haruka: I wonder where she went…

Taichi: It's fine, let's just eat without her!

Long Haired Boy: Totally! I'm sure she's okay.

Haruka: What do we do, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: We go find her. You all can go ahead without us.

Taichi: Yay, finally!

Children: Let’s eat! (untranslated)

[Haruka and Kiryu leave the room.]

Find Izumi
Haruka: Hm… Where do you think Izumi-chan went?

Kiryu: Hard to say for sure. I'll go take a look around outside. You check in the house, Haruka.

Haruka: All right.

Kiryu: Thanks, Haruka. I'll head outside, check the neighborhood.

[Now Kiryu has his own room where he can store his items and save the game!]

Tadashi's Mother: Izumi-chan over at the Morning Glory Orphanage is the same age as you, but she's so polite and always has a smile on her face. You should be more like her.

Tadashi: Izumi? Smiling? No way. She's a total mope, and she never stops fidgeting. Maybe if she had parents, she wouldn't be such a weirdo.

Tadashi's Mother: Tadashi, how could you!? She lost her parents in a terrible accident, the poor thing! You be nice to her! You hear me!?

Tadashi: Aww… But I don't wanna…

[Kiryu speaks to an elderly woman.]

Kiryu: Hi there.

Elderly Neighbor: Well if it isn't Kiryu-san. Need something, dearie?

Kiryu: Izumi's supposed to be home for dinner, but I can't find her. Have you seen her around?

Elderly Neighbor: Oh, I'm pretty sure I saw her walking down on the beach. She was looking kinda glum, now that I think about it.

Kiryu: All right, thanks. I'll go take a look.

[Kiryu goes to the beach.]

Kiryu: What's wrong, Izumi? You're usually the first one at the dinner table.

Izumi: …I don't wanna eat right now.

Kiryu: What? Are you feeling okay?

Izumi: ……

Kiryu: (Something's definitely bothering her…) Did something happen at school?

Izumi: ……

Kiryu: Come on, Izumi. You can tell me.

Izumi: …Hey, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: What's up?

Izumi: Is not having parents… a bad thing?

Kiryu: Huh?

Izumi: The other kids at school were making fun of me 'cause I don't have a mom and dad.

Kiryu: How'd that even get brought up?

Izumi: Well, Bring Your Parents to School Day is pretty soon, so everyone started asking what I was gonna do.

Kiryu: Uh-huh…

Izumi: They… They said my parents can't come 'cause they're dead.

Kiryu: (That's awful…)

Izumi: Everyone knows I live here with you, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: ……

Izumi: And it's not like I want you to pretend to be my dad or anything, but…

Kiryu: But what, Izumi? You can tell me.

Izumi: It's… really hard. Like, some of the other parents can't come 'cause they're too busy, but nobody makes fun of those kids. Why not!? Why can't I just have a real family like everyone else!?

Kiryu: You do have a family, Izumi.

Izumi: Huh?

Kiryu: Me, Haruka, and everyone else.

Izumi: I don't get it.

Kiryu: Listen. Families come in all shapes and sizes. Having a "real" mom and dad isn't what matters here.

Izumi: But…

Kiryu: What matters is that you're surrounded by people who love you for who you are.

Izumi: But we're not related.

Kiryu: Well, there's more to it than that. Related or not, you mean the world to all of us. That alone is enough to make us family.

Izumi: ……

Kiryu: And besides, I don't think your classmates were really making fun of you.

Izumi: Huh?

Kiryu: They've spent their whole lives with their moms and dads right by their side. They can't imagine it any other way. I'm sure they just don't realize how lonely life as an orphan can be.

Izumi: Then… they don't think I'm weird?

Kiryu: That's right. If anything, I'd say they were genuinely concerned about you feeling lonely.

Izumi: ……

Kiryu: I was an orphan, too. I know just how hard it can be. Even so, I’ll always think of the man who brought me up as my real dad. And the other kids from my orphanage? They're my siblings. Throughout all my time there… the idea of not having a real family never even crossed my mind.

Izumi: ……

Kiryu: So you see? You have everything you could ever need right here at Morning Glory. Your family's just as real as any of the other kids' at school. You don't need to be jealous of them.

Izumi: I'm not! It's just, they say things sometimes…

Kiryu: And when they do, you can tell them this. "I'm not alone. I have nine people in my family."

Izumi: Nine?

Kiryu: Me, Haruka, and the others. That makes nine.

Izumi: We're… a family, huh? (starts crying) Okay. I'm gonna keep trying.

Kiryu: Good. I know I’ll never replace your actual dad… But you've been like a daughter to me since the moment you walked in.

Izumi: Uncle Kaz!

[Haruka walks in.]

Haruka: Izumi-chan. Everyone's wondering where you've been. Let's go home, okay? There, there. No more tears.

Kiryu: Oh, and it's curry tonight. Hope you saved some room.

[They return to the house.]

Kiryu: (looking at the plates) You didn't eat?

Taichi: Of course not! Not without Izumi!

Short Haired Boy: Yeah, but now we're starving, so hurry up and sit down!

Girl with Pigtails: Let's go, Uncle Kaz!

Izumi: Okay!

Long Haired Boy: Let’s go, Uncle Kaz! We wanna eat!

Kiryu: Sorry. All right. Everyone ready?

Everyone: (cheerfully) Let's eat!

Girl with Pigtails: (to Izumi) Good, isn't it?

[Kiryu smiles. Everything’s going great.]

Six Months Later
March 2008

[Kiryu is chopping firewood in the yard. Haruka approaches him with papers in her hands.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz. We got another one.

Haruka: It says “eviction notice.” Are we getting kicked out? Those weird guys have been hanging out here a lot lately.

[Next to the orphanage there is a blue truck with two guys, a fat guy with blond hair and a skinny, muscular guy with a short haircut. Both are smiling like pedophiles.]

Haruka: Everyone's really scared…

Kiryu: I'll go see what's up.

[Kiryu goes to them. The idiots in the car get nervous and leave quickly.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz… We don't have to leave, do we?

Kiryu: Not if I can help it. I'm not about to let those guys kick us out of our home. They must be Ryudo Family boys. That's who's been sending us those letters. One way or another, it's gonna have to stop. I can't have them keep scaring you guys. Maybe I should pay this Ryudo Family a little visit.

Haruka: ……

Kiryu: Don't worry, Haruka. I'm not planning on getting into any fights, even if they are yakuza.

Haruka: Just… be careful, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: I will. Be back tonight.

Go to the Ryudo Family Office
[Kiryu goes to Downtown Ryukyu.]

Kiryu: (The Ryudo Family has gotta be somewhere around here. Guess I should start by looking for those guys from before. Pretty sure they were driving a little blue truck…)

[Soon Kiryu finds the truck and the idiots eating ice-cream near it.]

Short Haired Idiot: Ugh, this heat's a freakin' killer.

Kiryu: Hey there, punks.

Fat Idiot: (shocked) It’s him!

Short Haired Idiot: (threatening) Want something, old man?

Kiryu: You two are in the Ryudo Family, right?

Short Haired Idiot: So what if we are?

Kiryu: You boys make a habit of dishing out eviction notices to ordinary civilians?

Short Haired Idiot: "Civilian," huh? You're funny. Don't think I've ever seen a civilian with that kinda ink on his back.

Kiryu: Either way, you can't keep scaring my kids. I don't want to see your faces again.

Short Haired Idiot: (threatening) Listen here, man. Ain't nobody we hate more than arrogant outsiders like you. Now get the hell outta Okinawa.

Kiryu: …That's why you're trying to evict me?

Short Haired Idiot: Can't say. If you wanna know the truth… You'll have to ask our boss.

[Kiryu walks away.]

Short Haired Idiot: Just a sec there! Where do you think you're goin'?

Kiryu: To the Ryudo office. Could use a chat with this boss of yours.

Fat Idiot: (frightened, pulls out his phone) Aniki! We've gotta warn him!

Short Haired Idiot: (takes the phone from him) He doesn't have time to deal with petty shit like this.

Fat Idiot: (quietly) You’re right… (untranslated)

Short Haired Idiot: Our only job right now is keepin’ this guy in check. So sorry to say, I can't let you just stroll on over to our office. How do you think that'd make me look, huh?

Kiryu: Then what should I do?

Short Haired Idiot: If you really wanna see the boss… You're gonna have to beat me first!

Kiryu: Huh. Is that it?

Fat Idiot: (flashy) You don't know who you're messing with, old man! The captain's not gonna go easy on you!

Kiryu: Captain?

Fat Idiot: (flashy) You heard me! My aniki here is the captain of the Ryudo Family… The Fighting Viper Rikiya Shimabukuro-san! Now run while you still can, asshole!

Kiryu: Put a sock in it.

Fat Idiot: What was that!?

Kiryu: I can't imagine this makes your family look too good.

Fat Idiot: Don't try n' talk your way outta this, you fucking coward!

Kiryu: You might be a big shot down here in Okinawa… But if you think that'll scare me off, you're just a damn fool.

[Rikiya takes off his Hawaiian shirt in one swift motion.]

Rikiya: (to Fat Idiot) Hold this for me.

Fat Idiot: Of course. (untranslated)

[Rikiya  shows a snake in the grass on his back.]

Kiryu: Well?

Kiryu: Cute snake you've got there.

Rikiya: What did you say!? It’s not a snake! It's a goddamn viper! That's why they call me the Fighting Viper!

Kiryu: Doesn't matter to me what it is.

Rikiya: Well it should! This thing's the symbol of Okinawa! Got the heart and soul of this island right on my damn back.

Kiryu: Safe to say you like your hometown, then.

Rikiya: Damn right! And now I'm gonna show you just what Okinawa's all about. Mikio! Back off, this one's mine!

Mikio: Oh? Yeah… (untranslated)

Rikiya: Ready to rumble?

Kiryu: Ready when you are.

Rikiya: Then bring it!

[Rikiya appears to be a swift and agile opponent but Kiryu has a light years more experience and beat him quite easily.]

Mikio: Aniki!

Rikiya: Shit… The hell's he eat to get that strong?

Kiryu: Well? I may be mainland. And I may be old. But I still hit pretty hard, huh? Now that promise. I want you to take me to your boss.

Rikiya: …All right. A deal’s a deal. To the Ryudo office we go. C'mon, follow me. Mikio. Run on ahead and let the boss know we’re comin’.

Mikio: Got it, Aniki!

Kiryu: Hey, I wanted to ask you about that tattoo you have.

Rikiya: What about it?

Kiryu: You said the viper's the symbol of Okinawa, right? Then why’d you leave its eyes blank?

Rikiya: Oh well… My tattoo guy ended up passing away before he could get all the finishing touches in. So I decided to just leave it that way.

Kiryu: Can't you get someone else to finish the job?

Rikiya: I mean, I've thought about it and all… but I dunno if some random other artist could do his work justice. Wouldn't really feel right, y’know?

Kiryu: I guess.

Rikiya: And with how important the viper is, I gotta have someone who's real in-tune with the soul of Okinawa. Haven't found anyone like that since my old guy died, though.

Kiryu: Knowing Okinawa has nothing to do with it. The best tattoo artists know how to best reflect a man's soul, no matter the theme. A master artist should be able to do your viper justice.

Rikiya: Well then I hope I can find one someday.

Kiryu: The world's a big place. I'm sure you'll come across someone sooner or later.

Rikiya: Yeah, you might be right. Anyway, we should get movin’. The boss’ll be waiting for us.

[They turn off the main street into a long alleyway with many vendors.]

Cheerful Man: Oh, Rikiya! Where're you heading? You look like you're busting a dang gut over there, heh!

Rikiya: Just taking him to see the boss.

Cheerful Man: That guy? Wow, he's built! Makes you look like a little kid with those tiny arms of yours, Rikiya! Haha!

Rikiya: C'mon, man!

Cheerful Man: Hahaha, don't be like that. It was just a little joke. Hey, pal. You're not from around here, huh?

Kiryu: Nope, but I've been on the island for almost a year now.

Cheerful Man: Oooh, a convert! How're you liking Okinawa, friend? Probably never wanna step foot on the mainland again, huh? Hahaha!

Rikiya: Listen man, we're kinda in a hurry here, so…

Cheerful Man: All right, all right. Run along. Oh, and ask the boss if he wants to grab a drink tonight, will ya?

Rikiya: Sure. See you later.

[Kiryu and Rikiya continue towards the Ryudo Office.]

Chatty Old Woman: Riki-chan! Come say hello!

Rikiya: Sorry, I'm kinda in a hurry here.

Chatty Old Woman: (laughs) Says the guy who spends all his time sitting on his toosh! Hahaha! Gosh, that's too funny! You and Miki-chan spend more time lounging around getting fat than doing actual work, hahaha!

Rikiya: C'mon, not in front of the guest…

Chatty Old Woman: And what a guest he is! If only were twenty years younger and a couple inches taller! Mmmmmm!

Rikiya: Is that shit all you old ladies think about? Seriously, you're embarrassin' me here! Anyway, we really gotta get going.

Chatty Old Woman: One sec, Riki-chan! I just got some nice bitter melon in, so I'll whip up a big ol’ batch of goya champloo for you boys. Maybe I can bring it 'round the office later?

Rikiya: I can't hang with the bitter shit, you know that. Anyway, no time to be standing around! We gotta go!

Chatty Old Woman: Try bringin' that can-do attitude to your work, too! You and Miki-chan can't keep goofing off all day!

Rikiya: (to Kiryu) …Sorry, she's kinda nosy. This way.

Kiryu: (Seems like the locals are on pretty good terms with the Ryudo…)

[They approach the office. Mikio is standing outside.]

Rikiya: Hey there, Mikio. The boss inside?

Mikio: Yup, getting ready for our guest here.

Rikiya: Well, this is the Ryudo Family office. Come on in.

[Kiryu goes inside. We see a sign on the door. In small characters at the top it reads 有限会社 that means Limited Company or LLC. The large top to bottom text reads 名嘉原興業 that means NAKAHARA Corporation.]

Rikiya: (in polite pose) Right this way.

[Kiryu makes a few steps.]

Rikiya: (in polite pose) After you.

[Kiryu enters the main room, decorated with portraits of previous family bosses and a plaque and the character 仁 which means benevolence, humanity, virtue, charity.]

Rikiya: I'll go get the boss. It won't be a minute.

[Kiryu sits on the tatami and waits. She notices a girl drawing in her sketchbook. Soon an aging man in a white T-shirt and with a puffy mustache comes out to him.]

Moustached Man: Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting. So you're Kiryu-san. Hear you and Rikiya had a little scuffle.

Kiryu: There's something I want to ask you.

Moustached Man: Lemme guess, the eviction notices?

Kiryu: That's right. Why are you so intent on kicking us out? I need to know.

Moustached Man: (to drawing girl) Saki. Hey, Saki. We got grown-up stuff to talk about. Mind taking it to your room for a bit?

[She leaves. We learn the boss name - Nakahara.]

Kiryu: …Who's the girl?

Nakahara: My daughter. Name's Saki.

Kiryu: You have a daughter?

Nakahara: Not by blood. I took her in, oh… maybe three years ago now.

Kiryu: Huh.

Nakahara: Now about those eviction notices.

Kiryu: I'm listening.

Nakahara: I'm real sorry to be doing this to you, but I don't have a ton of choice in the matter.

Kiryu: And why's that?

Nakahara: Well, the family's owned the land you're sittin' on for decades now. We built the houses over there ourselves and have been subletting 'em since, but now a potential buyer's come knocking, and we're not planning on turning 'em down.

Kiryu: Someone wants the land?

Nakahara: Yup. Sounds like it's gonna be the site of some fancy schmancy new resort.

Kiryu: Hm…

Nakahara: What, you hadn't heard?

Kiryu: This is my first time, yeah.

Nakahara: Well, the word is they're gonna plop a big resort on the land your little neighborhood's on now. Either that, or use it for a brand new American military base. It’s been all over the news.

Kiryu: So that's why you're trying to evict us.

Nakahara: Yup. I've gotta admit my feelings are kinda mixed on the whole shebang, bein' Okinawa born and raised and all… but who am I to stand in the way of progress? So, what do you say? Think of it as a favor. Me and the rest of the Ryudo Family’ll really owe you one.

Kiryu: ……

Nakahara: Look, Rikiya told me about the orphanage. …Trust me, I know from Saki how hard raising kids that age can be.

Nakahara: But you mainlanders are practically made of money, right? Can't you just take your kids somewhere else? And if you really need some extra cash, we might be able to spot you a little somethin’. Well? Not a bad deal, huh?

Kiryu: I get where you're coming from.

Nakahara: Great. Then we'll just—

Kiryu: I'm not going.

Nakahara: Whaddya mean!?

Kiryu: Everything you said makes sense. But you know… Only a self-absorbed thug would think of it like that.

Nakahara: You watch your tongue.

Kiryu: …I was yakuza too, once. An expert at finding reasons to ruin other people's lives. If anything I was too good at it. But that's no excuse. Do you realize what would happen to those kids if you get your way? So listen close. As long as I'm around, my orphanage and everyone in it is staying put. Understand? We're done here.

Nakahara: Bullshit we are! Don't you walk away! I might be an old Okinawan fart… But I'm not gonna let some mainland punk talk to me like that. You get me?

[He grabs a katana and quickly unshelths it.]

Kiryu: Are you sure this is what you want?

Nakahara: Huh!?

Kiryu: If you kill me my kids will have nowhere to turn. So tell me. Will that satisfy you? Now if you really love Okinawa… You should do what you can to help the island instead of trying to evict innocent children. I'll fight you if need be… But you should know. I won't hold anything back.

[He leaves the office.]

Chapter 3: POWER STRUGGLE
[Kiryu watching a news report on TV in the orphanage.]

Reporter: On to our next story… A key figure in the liberal push for Okinawa military expansion, Defense Minister Ryuzo Tamiya, and the man in charge of the Okinawa resort deal currently underway, Land Minister Yoshinobu Suzuki, both paid a visit to the embattled region today. On one side is Tamiya-san, a proponent of the island's newly proposed BMD, or ballistic missile defense system. While on the other is Suzuki-san, who has long opposed expansion of American military presence on Okinawan shores. He suggests that the government instead focus its efforts on a new resort which will drive tourism to the region. Political and business leaders alike are paying close attention to just what these two men's visits will entail. Tamiya-san's journey got off to a rocky start as he was greeted at the airport by throngs of protesters. Carrying signs and handing out flyers opposing his proposed military expansion plans. Suzuki-san, on the other hand, was met by a faction of local businessmen and financiers, who proceeded to take him on a personal guided tour of the intended site for his forthcoming resort. The two proposals, Tamiya-san's military expansion deal and Suzuki-san's plan for a new resort, have been met with mixed opinions from the people of Okinawa. Needless to say… Both-ministers will need to compromise if they hope to accomplish their goals.

Suzuki: (on TV) Of course, it's clear that this BMD system is vital to ensuring Japan has a bright, stable future. But I won't let us keep forcing Okinawa to sacrifice its own well-being for the country's defense. My resort development plan will help promote tourism to the island and dramatically stimulate its economy thus creating new jobs and opportunities for the humble people of this beautiful land. I say, Okinawa first.

Tamiya: Defending our home is all that concerns me. I have nothing more to say on the matter.

Reporter: As opposed to the seemingly more receptive Suzuki-san… Tamiya-san departed the airport clearly uninterested in entertaining interviews. The unannounced nature of the two ministers' visits has fueled speculation that both men will attempt to… Push their respective proposals through the National Diet, at some point in the coming weeks and months. And what do the locals think of all this?

Woman: (on TV) We're crawling with American soldiers as is. But a resort? Now that's something I might be able to get behind.

Man: Even if someone does go and shoot missiles at us, I'd be willing to bet it'd be at Tokyo, not Okinawa. Guess I'm not surprised Tamiya-san's not really thinkin' about what's best for us, though.

Reporter: As aspiring prime minister candidates, both men are likely to be under intense scrutiny for some time now. In other news…

[Kiryu turns off the TV.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz… Is that why they keep trying to kick us out? You talked to those guys in the truck, right? How’d it go?

Kiryu: They wanted to buy us out, but I turned them down. Somehow I doubt that's the end of it, though.

Haruka: Oh… …Uncle Kaz? Are we gonna have to leave Okinawa?

Kiryu: Don't worry, Haruka. I'm not gonna let that happen.

Haruka: ……

Kiryu: Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

Haruka: Okay, I believe you. Oh, I almost forgot!

Kiryu: What's up?

Haruka: Well, it's probably nothing… but Shiro's been kinda down since he got home from school.

Kiryu: I wonder why. Did you ask him what was wrong?

Haruka: Yeah, but it didn't seem like he wanted to talk to me…

Kiryu: Hm, okay. I'll give it a shot. Thanks for letting me know. (Time to find Shiro.)

[He goes to the beach and finds Taichi and Short Haired Boy having fun fighting each other.]

Kiryu: Hey, is Shiro with you two?

Taichi: Hiyah! Taichi Bomb!

Mitsuo: Ow! Don't hit so hard, Taichi!

Taichi: Hehehe. There's more where that came from! Taichi Explosion!

Kiryu: I asked you a question, Taichi!

Taichi: C'mon, Uncle Kaz! Can't you see we're busy here?

Kiryu: Just take a break for one second. Do either of you know where Shiro is?

Taichi: Uhhhh, maybe in our room? We asked if he wanted to play with us but he said no. Tai…chi… Blast!

Mitsuo: Hey, no fair! I wasn't ready!

Kiryu: I'm glad you kids are full of energy. Just… Try not to get hurt, okay?

Taichi: We’ll be careful!

Mitsuo: You're never careful!

Kiryu: (Guess I'll take a look inside.)

[He finds Shiro in the house sitting on the floor and looking sad and depressed.]

Kiryu: Hey there, Shiro. Everything okay?

Shiro: …I’m fine.

Kiryu: You don't look fine. Everyone else is having fun outside, but you're sitting in here all by yourself. Are you sure you’re okay?

Shiro: Just leave me alone.

Kiryu: Did something happen at school?

Shiro: No…

Kiryu: Does this have to do with a girl?

Shiro: …What do you mean?

Kiryu: Well, you're at the age that boys start—

Shiro: That's not it! Just leave me alone, okay!?

Kiryu: (Guess I was wrong.)

Kiryu: Does your stomach hurt?

Shiro: Not really…

Kiryu: (Hm, doesn't look like he wants to talk. Maybe the other kids would know something.)
[He goes to the girls sitting at a table near the house.]

Kiryu: Ayako.

Ayako (Girl with Pigtails): What's up, Uncle Kaz? Is this about Shiro?

Kiryu: Yeah, something's definitely up. Do you know if he's having trouble at school?

Ayako: I'm not sure. We're not in the same grade… Have you heard anything, Izumi-chan?

Izumi: Ummm, nope. We're in different classes, so.

Ayako: Want me to try asking him?

Kiryu: Nah, it's okay. If he's gonna open up to anyone, it'd probably be another guy. I'll give it another shot.

Kiryu: Hey, something's up with Shiro. You two know if anything happened at school?

Koji (Long Haired Boy): I don't. We barely even see each other most days.

Kiryu: What about you, Riona?

Riona: Same. He's in a way lower grade than me, so our classes are really far away. Sorry.

Kiryu: It's all right.

Koji: Want me to figure out what's wrong, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: How are you gonna do that?

Koji: Easy, I'll just put him in a headlock! That'll get him talkin' in no time, haha!

Riona: Hey, that's a good idea! I bet I could take him, too.

Kiryu: Come on, you two. You should be looking out for Shiro, not trying to beat him up. That's what being an older sibling is all about. I thought you knew better.

Riona: ……

Koji: ……

Kiryu: Never mind, I’ll do it. And keep your hands to yourself, Koji. You're just gonna make things worse.

Koji: All right…

[Kiryu goes to the kitchen.]

Haruka: Oh, Uncle Kaz! Did you find Shiro?

Kiryu: Yeah, but he wasn't too keen on talking.

Haruka: I could've sworn he'd open up to you, though…

Kiryu: Me too. Guess I try talking to the others, see if anything's happened at school lately.

Haruka: Good idea. I'm sure someone knows something.

[Kiryu tries to talk to Shiro again.]

Kiryu: You sure you're feeling all right, Shiro?

Shiro: I said I'm fine.

Kiryu: You don't seem fine.

Shiro: Ugh, why don't you listen!? Just leave me alone!

Kiryu: ……

[He continues his little investigation.]

Ayako: Did Shiro tell you anything?

Kiryu: Not really, no.

Ayako: Oh. Sorry I can't be more help, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: It's all right, Ayako. I appreciate the effort.

Koji: I'm real sorry about what I said, Uncle Kaz.

Riona: Me too.

Kiryu: It's okay. Just remember we all need to stick together. Everyone here is part of the same family, okay?

Koji: Okay… Oh, and did Shiro say anything?

Kiryu: Not yet. I'm still trying to figure it all out.

[He goes to the beach.]

Kiryu: Taichi! Mitsuo!

Taichi: Not now, Uncle Kaz! I was just about to go in for the body slam!

Kiryu: Give the games a rest and listen.

Taichi: …All right. What's up?

Kiryu: It's about Shiro.

Taichi: Wait, he wasn't in our room?

Kiryu: He was, but he won't talk to me. He's just sitting curled up in the corner.

Taichi: Yeah… He's been doing that a lot lately.

Kiryu: What? Why?

Taichi: Probably 'cause he's been getting bullied.

Kiryu: Bullied? How do you know?

Taichi: I found him crying in the boy's room at school a couple weeks ago, so I asked him what was wrong.

Kiryu: And that's when he told you about the bullying?

Taichi: Yeah.

Kiryu: Hm…

Taichi: I think it's been getting worse, though.

Kiryu: What makes you say that?

Taichi: Well I thought it'd be funny to barge in on him when he was taking a bath… but he had bruises all over his body. And he doesn't do sports or nothing so he wouldn't have gotten ‘em from that.

Kiryu: Did you tell a teacher?

Taichi: Nuh-uh. The bullying always gets worse if you tattle. Besides…

Kiryu: I've heard enough. III talk to the teacher myself.

Taichi: Wait, Uncle Kaz! I dunno if that's such a good idea!

[But Kiryu is already calling.]

Hashimoto: Ryukyu Elementary, Hashimoto speaking.

Kiryu: Hi there, my name is Kiryu from Morning Glory, and—

Hashimoto: The orphanage, right? You must be the guardian for all those poor kids.

Kiryu: And who are you, exactly?

Hashimoto: Oh, just one of the teachers here at the school.

Kiryu: Perfect. I'm actually calling about one of my kids, Shiro. Could I speak with his teacher?

Hashimoto: That would be me. What seems to be the problem?

Kiryu: Well, I have reason to believe he's been getting bullied…

Hashimoto: Bullied? What evidence do you have of that, hm? Is this some kind of joke!?

Kiryu: Trust me, I'm not the joking type. Shiro's holed up in his room right now, not talking to anyone. Apparently there have been bruises on his body, too.

Hashimoto: I assure you, there is no chance such awful behavior would take place at our school! What about the other orphans? Who knows what those kids of yours get up to without parents around to keep them in check.

Kiryu: What did you say!?

Hashimoto: Honestly, I'm sick and tired of all these nervous parents whining to me about their children! Raising them is your responsibility, not mine! Though I suppose your case may be a lost cause. Goodbye, Kiryu-san. * beep * beep * beep *

Kiryu: What was his problem…?

Taichi: Uncle Kaz…

Kiryu: Don't worry, Taichi. I'm gonna make sure this never happens again.

Taichi: But…

Kiryu: It's okay. I get Shiro to talk.

[He returns to the house and walks to Shiro.]

Kiryu: Shiro…

Shiro: ……

Kiryu: I want you to tell me what happened.

Shiro: ……

Kiryu: You can trust me, Shiro.

Shiro: ……

Kiryu: Please. All I want is for you to be happy. You and everyone else here. I'm not gonna just stand around doing nothing when you’re so clearly in need of help.

Shiro: ……

Kiryu: Come on, just tell me what's going on. …Is someone bullying you?

[Shiro nods.]

Kiryu: All right. I'll go have a talk with your school.

Shiro: You can’t!

Kiryu: Why not? I already spoke to your teacher, but he wasn’t a whole lot of help.

Shiro: ……

Kiryu: Shiro… (Why doesn't Shiro want me going to his school? There has to be a reason. Hm. Maybe I could just cut out the middleman and talk to this bully's parents directly. Taichi seems to know a lot about what's been going on. He might be able to point me in the right direction.)

[He finds Taichi in the yard.]

Kiryu: Taichi.

Taichi: Oh, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: Don't tell anyone about this… but do you think you can find out who's been bullying Shiro for me?

Taichi: I already know. That's what I was trying to tell you before.

Kiryu: Who is it?

Taichi: Some kid named Yoshinori, but…

Kiryu: But what?

Taichi: …It's kinda complicated. Yoshinori's the son of Shiro's teacher, Hashimoto.

Kiryu: What!?

Haruka: Are you sure?

Taichi: Hashimoto would be in big trouble if he admitted his own son was a bully… so I dunno if he'll ever fess up.

Kiryu: Well now I really need to get involved. I'd better check with Shiro again to make sure.

Taichi: Uncle Kaz…

[Kiryu returns to Shiro.]

Kiryu: Shiro. Taichi told me all about what's been going on. Has the teacher's son really been bullying you?

Shiro: …Yeah.

Kiryu: Why didn't you tell me sooner?

Shiro: ……

Kiryu: Please, Shiro. I need you to talk to me.

Shiro: But Yoshinori… He said… He said his dad plays golf with Akasaka-sensei from the city council. That he'd get them to shut Morning Glory down if I tattled on him…

Kiryu: Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

[Shiro sobs.]

Kiryu: It's okay, Shiro. Don't cry.

Shiro: I'm not crying! I'm just… frustrated. Yoshinori only picks on kids when he knows they're not gonna fight back… it’s not right.

Kiryu: Don't worry, Morning Glory's not going anywhere.

Shiro: Huh…?

Kiryu: I promise. So the next time he tries to mess with you, I want you to stand up for yourself. You hear me?

Shiro: …Mhm.

The Next Day

Kiryu: (I figured out why Shiro's so down… but that's not enough. I've gotta fix this somehow.)

[He walks near his neighbor, Miyara.]

Miyara: Everything okay, Kiryu-san? You look kinda worried.

Kiryu: Hi there, Miyara-san. It turns out Shiro's been getting bullied at school.

Miyara: What!? Who would go after a sweet kid like Shiro-kun? I'd like to give them a piece of my mind!

Kiryu: Well, it's a kid named Yoshinori… but his dad's the real problem. Apparently he's pretty tight with Akasaka-sensei. Meaning if I don't go about this the right way, they'll get city council to come shut my orphanage down.

Miyara: Really? That doesn't seem like the Akasaka-san I know.

Kiryu: Wait, you know him?

Miyara: Of course. He's famous 'round these parts. Well, as famous as a city councilman can be. Anyway, he's definitely the honest type, not the kind of guy to use his position to settle grudges. Why don't you go talk to him? He loves chatting with his constituents, so I'm sure he'd be willing.

Kiryu: Even so, I can't just go marching into city hall over this. Maybe if there was somewhere else I could run into him…

Miyara: Oh, why don't you try the golf course?

Kiryu: …Why the golf course?

Miyara: That's where he spends most of his free time. They say he wouldn't be caught dead without his trusty set of clubs! Apparently he loves it so much he forgets to eat sometimes! But golf balls can't fill an empty stomach, you know?

Kiryu: Huh. I wonder how even he finds time to work.

Miyara: Second that, Kiryu-san. Anyway, the monorail's the best way there. Just get off at Golf Course Station and you're golden.

Kiryu: Thanks a ton, Miyara-san. Time to go find out if those rumors are true.

[Kiryu uses the monorail to get to the Nanyou Country Club.]

Kiryu: (Better go find Akasaka at the golf course…)

Receptionist: Welcome, sir. Are you a member of our club?

Kiryu: Well, no. I, uh…

Receptionist: Ah, so you're a visitor. Do you have a guest pass?

Kiryu: Uh…

Receptionist: My deepest apologies, sir, but this is a highly exclusive club for local businessmen and government officials only. If you don't have an invitation from a current member, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I’m very sorry, sir.

Kiryu: (Dammit. How am I ever gonna find Akasaka if I can't even get in the club?)

Stranger: If you'll allow me to intrude…

Kiryu: Hm?

Stranger: I hear you don't have a guest pass.

Kiryu: Yeah, I didn't realize this was a private club…

Stranger: In that case, why don't you join me for a couple of holes?

Kiryu: Really?

Stranger: I was actually meant to meet a friend here, but it seems he won't be showing up. I suppose he had some last-minute business to attend to. I'm not too fond of playing by myself, though, so if you wouldn't mind joining me, I'd be glad to have you along.

Kiryu: And… who are you exactly?

Stranger: Ah, where are my manners? My name is Akasaka.

Kiryu: You mean from the city council?

Akasaka: Ah, I take it you've heard of me. May I ask your name?

Kiryu: Ot’s Kiryu.

Akasaka: Well then, Kiryu-san. Shall we play?

Kiryu: Yeah, let's do it. (Talk about luck. This is the perfect chance for me to get closer to Akasaka.)

Akasaka: I'll take the first shot, if you don't mind.

Kiryu: Be my guest. Hey, you're pretty good.

Akasaka: I'm not sure I'd go that far. The wind's just been blowing in my favor today, that's all. Do you golf often, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Not really, no.

Akasaka: Ah. Well, practice makes perfect.

Kiryu: Right.

[They make a few shots.]

Akasaka: Wow, Kiryu-san! Your form is fantastic!

Kiryu: Me? I don’t think so.

Akasaka: Haha, no need to be modest. You're a natural. Shall we head to the next hole?

Kiryu: Sounds good.

Akasaka: Say, what sort of work do you do, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: I run an orphanage called Morning Glory.

Akasaka: Wow. Taking care of all those children is quite a task.

Kiryu: It's not easy, sure… but nothing makes me happier than seeing them smile.

Akasaka: Haha, that's wonderful. I'm glad to know you enjoy your work, Kiryu-san… and what vital work it is. Now let's get this hole started.

[A few shots later…]

Akasaka: Speaking of the orphanage, Kiryu-san. How many kids do you have there?

Kiryu: Nine, all in elementary school.

Akasaka: And you take care of them all by yourself? Do you have any helpers?

Kiryu: No, but the oldest girl, Haruka, takes on a lot of that responsibility. She'll be starting sixth grade next month. And the chores are divided up between all the kids. Everyone has to help out.

Akasaka: How wonderful. Too many kids these days sit around watching TV while their parents do all the work. Now, shall we head to the next hole? As a professional, Kiryu-san, what are your the youth of today?

Kiryu: Well, things were definitely different when I was a kid. But with how drastically the world has changed, I guess that's not too much of a surprise. I’d say the real problem is that we spoon-feed everything to kids nowadays. There's no room for imagination anymore. Back in my day, we'd come up with games we could all play together when we were bored. And since we had lots of kids of different ages, we had to make rules that were fair to everyone. We didn't want to exclude anyone just because of their age or ability. It was through those playground games that we first learned about cooperation, and what it means to help others. These days, though… It's all about video games and the internet. From what I hear most kids would rather stay in their rooms than go outside to play.

Akasaka: True, we didn't have any of those luxuries when we were young. Children nowadays certainly have it good… but in a way, I feel sorry for them. Bullying seems to have grown more prevalent as well. I will admit, it's always been present… but incidents appear to be even more malicious recently. Perhaps the children of today lack basic consideration for their fellow students…

Kiryu: Looks like it, yeah.

[A few shots later…]

Akasaka: Kiryu-san, I have another question about your children, if you don't mind. How do they spend their free time?

Kiryu: Well we don't have a computer or any games, so for the most part they all play together outside. All the older kids really look after the younger ones, too. It's like we're one big family.

Akasaka: That sounds lovely. Would it be all right if I paid you a visit sometime?

Kiryu: Of course, I’d be glad to have you.

[The match ends. Kiryu wins.]

Akasaka: I have to thank you for the match, Kiryu-san. Golf isn't much without an enjoyable conversation to go with it. I hope I have the chance to stop by your orphanage sometime soon. And I mean that sincerely.

Kiryu: We'd love to have you.

Akasaka: Perhaps there's even some way the city could support all the charitable work you do for those children. If you ever need anything, please feel free to give me a call, I'll do everything within my power to help you.

Kiryu: I appreciate that, Akasaka-san.

Akasaka: Farewell, now.

Kiryu: See you later.

Akasaka: Ah, and before I forget. I signed you up on my permanent guest list, so you'll be free to visit the club whenever you please. Perhaps we'll even play again some time.

Kiryu: I hope so. (Akasaka had nothing but nice things to say about Morning Glory. I bet that'll make Shiro feel better.)

[He gets back to the orphanage and surprisingly finds Akasaka near the entrance.]

Kiryu: Oh, Akasaka-san.

Akasaka: Good to see you again, Kiryu-san. I told you I'd stop by, didn’t I?

Kiryu: Yeah, though I wasn't expecting it to be so soon…

Akasaka: Hahaha! Once an idea crosses my mind, I simply have to see it through as soon as possible!

[The children go back from school.]

Taichi: (running in) Taichi in the house!

Koji: (running in) Yo, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Hey, you forgot to say hello to our guest! And take your shoes off before you go inside!

Eri (Ugly Girl): Hi, Uncle Kaz!

Izumi: We’re home!

Kiryu: You two have a good day at school?

Eri: Mhm! Oh, a guest! (bows) Hi, Mister!

Izumi: (bows) Hi!

Akasaka: Haha. Hello there, kids.

Eri: Come on, Izumi-chan!

Izumi: Okay!

[They run away to the house.]

Akasaka: Hahaha! Such energetic kids.

[Shiro runs in. His face is covered with bruises.]

Shiro: I’m home!

Kiryu: Looks like things didn’t turn out so well.

Shiro: Yeah, but I’ll get him next time!

Akasaka: (laughs) That's the spirit, young man!

Shiro: Huh? Who's he?

Kiryu: A guest. Go on and introduce yourself.

Shiro: Nice to meet you, Mister. I'm Shiro.

Akasaka: It's a pleasure to meet you, too. Your manners are impeccable.

Irritated Voice: Hey, you! Are you Kiryu!?

[Hashimoto walks in with his kid. ]

Hashimoto: What kind of parenting are you doing over here!? Look what your kid did to this poor boy! What were you thinking!?

Akasaka: Oh, Hashimoto-san. Good to see you.

Hashimoto: (shocked) Akasaka-sensei!? What are you doing here?

Akasaka: Truthfully, I've been wanting to pay this orphanage a visit for some time now. So of course, I didn't waste any time when Kiryu-san here invited me. I needed to see the children he clearly loves so much for myself. They'll certainly grow into fine young adults. Is it the environment? Or perhaps Kiryu-san's guiding hand? What’s your secret?

Kiryu: Honestly, I can't take that much credit. They're all really independent. I only step in when absolutely necessary.

Akasaka: I see. You should take a page out of his book, Hashimoto.

Hashimoto: Yes, sir. I agree.

Yoshinori: Hey, what about Shiro!? He thinks he's better than all us regular kids 'cause he doesn't have parents!

Akasaka: Don't speak to him like that, young man! He didn't choose to be an orphan. None of these kids did. If you were really his friend, you would help him solve his problems, not make them worse.

Yoshinori: Whatever, you old fart! (runs away)

Akasaka: Well I never! I feel sorry for that boy's parents. Though I'm sure being his teacher is hard enough, Hashimoto-sensei.

Hashimoto: Well… I should be going. (leaves)

Akasaka: I must say, Kiryu-san, it warms my heart to see how happy and healthy your children are. You have the full support of the city. I assure you.

[Akasaka leaves. Kiryu and Shiro happily look at each other. Some time later Haruka runs in.]

Haruka: Hi, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Hey, Haruka. How was school?

Haruka: Good! Are the others back already?

Kiryu: Yeah, they got home a while ago.

Haruka: Shiro, too? I hope he's okay…

Kiryu: Don't worry, Haruka. Shiro's gonna be just fine.

Haruka: Really? That's a relief! I was so worried when I heard he was getting bullied… But I'm glad everything's gonna be okay!

Kiryu: Me too.

Haruka: Well, I better go get dinner started!

Kiryu: Be careful with the knives!

[He walks toward the house and hears a commotion in the next room.]

Taichi: C’mon, gimme it back!

Ayako: I will, just… not yet. Sorry, Taichi.

Kiryu: (Sounds like Taichi and Ayako are up in arms over something. I better go take a look.)

[He overhears the conversion.]

Taichi: Just gimme my money back!

Ayako: I… don't have it right now. Can you wait until I get my allowance?

Taichi: But that's not 'til next week, and the new Ninja Rangers manga comes out today! All the kids at school are gonna read it before me!

Ayako: I’m sorry, Taichi..

Taichi : Ugh, whatever! You better pay me back soon, liarface! (runs out of the room)

[Kiryu walks to Ayako.]

Kiryu: Why didn't you pay Taichi back, Ayako? Did you lose the money? Or accidentally spend it?

Ayaki: Um…

Kiryu: Come on, this isn't like you. When you borrow something from someone, you have to make sure you give it back.

Ayaki: But… I, um…

Kiryu: Don't be afraid. You can tell me.

Ayako: …Someone stole it.

Kiryu: What!? One of the other kids? Are you sure? Maybe it just fell out of your pocket.

Ayako: No, I keep all my money in my wallet inside my bag.

Kiryu: (So whoever stole it would have to know it was there.)

Ayako: ……

Kiryu: All right. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

Ayaki: No!

Kiryu: Ayako. We have to find out what happened.

Ayaki: But…

Kiryu: I go round up the others. Wait for me in the dining room.

Ayako: Okay…

[Kiryu walks to Eri and Izumi.]

Kiryu: Hey, can you two go to the dining room for me?

Izumi: What's wrong, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Nothing really, we just need to have a family discussion about something.

Izumi: Oh, okay!

Eri: Did something happen?

Kiryu: I'll tell you later. See you girls in the dining room.

Eri: Okay.

[Kiryu goes to Koji, Shiro and Mitsuo (Short Haired Boy) playing on the beach.]

Koji: Oh, Uncle Kaz. What's up?

Kiryu: Can you three go and wait for me in the dining room?

Mitsuo: Isn't it kinda early for dinner…?

Kiryu: We're gonna have a house meeting.

Shiro: Why? What happened?

Kiryu: You’ll know soon enough. Just go wait for me, okay?

Koji: All right. Cmon.

[Kiryu finds Taichi.]

Kiryu: Taichi.

Taichi: Uncle Kaz, you gotta help! I gave Ayako some money, but she's not giving it back!

Kiryu: I know. I heard you two arguing earlier.

Taichi: Then why won't you do something!?

Kiryu: I am. Go wait in the dining room. All of us are gonna have a talk about what's going on here.

Taichi: Whaddya mean?

Kiryu: It looks like someone stole the money from Ayako.

Taichi: Huh? Like, someone here!?

Kiryu: I'm not sure yet. That's why I want to have this meeting. Just wait for me in the dining room, okay?

Taichi: Yeah, okay…

[Kiryu goes to the kitchen to get Haruka.]

Haruka: Where have you been, Uncle Kaz? We're supposed to be getting dinner ready!

Kiryu: Looks like dinner's gonna have to wait.

Haruka: Huh? Why?

Kiryu: Ayako's money has gone missing.

Haruka: Huh? Do you think someone stole it?

Kiryu: Sounds like it. One day it was in her wallet, the next it was gone.

Haruka: That's awful…

Kiryu: Anyway, we're gonna meet in the dining room. I want you there, too.

Haruka: All right.

[Next Kiryu gets Ayako.]

Kiryu: Get on over to the dining room.

Ayako: ……

Kiryu: Ayako?

Ayako: …Okay.

[And finally he finds Riona.]

Riona: What's up, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: There's something we need to talk about. Wait for me in the dining room, okay?

Riona: Okey-dokey.

Kiryu: (Well, that's everyone. Time to find out what happened.)

[They have a meeting in the dining room.]

Kiryu: …And that's pretty much all we know. Ayako's really worried, and rightfully so. The money got taken right out of her wallet, after all. Now, I don't like doing this any more than you do… but if one of you stole the money, I need you to speak up.

[The kids stay silent and look at Kiryu.]

Kiryu: Ayako. When did you first notice it was gone?

Kiryu: All right, then. Did any of you notice anything?

Ayako: Umm, I think it was two days ago.

Kiryu: All right, then. Did any of you notice anything weird going on? Were there any strangers hanging around or anything?

Koji: Uh… I think I saw something. Riona was digging around in Ayako's bag.

Kiryu: Riona?

Riona: Ayako-chan said I could borrow her paint, so I was getting it out of her bag! You don't think I stole the money… do you, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Of course not.

Riona: Now that I think about it, didn't Mitsuo just buy a new model set? It's a pretty fancy one, too. Kinda suspicious timing, don't you think?

Kiryu: Well, Mitsuo? How did you get the money for something like that?

Mitsuo: Huh? I saved up for weeks, that's how! I didn't do anything wrong, Uncle Kaz! I even stopped buying snacks so I could save up quicker!

Kiryu: ……

Mitsuo: Besides, don't they say the first guy to speak up is usually the one who did it!?

Koji: What was that!?

Mitsuo: You heard me!

Haruka: Stop it, you two!

[Ayako starts crying.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz… What do we do?

Kiryu: All right, we're done here. This was clearly a mistake.

Everyone: ……

Shiro: But somebody stole the money, right!?

Taichi: Yeah, he's right!

Kiryu: Look, we're not gonna keep sitting here flinging accusations at each other. That's not what being a family is about. But I'll say it again. If one of you did take the money, you can come talk to me whenever you want. I won’t tell the others.

[The meeting is over.]

Kiryu: (The only thing that accomplished was making everyone doubt each other. Although… we'd be missing a lot more than Ayako's money if the thief had come from outside. So as much as I hate to admit it, one of the kids must have stolen it. Guess the only option now is looking through their things.)

[He looks around the house and sees Eri doing something with Ayako's bag. He stops her.]

Kiryu: What were you doing in here, Eri?

Eri: Um, nothing…

Kiryu: That's Ayako's bag, right? You know you can't dig around in there without her permission.

Eri: ……

Kiryu: Come on, just tell me what you were doing.

Eri: ……

Kiryu: Or is there a reason you don't want to say?

Eri: You're wrong!

[She runs away. Ayako enters.]

Ayako: Uncle Kaz… What's wrong with Eri?

Kiryu: I found her looking through your bag.

Ayako: Huh?

[She runs to her back and checks the content.]

Ayako: Oh!

Kiryu: Is something else missing?

Ayako: Nuh-uh. Actually… the money's back in my wallet.

Kiryu: What?

Ayako: Eri…

[Kiryu finds Eri on the beach.]

Kiryu: All right, Eri. It's time you told me what's going on.

Eri: I'm sorry, Uncle Kaz…! I'm really, really sorry!

Kiryu: So it was you.

Eri: I promised my friends I’d go to the movies with them, but I didn't have any money…

Kiryu: Then why'd you promise?

Eri: I never get to do stuff with them… They have real parents, so they get way more allowance than I do. And you have nine of us to take care of, so I can't ask for more… My friends know I can't afford a lot, so they never ask me to do stuff with them. So when they asked me to go to the movies… I was really happy. (cries) I couldn't say no to that, so I just… took the money. I was gonna give it back next time I got my allowance, I swear! But… I’m sorry, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: I'm glad you were planning to pay her back, but you can't borrow something that's not yours without asking first. That's stealing.

Eri: I know…

Kiryu: But you gave the money back. And now you've confessed, too. That's really brave of you.

Eri: ……

Kiryu: The next step now is apologizing to Ayako. Think you can do that for me, Eri?

Eri: But… I made everyone so mad. Nobody's gonna forgive me… Especially not Ayako.

[Ayako approaches them.]

Ayako: Eri-chan.

Kiryu: Go on. Show me how brave you can be.

Eri: Ayako-chan, I…

Ayako: It's okay. And… I'm sorry, too.

Eri: Huh? Why are you apologizing, Ayako-chan?

Ayako: To be honest… I saw you take the money from my bag. Eri-chan I knew it was you.

Eri: Huh!?

Ayako: I couldn't bring myself to stop you. Even though it was the right thing to do. And now seeing what you're going through, I really wish I had. If only I could take it back.

[Eri cries and hugs Ayako.]

Ayako: I'm supposed to be your sister, but I wasn't brave enough to stop you. If I just had a little courage, none of this would ever have happened. So… I'm sorry. Will you ever forgive me?

Eri: (crying) I'm sorry, too! I'm so sorry!

Kiryu: Come on, you two. Let's get back inside.

Eri: ……

Ayako: ……

Kiryu: Huh? What's wrong?

Eri: ……

Ayako: Everyone's so angry… I wonder what they're gonna do when they find out Eri took the money. I mean, Koji and Riona are already fighting… What do we do, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Hm…

Eri: Everyone's gonna hate me…

Kiryu: Nobody's going to hate anyone. I'll tell you what, leave the talking to me. What I need you two to do is… (whispers his plan) Got it?

Ayako: Mhm.

Eri: I'm so sorry, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: Come on, let's get everyone in the dining room.

Ayako: Okay, I’ll go round them up.

Eri: Me too!

[Kiryu returns to the dining room for another meeting.]

Kiryu: Listen up. We got Ayako's money back.

Taichi: Really!?

Koji: Then you know who the thief is!

Kiryu: Not so fast. I actually have to apologize to all of you.

Riona: Huh?

Shiro: Why?

Kiryu: Well, Eri came to me yesterday saying she found some money, but I guess it slipped my mind today.

Mitsuo: Seriously, Eri? Where'd you find it?

Eri: Um, in the yard…

Kiryu: And how much was it?

Eri: 1,000 yen.

Kiryu: Which is exactly how much you were missing, right, Ayako?

Ayako: Yeah.

Kiryu: Meaning there's a good chance the money Eri found yesterday is the same money that went missing from Ayako’s bag. There's no other possibility! Don't you guys think?

Taichi: Hmmm, I guess…

Riona: Sounds about right to me.

Mitsuo: So then nobody stole the money! Why was I getting blamed for it!?

Kiryu: I'm sorry, Mitsuo. All of this could have been avoided if I had just remembered sooner. Everyone. I'm really sorry.

Koji: Sorry's not good enough!

Riona: Yeah, I got called a thief!

Mitsuo: Yeah, me too!

Haruka: Hold on, guys..

Ayako: Wait. I'm the one who dropped the money, so if you're gonna get mad at anyone… get mad at me.

Eri: I… I should've said something sooner, too. I'm really sorry, everyone.

Haruka: See? Uncle Kaz was just a little forgetful! I think we should be glad none of us turned out to be thieves!

Koji: Yeah, I guess… Sorry, Riona.

Riona: Don't worry about it. And I'm sorry for suspecting you, Mitsuo.

Mitsuo: Eh, whatever! I probably deserved it for how I treated Koji…

Koji: Hey, it's all in the past now.

[Ayako and Eri smile at each other mischievously.]

Taichi: I'm just glad I got my money back! Though now I'm realizing… I'm starving! When's dinner, Uncle Kaz!?

Izumi: I wanna eat, too!

Shiro: Me three!

Haruka: Oh yeah! We totally forgot about dinner!

Kiryu: Right. Let's get moving.

Taichi: And make it snappy, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Heh, try not to eat the table while we're gone. Actually, why don't you all go play outside while we cook? Well come get you when it's ready.

Kids: Okay!

Kiryu: (to Haruka) Well, guess we better get started.

Haruka: Right!

[As soon as Kiryu walks into the kitchen Taichi runs to him.]

Taichi: Uncle Kaz, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: What's wrong, Taichi?

Taichi: It's that guy with the curly hair! I just saw him again!

Kiryu: Are you sure?

Taichi: Yeah, he's in that blue truck, probably spying on us again! It's definitely him!

Kiryu: All right, I’ll handle it. Make sure everyone gets inside.

Taichi: Okay!

Kiryu: (to Haruka) I'm gonna go take a look outside. Think you can handle dinner while I'm gone, Haruka?

Haruka: Of course. Be careful, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: I'll be fine, don't worry. But if I'm not back in time for dinner, you guys can start without me.

Haruka: Okay.

[He looks around and goes to the beach but can’t find Rikiya.]

Kiryu: (I don't see him anywhere… Maybe Taichi was wrong?)

[Re returns to the house and hears a voice from the yard…]

Rikiya: Hey, uh…!

Kiryu: Back again? My answer is final.

Rikiya: That's not why I'm here.

Kiryu: Hm? Then what is it?

Rikiya: Well, Aniki… I kinda need to ask you a favor.

Kiryu: What kind of favor are we talking?

Rikiya: It's gotta do with the little lady.

Kiryu: You mean the girl with the sketchbook?

Rikiya: That's right. Two nights ago, she just… disappeared. Nobody knows where she could’ve gone.

Kiryu: You think she ran away?

Rikiya: Dunno. We got men searchin' the streets and all, but they haven't found so much as a trace of her yet.

Kiryu: And have you gone to the police?

Rikiya: Well, not exactly…

Kiryu: Why not? You should file a missing persons report.

Rikiya: I dunno that we really can.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Rikiya: Well the truth of it is… she's the daughter of a guy the boss used to do business with. Now the boss is taking care of the girl, yeah. But he never officially adopted her. If the cops found out about that, they'd ship her back to her parents no questions asked.

Kiryu: And we don't want that?

Rikiya: Right. Saki-san's parents are real scum o' the earth, lemme tell you. Her dad gambled all their money away and then some, then would come home stinkin' of booze and beat the girl and her mom. Her mom, on the other hand, was always sleeping around. Acted like she didn't want a damn thing to do with her.

Kiryu: So then Nakahara took Saki in to protect her.

Rikiya: Yup. Three years back, we got asked to collect on her dad’s gamblin’ debt. So the boss went over to their house. But when he walked inside…

Kiryu: What happened?

Rikiya: He found the guy dead, hangin' blue-faced from a rope in their living room. Saki-san still clutching his lifeless leg.

Kiryu: …And her mom?

Rikiya: Probably off with one of her fuck boys. Lady never gave a single shit about Saki-san.

Kiryu: Which is why Nakahara took her in.

Rikiya: Yup. The boss looks scary, sure… but he's got a good heart. It just wasn't in him to leave Saki-san like that. And yeah he complained at first about how much trouble it was raising a kid, but it wasn't long 'til he ended up a proud father. Now he treats Saki-chan like she's his own flesh n’ blood.

Kiryu: That's amazing.

Rikiya: Yup, but word has it her mom's back in town. That she wants to take Saki-san back.

Kiryu: Why now, after all this time?

Rikiya: Beats me. Probably so she can have a maid to do all the housework while she goes out and parties. Anyway, the boss has been tryin' to keep the little lady in the office so her mom wouldn't be able to find her.

Kiryu: Which is why she was there when I stopped by.

Rikiya: Yup. And now that she's missin', the boss is real worried.

Kiryu: Saki's not a child anymore, though. Couldn't she just call him if she needed to?

Rikiya: Call him? Not a chance in hell!

Kiryu: …Why not?

Rikiya: The girl's mute!

Kiryu: What!?

Rikiya: The doctor said it's some kinda mental block, probably from watching her dad hang himself right in front of her. So you see, she can't call us!

Rikiya: C'mon, Aniki! We gotta find her as soon as possible! Please!

Kiryu: All right. What do you need me to do?

Rikiya: Well… with Saki-san gone and all, the boss is kinda losin' it. So we need some help pulling him back. Talk some sense into him, Aniki.

Kiryu: Why me?

Rikiya: The boss took a shine to you the moment you stepped foot in our office. You're the only one he'll listen to, Aniki!

Kiryu: Stop right there.

Rikiya: …Yeah?

Kiryu: What are you getting at here? It's all "aniki" this and "aniki" that.

Rikiya: I mean… It's 'cause you're my aniki. Duh.

Kiryu: You're the captain of the Ryudo Family. I'm nothing to you, especially not your aniki.

Rikiya: Eh, let's talk about this later.

Kiryu: No. I can't have a yakuza talking to me like that. What would my kids think?

Rikiya: C'mon, just let it slide! respect your strength, that's all! Don't you see? You're my aniki. Aniki! Anyway, I'm gonna go pull the car around! See ya soon, Aniki! (runs away)

[Kiryu sighs and follows him to the city.]

Rikiya: We're gonna have to walk from here, Aniki.

Kiryu: (I don't remember agreeing to this… Well, I've come this far. Might as well see it through.)

Rikiya: Let's get movin', Aniki!

Kiryu: All right, all right.

[They go to the Ryudo Family Office. When they go inside, they find Mikio with a black eye.]

Mikio: Oh, Cap! Kiryu-aniki!

Rikiya: Where's the boss? Inside. Got all sauced up on awamori, so he's not in the best of moods…

[Kiryu walks in the main room. There are things scattered all over the place. In the middle of the room sits Nakahara, with several empty sake bottles lying beside him.]

Nakahara: God dammit! The hell'm I gonna do? Oh! Well if it ain't Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: Hey there. You're not looking so hot.

Nakahara: Whaddya want this time? Sorry, but I'm not in the mood to talk about your little land problem.

Kiryu: Rikiya told me what's going on with Saki.

Nakahara: Ugh, that's Rikiya for ya. Never knows when to keep his damn mouth shut. This ain't your problem, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: Why don't you go look for her?

Nakahara: Can't. Wouldn't be so miserable if it was that easy.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Nakahara: She ran away 'cause she didn't wanna live with me anymore. I'd just scare her off if I went hunting for her now.

Kiryu: You don't know that for sure. Why don't you try to figure out why she really ran away? It wouldn't be too late to catch up to her if you go now. Rikiya told me Saki's mom has been out looking for her recently. Maybe Saki just wanted to see her again after all this time.

Nakahara: Same difference. Either she wants to be with her mom, or she doesn’t wanna be with me. God dammit! Am I really worse than that miserable whore!?

Kiryu: Nakahara…

Nakahara: Guess a yakuza like me doesn't have any business talking in a kid in the first place, huh?

Kiryu: That's not true. All children need is someone who really, truly cares about them. It doesn't matter what you do for a living.

Nakahara: The hell do you know? You think you're some kinda kid expert just 'cause you run a fucking orphanage!?

Kiryu: I know enough. I was an orphan myself.

Nakahara: Huh!?

Kiryu: Not only that, the man who raised me was the yakuza.

Nakahara: ……

Kiryu: And since I have no memories of my birth parents, that man is more of a father than I've ever had. He might have been a yakuza, yeah… but I loved him all the same. And I'm sure Saki loves you, too. But it's natural for her to miss her mom. She's still just a kid, after all.

Nakahara: You… You really think?

Kiryu: Of course. Now get out there and find her before someone else does.

Nakahara: But…

Kiryu: ……

Nakahara: I can’t.

Kiryu: Why not?

Nakahara: Look at me, Kiryu-san. Why would Saki ever wanna come back to this mess after seeing her mother? A thug like me could never compare to an actual parent parent. I'm just gonna have to face the facts. Saki's gone.

Kiryu: You really think so?

Nakahara: Yeah… I do.

Kiryu: ……Fine then. I'll go talk to Saki myself.

Nakahara: Huh? The hell’re you doin'!?

Kiryu: The same thing you did three years ago. She needs help now more than ever, and I'm not about to let her down.

Nakahara: Hold on there! If you think this'll change my mind about the land…

Kiryu: Don't worry. I just want to get Saki home safe. The land has nothing to do with it. That's a conversation for another time. Saki's the only thing I'm thinking about right now.

Nakahara: (shocked) You…

Kiryu: And I'll be borrowing one of your boys. Let's go, Rikiya.

Rikiya: Coming, Aniki!

Find Saki
[They leave the office.]

Rikiya: (bows) Thanks for talkin' to him, Aniki. But if we're really gonna look for Saki… I don't have the slimmest idea of where to start.

Kiryu: Then we'll just have to ask around. We can focus on the area right around the office for now.

Rikiya: But we already combed every last nook n' cranny! …Nobody's seen her.

Kiryu: And you don't know where her mom lives?

Rikiya: Nope, sorry to say.

Kiryu: Is there anywhere you haven't looked?

Rikiya: Nowhere she'd be likely to turn up. Only stone left unturned is Hatsumachi…

Kiryu: Hatsumachi? Why haven't you checked there?

Rikiya: Place is the biggest red light district on the island. Chock full o' hostess clubs, brothels… All sorts of smut a kid's not gonna go anywhere near. Besides…

Kiryu: What?

Rikiya: It's Tamashiro Family turf. Things'd get real hairy real fast if we showed our faces over there.

Kiryu: Then it's settled. We're going to Hatsumachi.

Rikiya: But Aniki, I just told you! Hatsumachi's—

Kiryu: The only place you haven't looked. I don't care whose turf it is. We’re going. Well? You're welcome to stay behind if you think the Tamashiro are really that scary.

Rikiya: Like hell that's gonna happen! I'm comin', Aniki!

Kiryu: Good. Now let's go.

Rikiya: All right!

[Het go to Hatsumichi street. An old woman from before runs to them.]

Worried Old Woman: Rikiya! Oh, thank god it's you! Something terrible's happened!

Rikiya: All right, all right. Calm down and tell me what's going on.

Worried Old Woman: It's Saki-chan!

Rikiya: Huh? What about her!?

Worried Old Woman: I… I saw her in Hatsumachi with some woman I've never seen before! Somethin' felt real of about the whole thing.

Kiryu: And you're sure it was her?

Charmed Old Woman: Oh, well if it isn't the dashing young fella from before. This must be fate!

Rikiya: C'mon, we don't got time for your hopeless flirtin’! Let’s try and focus!

Kiryu: Where did you see Saki?

Worried Old Woman: Coming outta the convenience store over at the intersection. With some woman who was absolutely dressed to the nines. I wonder who she was…

Kiryu: Maybe Saki's mother.

Rikiya: Then… you really think she went back?

Kiryu: Hard to say. The only way to know for sure is to find her and ask.

Rikiya: …I guess.

Chatty Old Woman: By the way, Rikiya. You gonna have a party tonight?

Rikiya: A party? Aw, shit! It's the boss's birthday! I've been so distracted, it totally slipped my mind! He's not gonna be in any mood for celebration if we can’t find Saki, though…

Kiryu: Then we're not doing ourselves any favors by standing around. Come on, let's go.

Rikiya: Right. We gotta bring her back, even if it’s just for today. Let's move, Aniki!

[They go to Hatsumachi street and hear a shout.]

Man's Voice: You there! In the kitschy shirt!

Kiryu: Hm?

Rikiya: Oh shit…

Kiryu: Who are you?

Aggressive Man: Me? Who the fuck are you!? Don't tell me you didn't know you're waddling all over Tamashiro Family territory right now.

Kiryu: Tamashiro? Sorry, never heard of 'em. I usually try to keep my nose out of yakuza business.

Tamashiro Thug: Bullshit! It's clear as the damn Okinawa sky what you do for a living!

Kiryu: I'm telling the truth. And even if I was a yakuza, I'm not here looking for trouble. Now suggest you leave us alone. Or else.

Tamashiro Thug: Wait, is that Rikiya back there? Your little game of hide and seek's not gonna work on me, Ryudo asshole!

Rikiya: Aw, shit…

Tamashiro Thug: I knew it! Not yakuza, my ass! If you weren't yakuza, you wouldn't be spendin' your time with this Ryudo sap! You here to try and take the brat back!?

Kiryu: Hm? What brat?

Tamashiro Thug: I don't got time for the twenty questions, bitch. C'mon boys, let's show them what we do to trespassers!

[Kiryu and Rikiya beat their asses to the ground.]

Tamashiro Thug: Shit… This guy really eats his spinach, huh?

Kiryu: So, you ready to talk now? Tell me about this "brat" you mentioned.

Tamashiro Thug: Urgh…

Rikiya: You listenin', punk!? Open your mouth or I'll open it for you! Now did kidnap Saki or not? Huh!?

Tamashiro Thug: Look, we didn't take nobody! Some bitch claimin' to be the girl's mother brought her in!

Kiryu: What could her mom possibly have to do with the Tamashiro…?

Tamashiro Thug: Duh, the tramp's sleepin' with the boss! Probably doesn't realize she's just another notch on the bedpost for him.

Kiryu: In other words, you have no reason to keep Saki. Give her back.

Tamashiro Thug: Look, we don't have her in a cage or nothin! She and her mom could be anywhere!

Kiryu: Hm, I think there's more to this than you're letting on Maybe we should go pay your boss a little visit. Rikiya. Where's the Tamashiro office?

Rikiya: Are you outta your mind, Aniki!? We can't go in there just the two of us!

Tamashiro Thug: Heh, your boy's right. They're gonna tear you limb from limb in there… but if you really wanna die, I'll tell you! It's on the street behind the convenience store.

Kiryu: You heard the man, Rikiya. Come on.

Rikiya: But Aniki…

[They find the place. Above the entrance there’s a sing that reads 株式会社 玉城商事 which is roughly means Tamashiro Co., Ltd.]

Kiryu: Looks like this is the place.

Rikiya: I mean, yeah… but we're not really gonna walk in there by ourselves, are we? They'll pulverize us!

Kiryu: What, you scared?

Rikiya: Me? I'm not scared of a damn thing! I'd put my life on the line if you asked me to,Aniki!

Kiryu: Wait, that's… Saki's sketchbook. This drawing is…!

Rikiya: Somethin' wrong, Aniki?

Kiryu: We're definitely on the right track, Rikiya. Saki has to be here.

Rikiya: I knew it!

Kiryu: I want you to go get Nakahara and tell him we found her. And bring him back with you!

Rikiya: Um… okay! What about you, Aniki?

Kiryu: Just go! I'll keep an eye on things here.

Rikiya: Okay! Be back in a jiff!

[He runs away and Kiryu, of course, walks to the office.]

Kiryu: Well, time to head in.

[Some fat guy in nerdy shirt crashes into him.]

Kiryu: Oof!

Fidgety Man: (bows) Oh, I'm sorry!

Kiryu: Another one of Tamashiro's grunts, huh? Do I need to teach you a lesson, too?

Fidgety Man: Wait, please. Just look at me! Do I seem like a yakuza to you?

Kiryu: You have a point. But you do look familiar… Anyway, if you're not with the Tamashiro, what are you doing walking into their office?

Fidgety Man: Well I have a, uh… deal to make with them. You know how it is. I mean, you're obviously yakuza.

Kiryu: Not anymore, I'm not. I'm just here to take care of some business.

Fidgety Man: Oh… Well, I'm Kamiyama. What's your name?

Kiryu: It’s Kiryu.

Kamiyama: Kiryu-san… Why does it feel like I know that name? Anyway, I deal in certain… choice items. They've been in high demand lately, if I do say so myself. It sounds like the Tamashiro are going to war soon, so they asked me to bring some of my stuff over.

Kiryu: And let me guess, by “stuff” you mean weapons?

Kamiyama: You don't have to scream! The whole town's gonna hear! But… if you're gonna go toe-to-toe with the Tamashiro, I might be able to lend a hand, if you catch my drift.

Kiryu: I thought they were one of your customers.

Kamiyama: Well yeah, but they're one of those customers you wish you could get rid of, but can't because they pay your rent. Though if you started buying from me and wiped them out, I could finally be free from their clutches!

Kiryu: Hold on a second. I never said a word about wiping anyone out.

Kamiyama: No need to be coy about it. I've been in this business for a looong time. Ripped guys like you are the brawling type. It's obvious. You've probably been in more fights than I can count.

Kiryu: ……

Kamiyama: Either way, wouldn't you rather have a weapon on you when you bust in there? Better that than going in empty-handed!

Kiryu: I guess.

Kamiyama: Then it's settled. I know the perfect store that can get you just the fix you need.

[He nods at a van, parked nearby.]

Kamiyama: That's it there.

Kiryu: …Not much for appearances.

Kamiyama: Don't worry about that. Just come with me. This is the only shop in town that sells the kinda underhanded stuff you're looking for. This guy here is an associate of mine.

Kiryu: It's, uh… Hm. Quite a setup.

Kamiyama: Hey, don't knock mobility! Anything that can help you get away from the fuzz is a positive in my book.

Kiryu: … Right. I take it this is your store, then?

Kamiyama: Oh, heavens no. This one's all handled by my pal here. My own shop is up on the second floor of a building near the Ryudo office. That's where I sell gear, and mod stuff, too.

Kiryu: Near the Ryudo office, huh..?

Kamiyama: I wish I could just give you everything you need to crush the Tamashiro… but remember I'm running a business here. Let me see… Here, this should get your engine started.

[He gave Kiryu an Extendable Staff!]

Kiryu: This should come in handy. Thanks, Kamiyama.

Kamiyama: (laughs) Oh, it's no problem at all. That's one of our most popular items. Ah, and remember that weapons will break as you use them. If that ever happens, just bring it up to my shop and I’ll fix it up for you in no time flat. Though don't expect me to work for free…

Kiryu: Free or not, that's a pretty good deal.

Kiryu: By the way, you guys have a lot of weapons I've never even seen before. It's incredible.

Kamiyama: Oh, have our wares caught your eye? I know a guy who can teach you how to use them if you want.

Kiryu: A weapons expert, huh?

Kamiyama: Yes, yes. I'll mention you to him. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to have a student as beefy as you… Oh, and just holler if you need anything else. I'll help you as much as I humanly can. After all, the Tamashiro'll come for my legs, maybe more, if you fail…

Kiryu: Let's hope I don't fail then.

Kamiyama: Yeah. Feel free to stop by my shop when you have the time!

Kiryu: I will. Thanks. Kamiyama.

[Kiryu walks in the Tamashiro Office.]

Thug: Huh? Who's this asshole? You lost, little Ryudo boy?

Kiryu: Where's Saki?

Thug: (laughs) You mean the brat? She's up with the boss. Sorry. But the only way you're gettin' up there… (mockingly) Is in a body bag!

[The thugs laugh nastily.]

Kiryu: I don't have time for this. Let me through.

Thugs: Well someone's got balls. Go on, boys! Tear him a new one!

[Kiryu takes out Kamiyama's staff and goes floor by floor, turning Tamashiro's goons into battered meat. Soon he finds Tamishiro's own office… Kiryu kicks in the door and sees Saki, her whore of a mother and the head of the family - Tetsuo Tamashiro in a flashy red suit.]

Kiryu: Saki…

Tamashiro: So the Ryudo's got some new muscle. And he crushed my boys all by himself. Color me impressed.

Kiryu: I'm not Ryudo Family. I'm just here for the girl.

Tamashiro: (smirks) Not sure I get how that's possible. Nakahara's the only one who'd lift a finger for this brat.

Kiryu: It doesn't matter who asked me to come. One way or another, you're giving me the girl.

Tamashiro: Like hell I am! You think I'd let my one bargaining chip walk that easy?

Kiryu: …Bargaining chip?

Tamashiro: (laughs) You don't know a damn thing, huh? You're more naive than you look.

[Saki’s mother holds Saki and prevents her attempts to run to Kiryu.]

Tamashiro: Shame what this sweet little girl's had to go through. (grabs Saki’s chin) First she watches her dad hang himself… Now her own mother kidnaps her for some bullshit "love." (quiet laughs) What's this world coming to?

Saki’s Mother: What do you mean? Our love is the real deal! You said the three of us would be a family!

Tamashiro: Me, shack up with an old slut like you? You outta your fucking mind!?

[He slaps her so hard he falls on the floor.]

Tamashiro: I got everything I need from you, hag.

Saki’s Mother: )crawl to him) You're not serious… right? It was a joke, right!? Say something! Tell me this isn't happening!

Tamashiro: (slashes her with one of his knives) Get your… filthy hands… off of me!

[Saki’s Mother turns over and threateningly looks at Tamashiro. He laughs.]

Tamashiro: Shame. You could've used the facelift. (to Kiryu) Don't think I forgot about you. Once I kill you… Nakahara's gonna get a nice package. Full of your fingers.

[He licks his knife.]

Kiryu: Well this is a disappointment.

Tamashiro: Oh?

Kiryu: I'm not a fan of raising my fists to lowlifes like you.

Tamashiro: Yeah, real fucking saint you are.

Kiryu: But there's one thing I like even less. The thought of letting you go.

Tamashiro: Huh!?

Kiryu: Now come get some!

[A fierce fight with the head of the Tamashiro family begins. He is quite fast and throws his knives. When Kiryu manages to land a few strong blows on him Tamashiro becomes enraged and starts fighting at full strength, but still loses.]

Tamashiro: The hell… Is a guy like you… Doin' in Okinawa?

[He loses consciousness on the floor. Nakahara and Rikiya burst in the room.]

Rikiya: You all right, Aniki? Saki!

Nakahara: Saki…

[Saki’s glad to see him…]

Kiryu: Nakahara-san here… He's been worried sick since you disappeared. He was convinced you ran off so you could live with your mom. He was miserable. So now you have a choice, Saki. Nakahara or your mom?

[Saki’s Mother burst in laughing.]

Saki’s Mother: I don't want her. Just like she doesn't want me. You're all a bunch of fucking morons!

[Nakahara: What!? (untranslated)]

Saki’s Mother: Don't you get it? This little bitch ruined my life! From the moment she was born, everything was about her!

Rikiya: How selfish do you have to be to say that to your own kid!?

[They struggle a bit but Saki’s Mother throws Rikiya on the floor…]

Saki’s Mother: I’ll say what I want! Don't touch me! If you want her weighing you down that bad, just fucking take her!

[This nasty drunk piece of human creature leaves the room.]

Nakahara: Some mother you are. Saying all that in front of your kid… Saki's gonna have it rough with her.

Kiryu: Saki'll be just fine. You’ve never looked in her sketchbook, have you?

Nakahara: No.

Kiryu: Then open it.

[He opens the sketchbook and finds a drawing of his face with some words…]

Nakahara: "Thank you for protecting me."

Kiryu: Well? There's your answer. Saki… She's your daughter now. Isn't that right, Saki?

Nakahara: (with eyes full of tears) Saki… (hugs her) Oh, Saki! Thank you… Thank you so much…! Saki… Saki! (cries)

[They go back to Ryudo Family Office. Nakahara bows to Kiryu in the most polite way - to the floor.]

Nakahara: I mean it! I can't thank you enough for what you did for me! I've been on this yakuza scene near 40 years now… and never once have I met a man like you!

Kiryu: That's enough.

Nakahara: Oh, no! I'm not done yet! After what happened tonight, I want you to be my sworn brother.

Kiryu: What?

[Rikiya and Mikio enter with two bottles of sake.]

Rikiya: Coming through.

Kiryu: What are you guys up to?

Nakahara: Be my brother, Kiryu. Please! I won't take no for an answer! Now let's swear this oath.

Kiryu: Hold on a second. I left the yakuza life behind.

Nakahara: Who gives a damn! I wanna do this as a show of respect. That's all I need.

Kiryu: Kinda selfish, don't you think?

Nakahara: We don't have a witness or anything, but this'll do. Now please!

[He with Rikiya and Mikio bows to the floor. Suddenly a voice is coming out of the next room.]

Familiar Voice: If it's a witness you need, I'd be glad to oblige.

[Daigo with some guy enters.]

Kiryu: Daigo.

Daigo: It's been a while, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: What are you doing down here?

Daigo: Looking into a family matter regarding the land for the Okinawa resort deal.

Kiryu: You're involved in this resort business?

Daigo: In a way. To be more specific, the ones responsible for the situation I'm confronted with… Are a small Okinawa-based offshoot of the Tojo clan.

Nakahara: What? That piece of the Tojo you're talkin' about… Is it the Tamashiro?

Daigo: That's right. The Tamashiro Family was originally founded to give us a foothold on the island. But now they've gone behind our backs and started buying up the land here for use in the resort deal.

Kiryu: What do the Tamashiro stand to gain from that?

Daigo: As it turns out… Minister Suzuki, of the resort program, asked them to scoop up every patch of crucial real estate in his stead. After all, his plan can't move forward without a certain amount of land to build on.

Nakahara: So that's what they're up to.

Daigo: Yes. In order to get the land he required, Suzuki-san needed a local organization on his side. And the Tamashiro Family just so happened to fit the bill.

Kiryu: I see. But that doesn't explain why you came here yourself, Daigo.

Daigo: It seems the Tamashiro are using some questionable methods to get a hold of the land. In some cases, they've even resorted to stealing the deeds from their rightful owners.

Nakahara: Is that why they abducted my Saki? To trade her for some scrap of paper?

Daigo: Most likely, yes. They knew how much you cared for the girl, and intended to use that affection against you.

Nakahara: Those Tamashiro assholes… Not a shred of humanity, the lot of 'em.

Daigo: Allowing them to keep employing those tactics would only lead to trouble. Imagine the scandal if the public knew yakuza were involved in the resort deal. Both it and the proposed military expansion would find themselves at extreme risk. Tamiya-san from the Ministry of Defense personally requested that I intervene.

Kiryu: Interesting.

Daigo: The truth of it is, the resort deal and the proposed military base are a linked pair.

Nakahara: Meaning what?

Daigo: You can't have one without the other. If one fails, both fail. Were the resort to be canceled, for example, only the base would remain. But public opinion would never support it on its own. In that sense, the resort's success is just as vital to Tamiya-san as that of his own bill.

Kiryu: I see. And that's why Tamiya sent you down here. He needs you to keep things from boiling over.

Daigo: Yes. This particular visit was requested by Toma-kun here. He asked that I accompany Tamiya-san.

Toma: I'm Minister Tamiya's personal secretary, Shoyo Toma.

Nakahara: Kid like you workin' for the Minister of Defense? That's some impressive shit.

Toma: Not at all. I'm merely tasked with carrying out the Minister's orders.

Kiryu: Hold on. If you stop the Tamashiro from buying the land, they'd have nowhere to build the resort. Not to mention Tamiya's military base.

Toma: Indeed. We hope to attain the land through negotiation with the locals, not threats.

Kiryu: Why do all this for just one bill?

Toma: This base would be a major international success, far outweighing some trivial little resort.A triumph befitting of the next prime minister.

Nakahara: So it's all politics.

Daigo: As for the Tojo Clan, we usually stay out of the business of our families. But were this to become a scandal, it would attract unwanted police attention. We absolutely can't allow that to happen. Hence why I'm here now.

Kiryu: So that's what's going on.

Daigo: But I had no idea your orphanage was being threatened, Kiryu-san. It came as quite a shock.

Nakahara: Guess that means you're not gonna have to part with your land. That's a win in my book.

Kiryu: I suppose.

Toma: That may be true for the moment, but your time is not infinite. I will do whatever it takes to ensure this resort deal meets with success.

Nakahara: Whaddya mean? I thought you were in Tamiya's corner. Shouldn't you be worrying about the base?

Toma: I'm an Okinawa native, myself… so it pains me to see my beloved home slowly fade into obscurity. If we fail to bring in the resources this resort promises, our island will die a prolonged, agonizing death. I may work under Minister Tamiya, yes, but I'll do what I must to support my people.

Nakahara: Toma-san, was it?

Toma: That's correct.

Nakahara: If you're really a local, you should know people don't want your damn resort. I used to think it wouldn't be so bad if it was bringing in the cash… But I was dead wrong. What people here really care about is keepin' the Okinawa they love just the way it is.

Toma: As if that matters in Tokyo. To them we're nothing more than an insignificant speck of earth. But I'll do whatever it takes to change that. Even if it means making sacrifices.

Nakahara: Sacrifices like our land, I guess.

Toma: Correct. Okinawa is famous for its abundant beaches. There should be no harm in laying claim to a few acres of that abundance.

Nakahara: So the ends justify the means, huh? Spoken like a true politician. But y'know… People might not be as willing to budge as you hope.

[Toma stay silent.]

Daigo: In any case, hope we can move on from this matter both quickly and peaceably. (bows) We should be going, Toma-kun.

Toma: Yes.

Kiryu: Daigo.

Daigo: What is it?

Kiryu: If the Tojo Clan ever does decide to come for my land… Just give me a heads up first, okay? Those kids depend on me as they would their actual father.

Daigo: I understand. But you needn't worry. As long as I'm chairman, the Tojo will stay far away from Okinawa.

Kiryu: You promise?

Daigo: Of course. I'm well aware of how resilient you are, Kiryu-san. Incurring your wrath would likely be the last thing I did. Toma-kun's dream for Okinawa can wait until he himself becomes prime minister. Right, Toma-kun?

[Toma stay silent.]

Daigo: You'll be an old man by then, Kiryu-san. And those children of yours will be about the same age I am now. Maybe then things will be different.

Kiryu: I still won't be a pushover.

Daigo: I expect not. Until next time, Fourth Chairman. (bows)

Kiryu: Yeah.

[Toma bows too. They both leave.]

Nakahara: Mind if I ask you somethin?

Kiryu: Hm? What's up?

Nakahara: By, uh… By fourth chairman… He didn't mean of the Tojo Clan… Did he?

Kiryu: And if he did?

Nakahara: You're shittin' me! Everyone who's anyone's heard the legends of the fourth chairman! The Dragon of Dojima, right? Then you're… Kiryu!?

Kiryu: Next time you pick a fight… You might wanna do a little more research first, brother.

Nakahara: Look at me, swearin' an oath with the biggest fish in the yakuza sea.

Kiryu: Guess you never know what life’ll throw at you.

[Kiryu drinks sake and wrinkles his nose - the drink is quite strong.]

Chapter 4: THE MAN IN THE SKETCH
[The scene changes to the beginning of the game. Hospital. Kiryu, Rikiya, Mikio, Haruka and Saki are waiting for the end of Nakahara's operation, who has been shot… by Kazama.]

One Year Later
March 2009

[Kiryu phone’s ringing.]

Kiryu: Yes?

Kashiwagi: Kiryu. It's me. Kashiwagi.

Kiryu: Sorry, Kashiwagi-san. I'm actually at a hospital right now. Mind if I call you back later?

Kashiwagi: Kiryu. The sixth chairman's been shot.

Kiryu: What? Daigo!? Tell me everything.

Kashiwagi: It happened about an hour ago in his office. I'm not sure of the specifics. All we know for certain is that the man who shot him was the splitting image of Patriarch Kazama.

Kiryu: Kazama-san!?

Kashiwagi: So I hear. I'll let you know if I learn anything more. Goodbye, Kiryu.

[He hangs up. Kiryu stays in shock for a while.]

Rikiya: What's going on, Aniki.

Kiryu: From the sounds of it… The Tojo Clans sixth chairman-has been shot.

Rikiya: Hold on a sec. When you and the boss swore your oath a year ago… The sixth chairman was the witness, right?

Kiryu: (picks up Saki’s sketchbook) And the one who shot Daigo… It was him.

Rikiya: It was him. The man in the drawing.

Kiryu: Yup. Looks like it was.

[The sign 手術中 (Surgery in progress) turns off and the doctor comes out of the operation room.]

Rikiya: Doc! How's the boss!?

Doctor: We've done all we can to stabilize his condition. The next week or so will be critical.

Mikio: Is he gonna make it!?

Doctor: It's hard to say with absolute certainty. He was shot three times at point-blank range, after all. Luckily, the bullets all appear to have narrowly missed the vital organs. That is certainly something to be thankful for.

Rikiya: What're the odds he'll pull through, Doc? You gotta tell me.

Doctor: At the moment, I'd say around fifty-fifty.

Mikio: Oh…

Doctor: But remember, he managed to call an ambulance entirely on his own despite having been shot multiple times. I don't think he's ready to leave you all just yet. And we'll do everything we can to make sure he doesn't.

Rikiya: Thank you so much, Doc!

[Next scene. Night. Kiryu sits on the beach near the orphanage. Haruka walks in.]

Kiryu: Where are the others?

Haruka: They all went to bed. Uncle Kaz…

Kiryu: What’s up, Haruka?

Haruka: Are you… gonna go back to Kamurocho?

Kiryu: I don’t know if I am.

Haruka: Huh? Why not?

Kiryu: I have a life here now. Responsibilities. I don't have time to go running off to Tokyo at the drop of a hat.

Haruka: But if you don't… we're gonna lose the orphanage, right?

Kiryu: It’s hard to say. Though one thing's for sure: whoever shot Nakahara was after the deed for our land.

Haruka: ……

Rikiya: Aniki!

Kiryu: Rikiya? Little late for a house call, don't you think?

Rikiya: Sorry, but I've got a favor to ask.

Kiryu: What is it?

Rikiya: Well, uh… I wanna go to Kamurocho with you!

Kiryu: Huh?

Rikiya: I know you're gonna try and get the deed back, Aniki! Which means findin' the guy who shot the boss! Please, you've gotta take me with you!

Kiryu: Rikiya…

Rikiya: Oh, and Mikio can stick around the hospital while we're gone. He's on board if it means us gettin' payback for what that asshole did to the boss!

Kiryu: And Saki? What happens to her?

Rikiya: Er…

Kiryu: Look, I'm glad you want revenge for your boss. But who's gonna be there to look after Saki if you're not around?

Haruka: Well, uh… I could do it.

Kiryu: Huh?

Haruka: Saki-chan can stay with us at the orphanage.

Kiryu: It’s not gonna be easy, you know.

Haruka: I know. But she's probably been really lonely with her dad in the hospital and everything. Maybe it'll be good for her to spend time with other kids for once.

Rikiya: Haruka-chan…

Haruka: I'm sure the others would love to have a new friend to play with, too.

Kiryu: But…

Haruka: Please, Uncle Kaz. I've trusted you all these years. This time I need you to trust me. We'll take good care of her. Really.

Kiryu: Haruka…

Rikiya: Aniki, I… I promise I won't get in your way or anythin’. Just please… I'm beggin' you. Lemme tag along! (bows)

Kiryu: …All right.

Rikiya: Aniki! You won't regret it, I promise! (bows again)

Kiryu: We leave Okinawa tomorrow night. Head back to the office and pack your things.

Rikiya: Okay!

[He bows and runs away.]

Kiryu: Haruka. Take care of Rikiya for me. I can't take him, not now. Kamurocho's too dangerous. This burden is mine alone to bear.

Haruka: Uncle Kaz… It's getting kinda chilly. Let's go in, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: I actually think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.

Haruka: Oh, okay. See you inside!

Kiryu: Don't forget to wipe your feet off before you go in!

[She runs away. Kiryu stroll around a little and get back to the house and find Haruka near the entrance.]

Kiryu: What's wrong, Haruka? Can’t sleep?

Haruka: Yeah, I guess there's a lot on my mind. But you don't need to wait for me. Uncle Kaz. You have a big trip tomorrow. 

I have some things to do first.
True. I should probably hit the hay. ✓

Kiryu: Fair enough. I should probably hit the hay. Don't stay up too late, all right?

Haruka: I won't! Sweet dreams, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: Sweet dreams, Haruka.

THE NEXT MORNING

[Mikio and the kids are chasing a dog in the backyard.]

Mikio: C'mere, you mutt! Come to Papa Mikio! I got you now!

[Kiryu and Izumi approach them.]

Izumi: Ah!

Mikio: You're gonna get it this time, you stupid mutt!

Kiryu: Izumi. This dog a friend of yours?

Izumi: (scared by the dog) Ahhh!

Kiryu: Get back!

[The dog runs away.]

Izumi: Wait!

Taichi: (runs after the dog) Come back!

Koji: (runs after the dog) You're not getting away that easy!

Mikio: Oh, shit! I know where that dog's from!

Kiryu: Language, Mikio. Now tell me about this dog.

Mikio: Well, he used to live over at an Izakaya in Hatsumachi. Quiet little fella back then. Not the maniac he is now. Honestly, he's so outta his mind I didn't even recognize him at first. But he's definitely the same dog. The guy who ran that place shipped on up to Tokyo a while ago, though. Guess he just abandoned the dog… Hey, didn't you used to have a pupper, Izumi-chan?

Izumi: Yeah… Can I go look for the dog, Uncle Kaz? Please!

Kiryu: Just wait. I'm sure he'll come back eventually.

Izumi: No, I'm gonna go find him!

Kiryu: …All right. You want a hand?

Izumi: Yes please!

[Taichi and Koji return.]

Mikio: No luck, boys?

Taichi: Naw, he got away… That's the fastest dog I've seen!

Koji: You're just slow, Taichi! I totally could've him!

Taichi: Oh yeah? Then why didn't you?

Kiryu: That's enough, you two. Where'd the dog go?

Koji: He sprinted off toward town.

Kiryu: Well, looks like we're going on a little field trip then.

Izumi: Okay!

Taichi: You're really gonna go after it?

Kiryu: Yup. You two want to join?

Taichi: Nah, I'm pooped.

Koji: Me too. I'm sick of chasing dogs!

Izumi: I’m coming!

Mikio: How 'bout me and Izumi go take a peek over on Ryukyu Boulevard? You can check out Hatsumachi, sir.

Kiryu: Sounds good.

Mikio: C’mon, Izumi!

Izumi: Coming!

[They go to town. Kiryu follows them. On his way out of the orphanage, he sees Mitsuo talking to a man in a straw hat.]

Mitsuo: I told you we don't want any ice cream! Uncle Kaz is gonna say the same thing!

Man Wearing Straw Hat: Dammit, kid, you're not listenin' to the words comin' out of my mouth! I need to see a guy named Kazuma Kiryu.

Kiryu: What's going on here?

Man Wearing Straw Hat: Wait… Are you Kazuma Kiryu?

Kiryu: Yeah. What do you want with one of my kids? I don't appreciate people pressuring them to buy ice cream.

Man Wearing Straw Hat: Kazuma Kiryu! I have come for you! Yeah, thať's right. I know you know Kamiyama. I trained Kamiyama in the use of a bunch of the weapons he carries. I'm kind of a master at 'em. A weapons master, you might say. Kamiyama told me all about how you were lookin' for new and exciting ways to bust skulls, so here I am.

Kiryu: Why would a master come all this way at the request of his pupil?

Yonashiro: Okay, okay, you're a little suspicious. Understandable. But I'm not a rich dude. I spend most of my time selling ice cream on the beach. Kamiyama is my pupil, but he also sells me weapons at a discount 'cause I'm such a great guy. And because I'm such a great guy, I can't refuse him when he asks me to do something.

Kiryu: (So this is Kamiyama's weapons master? Maybe I should have him teach me.)

Learn From Him ✓
Maybe Later

Kiryu: Okay, I'll take you up on that.

Yonashiro: Yesss! I was worried you were gonna chicken out. Come find me on the beach. If you're man enough, that is.

Kiryu: Got it. I'll see you down there.

[But first, Kiryu decides to find the dog. He goes out into the city and begins his search. After fighting with several thugs and yakuza, she finds the dog in a back alley.]

Kiryu: (There it is!)

Energetic Dog: Grr!

Kiryu: Don't worry, boy. I'm not gonna hurt you.

[The dog runs away.]

Kiryu: Hey, get back here!

[He chases the pup.]

Catch That Dog!
[Kiryu catches the dog.]

Kiryu: You sure can run. It's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you. Come here, boy.

Scared Dog: Grrrr!

[Mikio and Izumi run in.]

Mikio: Oh, sir! You cornered him!

Kiryu: Yup. Only took running half a marathon to do it…

Mikio: Wow, sir! That's incredible!

Kiryu: He's still scared, though.

Scared Dog: Grr… Bark, bark!

Izumi: Uncle Kaz, Uncle Kaz! Can we keep him?

Mikio: Whaddya mean, keep him? The thing's terrified of you guys. Can't see why you'd want him, anyway.

Izumi: Well I do want him! Because… Because.

Kiryu: What is it, Izumi?

Izumi: (cries) Because he looks like Mame! 

Mikio: …Mame?

Izumi: That's the dog my mommy and daddy got for me when I was born.

Mikio: Izumi-chan… They might look the same, but this dog here’s not your Mame.

Izumi: I know he's not. I had to give Mame away when mommy and daddy died.

Kiryu: Izumi…

Izumi: But when this doggy showed up near our house, I though for a sec that Mame came to see me.

Mikio: Izumi-chan…

Izumi: So can we keep him, Uncle Kaz? Please!

Kiryu: …Okay, but only if you train him to not be so crazy.

Izumi: Deal!

Mikio: Come on, Izumi-chan. That dog's never gonna be normal. Look.

Scared Dog: Grrrrrrr… Bark, bark bark!

Izumi: But…

Kiryu: It's okay, Izumi. Everyone's afraid of new things, dogs and people alike. But if you show him you're scared, he'll be scared, too. So you just have to put on a brave face. Understand?

Izumi: Mhm!

Mikio: Well? How're you gonna tame him, Izumi-chan?

Izumi: I'm just gonna keep trying 'til he's used to me!

Mikio: Trying… what?

Izumi: Uncle Kaz, what do dogs like to eat?

Kiryu: Oh, that's an easy one.

Dog food, obviously
Hamburgers, believe it or not
Maybe milk?
Definitely bones! ✓

Kiryu: Definitely bones!

Izumi: Bones?

Izumi: Bones? Seriously, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Of course. All the dogs in cartoons love them, so a real dog would probably think the same way.

Izumi: Okay! Can you go get one?

Kiryu: …Why do I have to go?

Izumi: So I can stay here with the puppy. I think he likes me! Please, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: I don't even know if they sell bones around here…

Izumi: But it was your idea! Come onnn!

Kiryu: … All right, I’ll be back in a minute. Keep an eye on Izumi for me, Mikio.

Mikio: Yes, sir!

Kiryu: (I should've just kept my big mouth shut. Where am I supposed to find a bone around here anyway? Guess I could always check the stores.)

[He goes to the nearby M-Store.]

Employee: Welcome.

Kiryu: Hey, I'm looking for a bone.

Employee: …A specific bone, sir?

Kiryu: Any bone would work, really.

Employee: And… canl ask why?

Kiryu: It's for a dog, Obviously.

Employee: Either way, sir, I'm afraid we don't carry bones here.

Kiryu: Well, thanks for hearing me out, at least.

[Kiryu leaves the store and goes to the nearest bar, where he gets drunk on the grief of his hopeless situation. After that, he goes around a few more stores, but there are no bones on sale anywhere.]

Kiryu: (This is a lost cause. I better go tell Izumi.)

[He gets back to Mikio and Izumi.]

Kiryu: Izumi…

Izumi: Oh, Uncle Kaz! Did you get that bone?

Kiryu: About that. I looked all over, but I couldn't actually get my hands on one. Sorry.

Izumi: (with a grumpy look) Hmph.

Mikio: ……

Kiryu: Should I, uh… go get something else?

Izumi: I don't care!

Kiryu: (She doesn't seem very happy…)

Izumi: Uncle Kaz, do you know what kinda toys dogs like?

Kiryu: Toys, huh? Hm…

A ball would be good. ✓
Cat toys, believe it or not.
Maybe a stuffed animal?
Definitely bones!

Kiryu: A ball would be good. Something to play fetch with, you know?

Izumi: That's kinda boring… but okay. Can you go get one? 

Kiryu: …Me again?

Izumi: I can't go now, I think he's starting to get used to me! Please, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: …All right, I'll be back in a minute. Keep an eye on Izumi for me, Mikio.

Mikio: Will do.

Kiryu: (Now to find a ball. I think I've seen Koji practicing baseball with one…)

[He gets back to the orphanage.]

Kiryu: Koji. You use a rubber ball for baseball practice, right?

Koji: Yup! Why do you ask?

Kiryu: Mind if I borrow it for a bit?

Koji: What, you gonna play some baseball, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Uh, not exactly.

Koji: …Well, all right. Just remember to give it back!

Kiryu: I will.

Koji: And you're buying me a new one if you lose it!

Kiryu: Deal. Though I'm not sure you'll want this one back…

Koji: Huh? Eh, whatever. Here!

[Kiryu borrowed the Rubber Ball.]

Kiryu: Thanks, Koji. Stay out of trouble while I'm gone.

[He gets back to Mikio and Izumi.]

Kiryu: Got it, Izumi.

Izumi: Yay! Thanks, Uncle Kaz!

[Kiryu handed over the Rubber Ball.]

Izumi: Look, doggy! A nice ball! Why doesn't he wanna play…?

Kiryu: Hm, I could've sworn that would work. Aren't dogs supposed to like ditching balls?

Mikio: He's probably still spooked.

Izumi: Hmmm, what else would a dog want?

Mikio: Cmon, Izumi-chan. Let's throw in the towel.

Kiryu: How long are you gonna keep at this?

Izumi: As long as it takes! I'm not leaving until he comes home!

Kiryu: …Guess we'll have to figure something out, then.

Mikio: Why don't you take a stroll, sir? Clear your head, y'know? I won't let Izumi-chan outta my sight while you’re gone.

Kiryu: Yeah, that's not a bad idea. I'll be back in a bit.

[He leaves for a snack.]

Kiryu: (I'm kinda worried about Izumi and Mikio… I should probably go check on them.)

[Meanwhile…]

Izumi: You're gonna love it at Morning Glory, doggy! Everyone’s really nice! Will you build him a doghouse, Uncle Mikio? Pleeease!

Mikio: Uh… Suuure.

Izumi: Really!? Did you hear that, Mame? You get to live in a brand-new house!

Mikio: Mame? You already named him…?

Aggressive Man: Hey, outta the way!

Tamashiro Grunt: This store's Tamashiro property now! Scram!

[The dog barks.]

Tamashiro Grunt: Ugh, quit your fuckin' yapping! Cmon, let's teach that mutt a lesson!

Izumi: No!

Tamashiro Grunt: Well, well, well. The Ryudo's resident lardbucket came to pay us a visit! How bout we show him some hospitality! (punches Mikio) Take this, fatass!

Izumi: Uncle Mikio!

Mikio: Izumi. Take the dog! Go!

Izumi: But…

Mikio: You heard me! Run!

Izumi: Mame. Come on. Please!

[The dog bites one of the grunts in the leg.]

Tamashiro Grunt 2: The shit!?

[The other grabs a plank…]

Izumi: Mame!

[The dog lets go of the second grunt’s leg at a good moment and the first grunt hits the second one in the leg.]

Tamashiro Grunt 2: Don't hit me, hit the dog!

Policeman: You there!

Tamashiro Grunt: (runs away) Crap, we gotta leg it!

Policeman: (chases them) Get back here!

[Kiryu approaches.]

Kiryu: Hey you okay?

Mikio: Oh, sir.

Kiryu: Looks like I was right to worry about you.

Mikio: That was my bad. I tried to stop 'em. Izumi. You all right?

Izumi: Yeah, I think so. Mame! Where's Mame!?

[The dog comes up to Izumi whining and licks her hand.]

Mikio: Ya did it!

Izumi: Mame!

Mikio: A doghouse, huh? I can build stuff, sure… but I dunno if I can build that.

Izumi: Huh? But you promised! Didn't he, Mame?

[The dog barks.]

Mikio: All right, all right. (to Kiryu) We'll go grab some food n' stuff for the dog and meet you back at the orphanage. Sound good?

Kiryu: Yup. Remember to look both ways before you cross the road, Izumi.

Izumi: Okay!

[Mikio, Izumi and the dog leaves.]

Kiryu: (Guess I should head back, too.)

[He returns to the orphanage and finds Rikiya there.]

Rikiya: Aniki!

Kiryu: Rikiya. What are you doing over here?

Rikiya: Well, you said we were gonna be shippin' up to Kamurocho tonight, but I realized we never agreed on a time! Figured I’d stop by and check with you.

Kiryu: Oh, uh… The flight'll be at 8, I guess.

Rikiya: You guess? Shouldn't you have booked by now? And hey, that's pretty late! We're not gonna get into Tokyo ‘til 11!

Kiryu: That's fine. Kamurocho never sleeps, after all.

Rikiya: Good point, Aniki! Oh, and I'm all packed and ready to go. This trip's gonna be great!

Kiryu: We're not going to have fun, Rikiya. This is all business.

Rikiya: Yeah, yeah, I know. Anyways, we got some time 'til we gotta head out for the 8 o'clock flight. Guess I'll just chill here for now.

Kiryu: Right, uh… Good idea.

Rikiya: By the way, Aniki. Take a gander over there.

Kiryu: Hm? Mitsuo and Riona? What about them?

Rikiya: Someone's got a mean case of young love, if you catch me.

Kiryu: I'm not sure I do "catch you."

Rikiya: Just watch, yeah?

Mitsuo: Hey, Riona! You know Okada from school? His dad's like, mega-rich! Apparently he owns three whole movie theaters in town! Did you know that!?

Riona: Yup.

Mitsuo: Oh. Well anyway, me and Okada were talking and he gave me two free tickets for a movie at one of his dad's theaters.

Riona: Uh-huh. Are you sure you didn't beat the tickets out of him?

Mitsuo: What? Of course not!

Riona: Yeah. Sure.

Mitsuo: Anyway, it turns out those tickets're only good until today! Can you believe it!? I'm outta luck if I don't go now. What should I do?

Riona: Um. Just go?

Mitsuo: Well… I wanna, but none of my friends can do it today.

Riona: Huh. Can't you just go alone, then?

Mitsuo: (starts sweating) But… Riona! Will you go with me!?

Riona: Sorry, I have plans.

Mitsuo: Huh? What kinda plans!?

Riona: Don't you have a movie to get to? Maybe Shiro or one of the other guys would wanna go. (leaves)

Mitsuo: Oh, um… yeah.

Rikiya: Ouchie wowchie. That's gotta hurt. Not surprising with those clothes, though.

Kiryu: Not sure you're one to be critiquing fashion, Rikiya.

Rikiya: Oh c'mon! Just look at this luscious hair! Not a single strand outta place!

Kiryu: Yeah, because it's one solid block.

Rikiya: Hold up, Aniki. Do you… not like how I look? Eh, whatever. Guess you're just behind the times.

Kiryu: Excuse me?

Rikiya: You gotta accept that fashions change, old-timer.

Kiryu: I know more about fashion than you do.

Rikiya: Suuure you do, Aniki. Hey, why don't we have a little friendly contest? Y'know, see who's really got the best taste?

Kiryu: A fashion contest, huh? I'm gonna make you regret challenging me, Rikiya.

Rikiya: Heh, sure you are, Aniki. Sure you are. All right, here come the rules. Each of us is gonna pick out some stuff to really make Mitsuo's style pop. One clothin' item and one accessory, got it?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Rikiya: Good, then let's regroup back here when we've got em I'm gonna whoop your ass to high heaven, Aniki! (runs away)

Kiryu: (How do I always end up agreeing to these absurd requests? I do want to help Mitsuo, though. I guess I'll play along.)

[He walks out of the orphanage and sees his neighbor, Miyara.]

Miyara: Ah, Kiryu-san! I couldn't help but overhear! You and that flowery man… Rikiya-kun, was it? You want to make Mitsuo-kun more popular with the ladies, yes?

Kiryu: Uh… yeah. I honestly don't know a whole lot about the latest trends, though. I was just gonna window shop a bit downtown.

Miyara: I see. In that case, I'd recommend stopping in the store right near the big intersection. I've never actually stepped foot in the place myself, but one of the resident neighborhood housewives seemed very keen on their products.

Kiryu: All right, I'll give it a shot. Thanks, Miyara-san.

[Kiryu goes out into town and approaches a tent selling clothes.]

Employee: Hello there, sir. What can help you with?

Kiryu: Hopefully a lot. I'm looking for some children's clothes, and maybe an accessory to go with them.

Employee: Just a moment, sir. Allow me to show you what we have in stock.

Kiryu: (…Pretty limited selection. What should I pick?)

An American Flag Polo
A Dragon Print Polo ✓

Kiryu: I'll take that dragon print polo. Nothing quite like a dragon.

Employee: Excellent choice, sir. And for the accessory?

Kiryu: (Only two options again? Guess I'll go with..)

A Ten Gallon Hat
Sunglasses ✓

Kiryu: I'll go with the sunglasses. Not much cooler than that.

Employee: Very good, sir. The dragon print polo and the sunglasses comes out to 2,000 yen, sir.

Perfect, here you go. ✓
Actually, I changed my mind.

Employee: (bows) Here are your items, sir. Thank you for stopping by!

Kiryu: (All right, now to get home and show Rikiya what’s what!)

[He returns to the orphanage. Rikiya’s already there.]

Rikiya: Well, Aniki? Ready to get the fashion beatdown?

Kiryu: Actually, I'm pretty confident. How are you feeling, Rikiya?

Rikiya: Oh, you don't gotta worry about me. I'll be just fine. Anyway, lemme go grab Mitsuo!

[He leaves and returns with Mitsuo.]

Rikiya: We're back, Aniki!

Mitsuo: What is it, Uncle Kaz? I'm not really feeling so good…

Kiryu: You'll feel better soon, Mitsuo. We're gonna give you a fashion makeover.

Mitsuo: Whoa, really!?

Rikiya: Heck yeah! You're gonna have to claw the ladies off ya, and it'll all be thanks to me and my amazing taste!

Mitsuo: I dunno about this…

Rikiya: C'mon, it'll be fine! All you gotta do is put the clothes on and tell us what you like better.

Kiryu: You can start with mine. I got you sunglasses and a dragon print polo.

Mitsuo: Uh…

Rikiya: You gotta be kidding me, Aniki. The kid's gonna be too shy, to look in a damn mirror if you dress him up like that!

Kiryu: Really? But I thought fashion was all about standing out…

Rikiya: Oh he's gonna stand out, all right! Like a sore freaking thumb!

Kiryu: Hm…

Rikiya: Not to worry, Mitsuo! I've got the solution to all your girl troubles here!

Mitsuo: Okay! What is it, Uncle Rikiya?

Rikiya: Man, you're gonna love this… Tada! A short jacket, baggy pants, and of course you can't go anywhere without a nice old school bag! It's kinda squished, but who cares?

Mitsuo: Um…

Kiryu: ……

Rikiya: C'mon, it's my old gear from when I was in Junior high! Took a while to round it all up, mind you. Girls go gaga for this bad boy stuff, trust me. You'll have to beat 'em off with a stick! Well? You want it, right?

Mitsuo: No way.

Rikiya: Huh!? But, but, but… don't you wanna look cool!?

Mitsuo: Yeah, that's why I'm not taking your clothes! Nobody wears stuff like that anymore. And besides, why would I wear your junior high clothes? I'm still in elementary school! I'd rather take the things Uncle Kaz picked out!

Kiryu: Heh. Who's behind the times now, Rikiya? I haven't seen clothes like that in years.

Rikiya: Not like you did any better!

Kiryu: Don't be like that. You lost fair and square. To me. An "'old-timer." Why don't you go get changed, Mitsuo?

Mitsuo: All right, but I'm not really feeling this either…

Kiryu: Just try it on. It's good to change up your vibe sometimes.

Mitsuo: If you say so…

[He changes into the clothes Kiryu bought.]

Mitsuo: Are you sure this is cool? It feels kinda… not.

Rikiya: Heh, you look like a yakuza in trainin'.

Kiryu: I don't think it's that bad. And hey, doesn't the dragon print make you feel closer to your Uncle Kaz?

Rikiya: It's always dragons with you, Aniki…

Kiryu: All right, Mitsuo. Get over there and show Riona what you’ve got!

Mitsuo: Okay…

[He goes to Riona, while Kiryu and Rikia hide nearby to overhear their conversation.]

Mitsuo: Hey, Riona. I couldn't find anyone else who wanted to go to the movie with me, so… Are you sure you don't wanna come?

Riona: Uh, what are you wearing? I wouldn't be caught dead in a movie theater with a guy dressed like… that. Anyway, I already said I have plans.

Mitsuo: Right…

Rikiya: Shit, he got flat-out rejected and insulted to boot…

Kiryu: ……

[They approach Mitsuo.]

Mitsuo: Maybe she's just not into me, Uncle Kaz…

Kiryu: Hey, you can't give up after one small failure. You have to keep trying, Mitsuo.

Mitsuo: Maybe… but I think she likes this guy Okada from my class.

Kiryu: Then you'll just have to prove you're better than him.

Mitsuo: What!? But he's really cool! And his dad's super rich!

Kiryu: But you don't even know if he likes her. You can't ignore how you feel, Mitsuo.

Mitsuo: Huh?

Kiryu: Well? You like her, right? 

Mitsuo: …Yeah. I really like her.

Kiryu: Then you know what you need to do.

Mitsuo: You're right. I'm not gonna give up! Anyway, I should go grab Taichi. He said he'd see the movie with me if Riona didn’t wanna go.

Kiryu: Heh, glad you have someone to go with. (It's a shame Mitsuo couldn't get Riona to go with him, but I guess she did have other plans. Maybe I should head into town, keep an eye on Mitsuo and Taichi.)

[He is walking toward the exit of the orphanage when suddenly Riona runs up to him.]

Riona: Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: What's up, Riona?

Riona: Do you know where Haruka-chan is? I need to talk to her!

Kiryu: Probably out shopping for groceries if she's not home.

Riona: Huh!? But I need her now!

Kiryu: What's the rush?

Riona: Well, I'm gonna go hang out with some friends from school, so I was trying to make a bento. But I can't figure out how to make duruwakashi… You know, the mashed taro with pork? I've definitely seen Haruka-chan make it before, but I can't find her anywhere. Do you know how to make it, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: More or less. I'm not a local, but I can manage.

Riona: Really? Come on, teach me! Let's go!

[She runs to the house.]

Kiryu: All right, all right, Calm down.

[Kiryu teaches Riona how to cook duruwakashi behind the scenes.]

Kiryu: So? Think you understand?

Riona: Yeah! Thanks, Uncle Kaz! I didn't realize you could make stuff that wasn't curry!

Kiryu: …I guess my menu has been a bit limited at times. Anyway, go have fun. And stay out of the street, okay?

Riona: Mhm!

[Kiryu leaves the kitchen, after which Haruka approaches Riona. Kiryu overhears their conversation.]

Haruka: Hi, Riona-chan! What are you making that bento for? Are you going on a date?

Riona: Yeah, though it's not gonna be just us.

Haruka: …Is it with Mitsuo?

Riona: What? No!

Haruka: Oh… Well, I think you two would be good together. I know he's kinda immature sometimes, but you'd be happy with him, Riona-chan.

Riona: Look, it's not gonna happen, Haruka-chan! I just can't see myself dating a black guy!

Haruka: Riona-chan!

Riona: Sorry, that came out wrong…

[Note - In Japan, there are people with darker and lighter skin tones. Light skin tends to be found among the upper class and dark skin among peasants because they had to work a lot in the fields under the scorching sun. So in this case, Riona simply considered it beneath her dignity to date a peasant.]

Kiryu: ……

Riona: Anyway, I have to go!

[She runs out of the kitchen.]

Kiryu: (Sounds like she doesn't like Mitsuo because he's different. That's not how I raised her…)

[Taichi enters.]

Taichi: What the heck? Riona nearly ran right into me…

Kiryu: Taichi.

Taichi: Huh? Oh, hi, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: Aren't you supposed to be at the movies with Mitsuo?

Taichi: I was gonna go, but then he told me it was some gross love story! I don't wanna see that with him!

Kiryu: …And where is he now?

Taichi: I dunno, he just kinda walked off. He didn't look too happy…

Kiryu: Do you remember which direction he went in?

Taichi: Pretty sure it was over towards downtown. Oh, I bet he's gonna go see that movie by himself!

Kiryu: (Hm. Sounds like I should check up on him.)

Find Mitsuo!
Kiryu: (I hope Mitsuo's okay. My best bet would be to head downtown and see if I can head him off.)

[He finds Mitsuo near the local Burger King]

Kiryu: (There he is. What's he doing over here…?) Hey, Mit— (Wait. That's… Riona. And those must be her friends from school.)

Takako: Where to next, Okada-kun? I’ll go anywhere as long as you're there with me!

Okada: My dad has a hotel pretty close to here with a biiiig pool! Maybe we can go for a swim?

Takako: Wow, that sounds amazing, Okada-kun!

Mamoru: Heck yeah! I've never been in a hotel pool before!

Riona: Um…

Okada: Something wrong, Riona-chan?

Riona: No, it's… It's nothing.

Takako: Oh yeah! Riona has that gross burn on her arm!

Riona: ……

Takako: She's probably too much of a wimp to go in the pool 'cause then everyone'd be able to see it.

[Mamoru drags Riona by the arm forcing her to show the burn.]

Mamoru: Wait, is it really that gross? I wanna see! C'mon!

Riona: Stop it! Please! Stop!

[Mamoru pulls up the sleeve of Riona's T-shirt and everyone can see the large prodigious burn on her left arm.]

Mamoru: Whoa, just look at it.

[Riona barely holds back tears.]

Okada: What the heck? You're disgusting.

[Seeing this, Mitsuo, standing to the side, grinds his teeth in anger. Riona falls to her knees and begins to cry. Kiryu observes the situation, deciding what to do when suddenly Mitsuo runs towards Okada and punches him in the face with a swing.]

Mitsuo: You'll pay for that!

[Okada falls to the asphalt.]

Okada: Mitsuo?

Mamoru: What was that? Take this!

[Mamoru quickly walks up to Mitsuo and punches him in the face. Mitsuo goes down.]

Takako: What's up with him?

[She runs up to Okada.]

Takako: Are you hurt, Okada-kun? You orphans are the worst! Come on, Okada-kun!

[Okada, Mamoru and Takako leaves.]

Mitsuo: (to Riona) Sorry. I wasn't following you or anything, I swear! I was just in the area, and… You okay?

Riona: Mitsuo. You don't think it's gross?

Mitsuo: What?

Riona: My burn.

Mitsuo: Of course not! I know this isn't easy for you, Riona… But hey, look at me. I don't even have to go outside and I'm the darkest kid in town! That's way weirder than any scar, huh? …Bad joke.

Riona: I'm so sorry.

Mitsuo: Huh? For what?

[She hugs Mitsuo and starts crying. We go back to the orphanage. Mitsuo and Riona sit together in one of the rooms of the house.]

Mitsuo: Owww…

Riona: Sorry, just a little more.

[Riona tends Mitsuo’s bruise. Rikiya and Kiryu are watching them from the yard.]

Rikiya: Huh? What's goin' on?

Kiryu: Looks like Mitsuo didn't need your help after all.

Rikiya: Not like your suggestion was any better…

Kiryu: Did you say something?

Rikiya: Nope, nothing at all! Haha!

Kiryu: By the way, Rikiya. You should probably go grab your bags. Our flight's pretty soon.

Rikiya: Huh? Shit on a stick, you're right! Lemme head home real quick, and I'll be back before you know it. See you in a bit, Aniki!

[He runs away.]

Kiryu: (Sorry, Rikiya. This has to be a one-man job.)

Koji: Hey, Uncle Kaz! Let's play some baseball!

Kiryu: (I guess I do have a little time before I have to go.) All right, but just a bit, okay?

Koji: Yeah! I'm pumped! (to the others) Hey, guys! Uncle Kaz is gonna play with us! We'll meet you down at the beach, okay? Don't make us wait! Baseball boys… Baseball girls… Move out!

[Children merrily run to the beach.]

Mitsuo: (throws the ball) Take this!

[Koji misses.]

Haruka: Strike!

Koji: Oh, c’mon!

[He notices a boy sitting nearby.]

Koji: Hey, Taichi. That kid's been hanging around here a lot, huh? Who is he?

Taichi: Beats me.

Haruka: Why don't you go see if he wants to play?

[Kiryu approaches the beach.]

Kiryu: (Hm? I don't recognize that kid.)

[Meanwhile Koji and Taichi run up to the kid.]

Koji: Hey, do you live around here?

Timid Boy: Y-Yeah…

Koji: Cool! I'm Koji! What's your name?

Timid Boy: It's Akira.

Taichi: Well, Akira, you wanna play with us? You know how to play baseball, righ?

Akira: I, um…

Taichi: C'mon, it'll be fun!

Koji: Yeah, let's play!

Akira: But… I've never played before. I bet I'm really bad at it, just like I'm bad at everything else. PE's the only time I play sports, and even then I always get picked last…

Taichi: Don't worry, we'll teach you!

Akira: But…

Koji: We were just saying how we needed another guy, C'mon!

Akira: Huh?

Koji: We've got two girls and five boys, so one more boy'll even out the teams! Right, Taichi?

Taichi: Yeah, we'd love for you to join!

Koji: Some of the other kids are pretty young, too, so we won't go too hard, promise.

Akira: All right, maybe I could play a bit. Thanks!

[Kiryu approaches them.]

Koji: Hi, Uncle Kaz! This is our new friend, Akira-kun!

Akira: (bows) H-Hello.

Kiryu: Looks like you guys are having fun.

Koji: Yeah! We're teaching Akira-kun how to bat, since he's never played baseball before. It's not going so good, though… I know, Uncle Kaz! You hit some balls and we'll try to catch them! Sounds fun, right?

Kiryu: Heh, yeah I don't mind taking a few swings.

Koji: Awesome! C'mon, Akira-kun! Let's go catch some fly balls!

Akira: Okay!

[Kiryu pretends not to play well and misses most balls. The kids have fun chasing balls down the beach.]

Kiryu: Phew, that was a good workout.

Koji: Well, Akira-kun? That was pretty fun, huh?

Akira: Yeah!

Koji: Then we're done warming up! Time to play for real!

Akira: …For real?

Taichi: Yup. We don't have enough people for a game or anything, but we take turns at bat and everyone else plays defense!

Koji: Where should we put Akira-kun?

Taichi: How about right field? It's the perfect spot for beginners.

Koji: Good idea. Everyone get into position!

Akira: W-Wait, what's right field?

Taichi: Seriously? You don't know?

Koji: Lay off him, Taichi. It's his first time, remember? Right field's over there. Pretty far from the batter. Just stand back there and get the ball if it comes your way. Then throw it to Mitsuo, okay? You'll be fine, Akira-kun.

Akira: All right…

Kiryu: All you need is a little confidence, Akira. Just believe in yourself. Anyway, I'm gonna head inside for a bit. Keep an eye on him, Koji.

Koji: Will do! Let's get you in position, Akira-kun!

[Kiryu returns to the house as Haruka suddenly runs up to him.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz! Akira-kun, he…!

[Some time passes. The children have gathered in the yard and are watching. Akira's mother comes to the orphanage. She reprimands Koji. Kiryu is standing next to him.]

Akira's Mom: Baseball!? What in the world were you thinking!? Do you hear me, young man!? My Akira-chan is a fragile boy! He can't be playing sports with you ruffians!

Kiryu: What happened, Koji?

Koji: Well, um… Akira-kun tripped and hit his head when he was running after a fly ball.

Akira's Mom: Running!? Does my Akira-chan look like the kind of boy who runs!? How dare you!

Kiryu: I don't see why not. Does he have some kind of health condition that keeps him from exercising?

Akira's Mom: Well no, but baseball is absurdly dangerous! I can't believe you would let your children play it unsupervised!

Kiryu: How dangerous can it be with a rubber ball and a plastic bat? Besides, it's totally normal for kids their age to be playing sports on their own.

Koji: …It's okay, Uncle Kaz. This was all my fault. I made Akira-kun do it.

Man's Voice: Hello? What's going on in here?

[The teacher, Hashimoto, enters.]

Hashimoto: Oh, Miyamura-san! I rushed over as soon as I heard what happened to your son. I'm terribly sorry.

Akira's Mom: Sorry isn't good enough, Hashimoto-sensei! Just what are you teaching these children, hml? The school board is going to hear about this, I can promise you that!

Kiryu: The school has nothing to do with it.

Hashimoto: *sigh* Why is it that you always seem to be at the center of my problems, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: What was that?

Akira's Mom: Wait. You know this brute, Hashimoto-sensei!?

Hashimoto: Not exactly. He runs this orphanage, though. These foul-tempered orphans of his caused quite the trouble for my son recently.

Akira's Mom: What!? Then is it possible they forced my poor, sweet Akira-chan to play that horrible game with them!? I simply cannot stand for this! (to Koji) Well? What do you have to say for yourself, young man? This silly game was just an excuse to bully my innocent boy, wasn’t it!? Tell me the truth!

Kiryu: Koji's no bully.

Akira's Mom: How am I supposed to believe that after what happened to my Akira-chan!? Police! I want the police here!

Hashimoto: Yes, ma'am! I'll call them right away!

[Akira was lying on the futon the whole time. Perhaps he was unconscious.]

Akira: Ungh…

Akira's Mom: Don't worry, Akira-chan! The nice cops will be here soon!

Akira: K-Koji-kun…

Koji: Akira-kun.

Akira: I'm so sorry. You guys let me play with you, then I had to go and mess it all up. It was… fun, though. Baseball. Maybe we can play again sometime? Once I get better.

Koji: Of course!

Akira's Mom: Baseball, Akira-chan? What are you saying!? You must have hit your head even harder than you realized! And don't get any ideas about seeing these awful orphans again! I'm forbidding you from ever coming back here!

Akira: They're not awful, mom. And they didn't pressure me into playing with them. I wanted to. Koji-kun and Taichi-kun are really nice. Way nicer than the other kids in my class. So don't be mean to them.

Akira's Mother: But Akira-chan!

Akira: No, mom. Everyone here gets along so well. Nobody'd ever bully me… Not like at school.

Akira's Mom: What!? You're being bullied at school!?

Akira: …Sometimes.

Akira's Mom: By who!? Tell me his name!

Akira: One of the older kids. Hashimoto-kun.

Hashimoto: (shocked) Huh!?

Akira's Mom: How could this happen!? (to Hashimoto in rage) You! What is the meaning of this? Explain yourself! Or should I involve the board!? And you're a teacher! This is how you raise your own son!?

Koji: (to Akira) Get better soon, Akira-kun! There's a lot we still have to teach you!

[Akira nods and smiles. After a while, Akira, his mother and Hashimoto leave. Or rather, Hashimoto runs away and Akira's mother runs after him!]

Kiryu: Well, that's a helicopter mom if I've ever seen one. She didn't mean what she said, Koji. Don't let it get to you, okay?

Koji: I won't! Especially 'cause I made a new friend out of it!

Kiryu: Heh, that's one way to look at it. You're a good kid, Koji.

Haruka: Isn't your flight soon, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

Haruka: Just let me know when you're gonna leave, okay? I’ll get the others to come say goodbye. Or… are you leaving now?

Not quite yet. ✓
Yeah, it's time to go.

Kiryu: Not quite yet. Still have some things to do around town.

Haruka: Oh, okay. Want me to come with you?

Not this time. ✓
Of course I do.

Kiryu: Not this time. Sorry, Haruka.

Haruka: It's okay! Just come let me know when you're about to leave, okay?

[After a while, Kiryu returns to the orphanage.]

Haruka: Isn't your flight soon, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

Haruka: Just let me know when you're gonna leave, okay? I’ll get the others to come say goodbye. Or… are you leaving now?

Not quite yet. 
Yeah, it's time to go. ✓

Kiryu: Yeah, it's time to go.

Haruka: Okay! Just a second, I'll grab everyone.

Kiryu: Thanks, Haruka.

[All the children gather in the yard and Kiryu gets dressed.]

Ayako: What's up with those clothes, Unde Kaz?

Kiryu: I'm actually heading up to Tokyo. For about a week.

Taichi: Whoa, really!?

Riona: That's awesome! I'm coming, too!

Mitsuo: Yeah! Take us with you!

Kiryu: Sorry, kids. It's not gonna be a vacation. Your Unele Kaz has some very important business to take care of. But while I'm gone, a new friend is gonna come live here with you. 

[Haruka and Saki enter the orphanage.]

Kiryu: This is Saki. She's been through a lot, so she has some trouble talking. Her dad's hurt too. He's in the hospital right now. For the time being, I told her she can stay here. So what do you say? Can you make her feel at home?

Taichi: Darn right we can!

Ayako: Come on, Saki-chan!

[She takes Saki to the others. They introduce themselves. Saki smiles.]

Go To Kamurocho
Haruka: Stay safe out there, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: I will.

Haruka: Oh, I almost forgot! Here's your ticket.

Kiryu: You… bought me a plane ticket?

Haruka: Mhm! You deserve a present after how much you've been helping everyone.

Kiryu: Thanks, Haruka. That means a lot.

Haruka: By the way, I'm gonna go into town to get some stuff for dinner. Maybe we can go together until you have to leave?

Kiryu: I'd like that.

Haruka: Yay! And don't worry, I can get home on my own afterward.

Kiryu: Heh, you're growing up so fast, Haruka. Anyway, where are you headed?

Haruka: The public market downtown! They have a lot of stuff there, and it's all super cheap!

[They hold hands and go into town. In the market…]

Haruka: I have a lot of stuff to get so you can wait here, Uncle Kaz. Or maybe go upstairs? I think there are supposed to be some good restaurants up there!

Kiryu: Sure, I’ll take a look.

[Kiryu wanders around the market for a while, examining the stalls.]

Haruka: I'm back, Uncle Kaz! Hope I didn't keep you waiting!

Kiryu: Not at all. You get everything you need?

Haruka: Yup! That should be enough to last us for like, three days!

Kiryu: …Where's the food?

Haruka: Oh, I bought so much they said they'll bring it over for me! Perks of being a regular, hehe!

Kiryu: Huh. I didn't even know they offered that kind of service.

Haruka: I don't think they do normally! But I get all our food over here, and we need so much to feed all the kids, so they make an exception for me. Anyway, you should probably start heading to the airport, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: Right. Want me to walk you back to the monorail before I go?

Haruka: Yes please!

[They walk to the monorail station.]

Haruka: Isn't your flight soon, Uncle Kaz?

I still have some time.
Yeah, I should get going. ✓

Kiryu: Yeah, I should probably get going.

Haruka: Okay. Don't get in too much trouble, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: Same to you. You're sure you can make it home from here, right?

Haruka: Come on, I'm a big girl! I'm going into junior high next month, remember?

Kiryu: Heh, sorry. Anyway, I've gotta run. Keep an eye on everyone for me while I'm gone, Haruka.

Haruka: I’ll be the best babysitter ever!

Kiryu: (She's really gotten so mature… Well, better head to the airport.)

[Haruka leaves. A black guy runs up to Kiryu.]

Cheerful Foreigner: Hey, you there! Oh, yeah! You're perfect, man! That physique, that mystique! Just perfect! Mm mmm!

Kiryu: …What do you want?

Mack: Oh, sorry for creeping you out. The name's Mack. I travel the globe, photographing only the absolute coolest shit the world has ever seen!

Kiryu: …Right. I'm Kiryu. Do you need something? I kinda have places to be.

Mack: You know what a Revelation is, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: It's… something like an epiphany, right?

Mack: Bingo ringo, my man! Lemme tell you, every single shot I take tries to drag the pure beauty out of everything. Nature, people, the works. Now a Revelation? That's basically a moment of mental clarity that only comes when you see that pure beauty. Wanna learn how to learn 'em, Kiryu-san? I promise they'll come in major handy!

Kiryu: Oh, so you're not a creep. Guess that's what I get for assuming. Either way, I'm not much of a photographer. I don't even own a camera.

Mack: No problemo, big boy! Anything'll work, even a phone camera! You see, it's all about the method, not the tool. Trust me, Kiryu-san. I got a third eye for talent, and you've got it oozing outta your pores!

Kiryu: Uh… Thanks? Anyway, are you sure this'll work with just my phone camera?

Mack: Of course! Just step on over here for a sec.

[They go to the crossroads.]

Mack: Now where's that shot? Hmmm… Ah, Kiryu-san! I can feel it! There you go. Take a peek at that sweet old bag of bones on the scooter. Something's gonna go down here, believe you me! And when it does, a flash of inspiration's gonna strike you like a friggin' sledgehammer to the temple! Oh, and don't forget to blog about it afterward! Gotta spread the love, get those sweet, sweet internet points.

Kiryu: …I have no idea what you're talking about.

Mack: Don't worry, I’ll show you the ropes!

[He teaches Kiryu how to post in a blog.]

Mack: See? All you gotta do is spill your heart out, press that big red update button… and voilà!

Kiryu: Huh.

Mack: See? Not so tough!

Kiryu: …Yeah, I guess not.

Mack: Now then, Kiryu-san! Keep your eyes tuned on that scooter and get ready to be inspired!

Kiryu: (…Is this really gonna work? Guess I'll find out soon enough.)

[He takes a closer look at grandma on the scooter and pulls out his phone. The grandma notices a handsome young man on a billboard and takes her eyes off the road.]

Grandma: Why, hello there.

Bypasser: Hey, look out!

[The grandmother crashes into the car in front of her, but is so engrossed in her love fantasies that she does not notice it.]

Grandma: Yu-sama!

[Grandma flies over the car in slow motion.]

Boy on Billboard: (in grandma’s head) I’m II Yu-Jin. 

Grandma: Mmm… Hehehe…

Boy on Billboard: (in grandma’s head) I’m II Yu-Jin. 

Grandma: Mmm… Hehehe…

Boy on Billboard: (in grandma’s head) I’m II Yu… 

Grandma: Hehe…

Boy on Billboard: (in grandma’s head) I love you.

Grandma: *sigh*

[Grandma lands safely on the road and continues to ride her scooter.]

Grandma: I could look at you all day!

Bypasser: She did a flip! Love’s a magical thing…

[Now Kiryu needs to come up with a caption for the photo…]

Leap, flip, and stick the landing. Magnificent… ✓
Hit the enemy while they're distracted, Sneaky.
She stayed upright the whole time. Must be pretty tough.

[And now Kiryu finally makes his first blog post!]

Here We Go
Theme: Revelations
Hey there, Kazuma here starting this blog about these things called revelations, inspirations I get from some of the crazy things that happen around town. This one's about the picture on the right. They say love is blind, and apparently, it hits even when you're riding a bike. Now I have an amazing move to make use of my surroundings.

Nickname: Kazuma
Gender: Male
DOB: 6/17/68
Blood Type: 0
Hometown Yokohama
About: I live in Okinawa and work at an orphanage I write about the amazing and often inspiring events I see in the city. My motto is… [Read on]

Mack: Great, Kiryu-san! 11/10 on the execution! That turned out even better than I had imagined!

Kiryu: Can't say I expected much, but I actually learned something. Thanks for the tip, Mack.

Mack: Of course, Kiryu-san! Seeing you see what you saw, it felt like I was learning, too! You know… I think you might be the guy who finally takes the perfect shot I've been after all these years.

Kiryu: What do you mean, perfect shot?

Mack: That's the thing… I dunno what it is. I've touched hearts and minds with my photos, but I've never been satisfied with my work. So… I guess the perfect shot would be something that touches me just like I touched those other people!

Kiryu: Huh. Makes sense.

Mack: Anyways, I'm off to travel the world! The cliffs of Machu Picchu! The splendor of Angkor Wat! The natural grandeur of the Norwegian fjords! Who knows where inspiration'll strike! Oh, and I won't be leaving you in the dark, either! I'll shoot you an email if I hear of anything that might lead to a revelation!

Kiryu: Sounds good. Later, Mack.

Mack: Until we meet again, Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: (Well that was… something. Time to go.)

[His phone’s ringing…]

Taichi: Yo, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Hey, Taichi. What's up?

Taichi: Oh, nothing. Izumi just keeps complaining she's bored. If you could come back to Morning Glory for a bit, that'd be real great. If, y'know, you have the time.

Kiryu: That should be fine…

Taichi: No pressure, though. I know you're out there doing your thing, whatever it is. Hope to see you soon, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: (Maybe I'd better stop by Morning Glory before I head out to Kamurocho… Those kids need me.)

[Kiryu returns to the orphanage.]

Taichi: Man… I am so bored right now. Isn't there anything fun we can do?

Shiro: Well, there's nothing on TV—and I checked all the channels. I must have read my manga a thousand times, too.

Izumi: Hey, I know! Let's make up a game! C'mon, it'll be fun!

Kiryu: Hey, kids. What are you three up to?

Taichi: Nothing! That's the problem. We're practically dying of boredom, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Oh yeah? I can think of plenty for you to do.

Shiro: But you're just gonna make us do chores, Uncle Kaz! Even doing nothing is better than that.

Kiryu: What about your homework, then?

Izumi: We already finished it—every last page!

Taichi: Ooh, ooh! I got it! Why don't we go play hide-and-seek? And Uncle Kaz can be it!

Kiryu: Hm… Now that's something I haven't played in ages…

Sure, why not? ✓
Maybe next time.

Kiryu: Sure, why not? It's good for you kids to play outside.

Taichi: Yesss! With Uncle Kaz hot on our trail, this'll be the best game of hide-and-seek ever!

Izumi: Ooh, I'll go get Eri-chan, too! We can all play together!

Shiro: It sure has been a while… And it might be nice to go outside, too.

Taichi: Oh, and by the way, Uncle Kaz. Izumi"ll start crying if you find her too quick, so try to save her for last, okay?

Kiryu: Got it. It's nice of you to look out for her like that, Taichi.

Taichi: Haha, well I'm basically the big brother around here! Gotta make sure everyone's happy. Okay, Eri-chan's here! Is anyone else coming?

Izumi: Nope. I couldn't find Haruka-chan, and everyone else is busy cooking or something.

Eri: Hey, Izumi-chan? Can we… hide together?

Izumi: Not this time. Uncle Kaz would spot us in a milisecond!

Taichi: Okay everyone, you're allowed to hide inside and in the front yard! Uncle Kaz here will kindly count to ten while we all hide! Everyone got it? Then… On your marks… Get set… GO!

Kiryu: One… two… three… four… five… six… seven… eight… nine… Ten! Ready or not, here I come! (Aha… That must be Eri.) Gotcha, Eri!

Eri: Huh? Oh, rats! That was way too quick, Uncle Kaz! I wish I could've stayed hidden a little longer!

Kiryu: Sorry, Eri. That's just part of the game. Now, on to the next one.

Kiryu: (Is that Shiro I see there?) Gotcha, Shiro!

Shiro: What!? But this spot's never failed me before! You're great at this, Uncle Kaz. Nobody's ever seen me back there.

Kiryu: Heh, guess you learned something new about me today. Well, on to the next one.

Kiryu: (That's definitely Taichi. How'd he even get up there?) Gotch, Taichi!

Taichi: Aw, man!I thought you were never gonna find me! Wow, you're better at this than I thought, Uncle Kaz. How'd you even find me up there?

Kiryu: Oh, you know. I have a lot of practice from when I was a kid. But hey, you win some and you lose some. On to the next.

Kiryu: (…Looks like I found Izumi.) Gotcha, Izumi!

Izumi: What!? You actually found me? *sigh* And I was keeping so still, too…

Kiryu: You had a great hiding spot, Izumi. That's why it took me so long to find you. Anyway, let's go meet up with the others. 

Kiryu: Well, I found everybody. Did you all enjoy yourselves?

Shiro: Yeah! I thought we made it pretty tough for you, but I guess not.

Izumi: I was the very last one. Didn't I do a good job hiding, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: You sure did, Izumi, You were the best.

Taichi: (Good one, Uncle Kaz. Thanks for doing that for her.)

Kiryu: (No problem.)

Eri: Wasn't it fun playing together with everyone? Let's do this again sometime!

Izumi: But I promise it won't be any easier!

Kiryu: Heh, I hope not.

Taichi: Come on everyone, let's go study! See you later, Uncle Kaz!

[After finishing his business, Kiryu gets on a plane and flies to Tokyo.]

MEANWHILE, 
IN MINATO, TOKYO…

[We find ourselves in a stylishly furnished office. An athletic, muscular man with a dragon tattoo on his back is punching a punching bag. Someone knocks on the door.]

Man With Dragon Tattoo: It's open.

Secretary: Chairman. Regarding today's schedule… We've received a call from Kashiwagi-san. He wants to arrange a meeting of the clan leadership.

Man With Dragon Tattoo: Well all right then.

Secretary: And your conference tonight with those IT venture capitalists, Chairman?

Man With Dragon Tattoo: Cancel it. There's no turning your back when headquarters comes knocking.

Secretary:  Understood, sir.

MEANWHILE, IN CHINATOWN,
YOKOHAMA…

[Chinese restaurant. From the kitchen you can hear the horrible sounds - you'd think people were being killed, but it turns out to be Yakuza torturing the restaurant owner by showing him his knife skills - he's chopping up a pork carcass.]

Yakuza: Strange place, China. Wouldn't you say? You people eat anything. Pigeons, frogs. Hell, even cats and dogs end up on the dinner table. Whatever it takes to keep yourselves alive. But you know, man? I have to hand it to you Chinese snakes. Laying down roots in someone else's country takes serious balls. That’s a mafia-level move right there.

Chief: I not mafia! I just chef!

[The yakuza puts a fried goose in front of the chief.]

Yakuza: Let's be pals, Chin-san. All your neighbors are on board. They pay their dues. A million a month.

Chief: A million!?

Yakuza: Considering how long you've been yanking our fucking chain… It's a pretty good deal. But I'd gladly take the deed to this little shithole if you can't pay up. There's a job in one of our restaurants with your name on it.

Chief: No! It not possible!

[The yakuza chops off the goose head but the chief thinks it was his hand, out of fear.]

Yakuza: Sometimes I forget how sharp Chinese knives can be. Could probably slice a man's head clean off. How about we test it out? (picks up the goose head) Your food's got quite a reputation around these parts, Chin-san.

[Yakuza vilely devours his head along with his beak. His subordinate enters.]

Yakuza’s Subordinate: Boss. We just received a call from HQ. They want to discuss the sixth chairman.

Chief: Please, it not possible!

Yakuza: Oh yeah? Fair enough. If you can't do it… You can't do it.

[He puts a large suitcase in front of the chief.]

Yakuza: Sorry I had to go rustling your jimmies like this, Chin-san. This'll make it up to you. Something to remember me by. All I wanted was to be partners, Chin-san. My bad if I came on too strong. Let me know if you change your tune. Bye now.

[Yakuza and his subordinate leave. After waiting for them to leave, the Chief decides to open the suitcase. The restaurant blows up.]

MEANWHILE,
IN KAMUROCHO, TOKYO…

[A yakuza office. On the wall hangs a sign with two characters 似任 (if I get it right of course). The first characters mean "becoming, resemble, counterfeit, imitate, suitable" and the second - "responsibility, duty, term, entrust to, appoint". There are screams coming from the boss's office - it looks like a terrible rape is going on there. Other yakuza look bored, smoking and reading magazines.]

Yakuza 1: I dunno how the boss handles porkers like that.

Yakuza 2: Eh, he's never really been the discriminatin' type, y'know? Anything goes so long as they got meat on their bones.

[Phone rings.]

Yakuza 2: Heyo, Nishikiyama Industries. My apologies, sir! Yes. The boss is in at the moment, but… Huh? A meeting? (to Yakuza 1) It's HQ. Somethin' about an urgent meetin'. (to the phone) Understood, sir. I'll pass that along.

[The yakuzas get in line next to the boss' office door. The boss, a fat , greasy bald guy comes out of his office.]

Yakuzas: (bows) A job well done, sir!

Boss: So? What time's it at?

Yakuza 2: Huh?

Boss: (slaps Yakuza 2) The meetin', dipshit!

Yakuza 2: What? How did you…?

Boss: HQ just rang you up, right!? Might be horny as all hell, but I ain't deaf!

Yakuza 2: My apologies, sir! They said it's at seven!

[The boss slaps every yakuza in the line.]

Boss: There ya go! That's what I'm fuckin' talking about!

Yakuzas: (bows) Thank you very much, sir!

Boss: I'm on top of the goddamn world! Nishino! Hirai! Round up as many sorry sons o' bitches as ya can! Tonight! Miyauchi! Give Hasebe a ring! That club's gonna be ours once and for all! Horiguchi! Ishida! Phone Mine! Tell him to bring a whole fuckin' billion! In cash!It's here… The war's finally startin’! No gettin' caught with our pants down!

[He leaves the office. We switch to the man with a dragon tattoo driving a car and talking on the phone.]

Man With Dragon Tattoo: Hm? Did you say a billion?

Fat Boss: Ya heard me! I want it, and I want it in cash!

Man With Dragon Tattoo: Kanda-aniki. Just what are you planning?

Kanda: A fuckin' war!

Man With Dragon Tattoo: War?

Kanda: The one that decides who's takin' the Tojo reins!

Man With Dragon Tattoo: Aniki, the sixth chairman is very much alive. This seems somehow premature.

Kanda: I'll show you premature! Just shut it and bring me my money!

Man With Dragon Tattoo: Very well. (hungs up) Hmph. Asshole. 

[Kiryu finally arrives in Kamurocho. He walks slowly and looks around.]

Kiryu: No different than the day I left it.

[He notices a man throwing some women out of Stardust.]

Woman 1: Help us!

Woman 2: The heck was that!? Someone call the cops!

Woman 3: Owww. Lemme go! What's the big idea, huh!?

Man: Can it! I told you we're booked! Now get outta here!

Woman 3: Ugh!

Kiryu: (Something's going on at Stardust. Might want to drop in before I go see Kashiwagi-san.)

[Kiryu walks into Stardust and finds several Yakuza there. There's a big pile of cash on the table.]

Yakuza: You can take your cash and shove it! What's that dogshit attitude for, huh? We're payin' customers!

Kazuki: Not ones we want.

Yakuza: Ya host dicks lookin' down on us!?

Yuya: Kiryu-san!

Kazuki: Kiryu-san!

Hasebe (Yakuza): Hm? The fuck are you, pretty boy?

Yuya: You don't know? That's the fourth chairman of the Tojo Clan, Kazuma Kiryu-san!

Hasebe: Hmmm? Oh… Ohhh! I know you! Then you'll know to back off! Open those ears real good, Fourth Chairman-han. I dunno what you're strollin' in here for, but lemme set the record straight. Me and these gentlemen? We're just havin' a friendly little chitchat. Not a suspicious thing about it, cross my heart n' hope to die. So why don't you go runnin' along home?

Kiryu: Kazuki. What's going on?

Kazuki: This guy came in and started saying he wanted to buy the club.

Kiryu: Who are you, anyway?

Hasebe: Name's Hasebe, captain of the Nishikiyama Family. Yknow, the one wrestin' control of this whole damn city.

Kiryu: What?

Hasebe: So look, we just wanna borrow your pal's club for a bit. We're playin' nice now… but you don't wanna see what happens when we don't.

Kiryu: Why do you need the club?

Hasebe: Well that just doesn't even deserve an answer. Now scram, pal. (to Kazuki) So whaddya say? 300 mil's a damn mighty pile o' cash. As I think you can see. And hey, it's just one measly month. That time'll fly by quicker than a bat outta hell.

Kazuki: …I think I know what you want it for. You're going to turn this place into your base of operations for a yakuza war.

Hasebe: Heh. Guess ya don't survive this long in Kamurocho without knowin' how its shadier side operates, huh?

Kazuki: I also know who your target is: the Kazama Family.

Kiryu: What!?

Hasebe: Heh. You're one smart cookie, buddy. But not smart enough to accept our offer. We got other ways of convincin' if ya need that little push.

[A dozen other yakuza run into Stardust. They surround Kiryu.]

Hasebe: Sorry 'bout this, Fourth Chairman-han. Not a spare seat in the house tonight. Gonna have to respectfully ask ya to leave. (bows)

Kiryu: I can't do that. Not before I make you tell me what you're up to.

Hasebe: Well, well. That some kinda threat, Chairman-han? Can't let that slide, y'know.

Kiryu: Sure. If that's how you want to take it.

Hasebe: (smiles) Hear that? He's all yours, boys! Tear these punks to shreds!

[Kiryu kicks the asses of Hasebe and his mutts. Hasebe breaks the money table with his body.]

Hasebe: So… Kazuma Kiryu's a fuckin' beast. No winnin' against that.

Kiryu: Now, I asked you a question. What are you plotting?

Hasebe: The wheels're in motion. Your boy Kashiwagi's gonna die.

Kiryu: What!?

Hasebe: This war's… just gettin' started!

Chapter 5: THE CURTAIN RISES
[Yuya stirs the ice in the whiskey glass with a metal stick and holds it out to Kiryu.]

Yuya: Been what, two years, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Yup. (sips the drink)

Yuya: The drinks haven't tasted half as good without you around. Please, take a load off.

Kiryu: I'm not sure I have time for that.

Yuya: You mean because of what Hasebe said?

Kiryu: Yeah. I'm worried about Kashiwagi-san. I need to get to the Millennium Tower.

[Meanwhile, Kazuki is talking to policemen.]

Policeman: And this is just a simple dispute between two of your hosts?

Kazuki: Yes. My apologies for the trouble, officer. (bows)

Yuya: Just give it a bit. Kazuki'll be done with them soon enough. (to Kazuki) All good?

Kazuki: (approaches) It should be, yes. They seemed to believe me when I told them it was just some of our younger hosts getting a bit too heated.

Kiryu: Good.

Kazuki: Even so, you should stay vigilant. The police are still out front. They'll surely want to question you if you walk out now.

Kiryu: …Guess lI'm stuck here for now, then.

Kazuki: I doubt they'll stick around much longer. Actually. Can you go check on them for us, Yuya?

Yuya: You got it! (leaves)

Kazuki: There's something I need to talk to you about, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: What's that?

Kazuki: It concerns Kamurocho.

Kiryu: Oh?

Kazuki: This city has changed in the two years since you've left, Kiryu-san. Or perhaps it would be better to say the Tojo Clan has changed. More specifically their power structure.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Kazuki: It has to do with the Nishikiyama Family. They've always been… forceful, to say the least. Even with their old bosses Nishikiyama-san and Shindo in charge. But ever since this new guy has taken the reins, their bloodlust has been uncontrollable. They're trying to seize every last shop in Kamurocho, even those under Tojo control.

Kiryu: I can't imagine Kashiwagi-san would take that sitting down.

Kazuki: True enough. But as the captain of the Tojo Clan, he makes it a point to avoid internal conflict whenever possible. Most shops have been able to resist the Nishikiyama advances given their long history with the Kazama Family, but…

Kiryu: But something's changed.

Kazuki: Yes. At first it was just vague threats and attempts at coercion, but it seems recently the Nishikiyama Family's come into a massive sum of money. 

Kiryu: So they're bribing all the holdouts.

Kazuki: Exactly. Their stake in Kamurocho has expanded nearly tenfold over the past year.

Kiryu: And they don't care that their newfound territory's coming from another Tojo family? So much for honor.

Kazuki: Of course, the Kazama Family won't stand by and let their stores be snatched away. Tensions have been extremely high. Nobody's sure what may be the spark that sets off a full-fledged yakuza war… but most people seem to believe it's coming one way or another. More likely than not, that's why the Nishikiyama Family wants our club. To use as their base of operations during that war.

Kiryu: Makes sense. It's not far from the Kazama office over in the Millennium Tower, and it's one of the biggest shops in town.

[Kiryu’s phone rings.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Kashiwagi: Hey. It's Kashiwagi.

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san!

Kashiwagi: I have something urgent to discuss with you. How quickly can you be in Tokyo?

Kiryu: I'm actually already here. In Kamurocho.

Kashiwagi: Really?

Kiryu: Yeah. And I have something to talk about too, Kashiwagi-san.

Kashiwagi: Where are you now?

Kiryu: At Stardust.

Kashiwagi: Stardust? But the cops are crawling all over that place. Did something happen over there?

Kiryu: Yeah. Just a little run-in with the Nishikiyama Family. Don't worry, I handled it. Is everything okay with you, Kashiwagi-san?

Kashiwagi: Why do you ask?

Kiryu: Well, this guy Hasebe from the Nishikiyama Family… He said you're in danger.

Kashiwagi: I see. Then we should meet sooner rather than later. Can you come now, Kiryu?

Kiryu: Yeah. The Kazama Office work for you?

Kashiwagi: Of course, See you soon.

Kiryu: Sounds good.

Kashiwagi: Oh, and as much as it pains me to say, a lot of people out there want you dead. Try to keep a low profile on your way to the Millennium Tower.

Kiryu: I will. Later.

[Hungs up.]

Kiryu: Looks like I'm heading out.

Kazuki: Going to see Kashiwagi-san, I assume?

Kiryu: Yeah.

[Yuya runs in.]

Kazuki: So? How does it look out there?

Yuya: (panting) Well the cops quit hanging around the club… but now they're swarming the Millennium Tower.

Kazuki: That's a problem.

Kiryu: Guess I'll need a way around them.

Yuya: Already have you covered, though it's kinda a pain. First head east toward Nakamichi Street, cross that toward Pink Street, but head up before you reach it. That'll get you into the Millennium Tower without the cops ever even noticing.

Kiryu: Got it.

Kazuki: Kiryu-san. Cops aside, there have been some shady characters around town lately. I suggest you stay on your guard.

Kiryu: What do they look like?

Kazuki: Men in black suits sporting black sunglasses. I hear they're foreigners… Attempting to track down-Daigo Dojima-san.

Kiryu: What?

Kazuki: I'm not sure of the specifics, but it may have something to do with why Daigo-san was shot. Someone has really been pulling out all the stops to find him. 

Kiryu: Probably to see if he's still alive.

Kazuki: I don't really want to entertain this thought, but if Daigo-san truly is gone… Anyone with hopes of becoming the next chairman would be met with some very welcome news. In any case, they're no friends of yours, Kiryu-san. Keep your guard up.

[Kazuki and Yuya bows.]

Kiryu: I will. Thanks.

[He leaves Stardust.]

Go To The Millennium Tower
[Kiryu notices that many streets are blocked by the police.]

Kiryu: (I don't have time to end up in a police interview right now. Gotta find another way.)

Kiryu: (Cops here, too. Gotta find another way.)

[He has to walk through narrow streets to get around police cordons.]

Kiryu: (Hm? Maybe I can slip by them through this alley.)

[However, as soon as he enters the alley he is surrounded by men in black suits.]

Kiryu: Who are you guys? What do you want?

[The men in black look like American intelligence agents. They are led by a man wearing a long cloak, black aviator glasses, and slicked-back hair.]

Kiryu: …Guess you don't speak Japanese. I get it. You're not here to chat. I won't go down easy, though. Sorry… But this might hurt a bit.

[Kiryu fights the men in black, but they prove to be very formidable opponents, especially their leader. Nevertheless, they all end up on the ground.]

Kiryu: Let me guess, you're the ones looking for Daigo. Tell me… Who hired you?

[The leader of the Men in Black takes a gun out of his pocket without a word and points it at Kiryu, but the police sirens sound in the distance and the Men in Black decide to flee.]

Kiryu: (Who were they…? No time to think about that now. Gotta get to the Millennium Tower.)

[He leaves the alley.]

Kiryu: (Hm? A foreigner in a black suit. He must be with those guys I just fought off.) Hey, you there. We need to talk.

Mystery Man: ……

[The mystery man runs away.]

Kiryu: Get back here! (Dammit! I need to know what those guys are up to!)

Chase The Man In Black!
[Not without effort, Kiryu catches up with the man in black and knocks him to the ground.]

Kiryu: (crunching the knuckles) Hey! Are you with those guys from before!?

Man in Black: Wait, don't touch my beautiful face! Go for the meh parts of me… Maybe my forearms? I've always thought they were too skinny. …Wait a sec! Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: You're that guy I met in Okinawa! Mack, right? What are you doing up in Kamurocho?

Mack: Didn't I tell you I was gonna travel the world in search of the perfect shot? Well it just so happens this grimy old town was the first stop on my global getaway! Gotta keep it local before I let the Mack Attack loose on the unsuspecting people of the world, yknow?

Kiryu: …Forget I asked. Why did you run from me?

Mack: Well think about it! I just strolled up to see the most amazing flash of fists break out in some random little alleyway. One lone man versus an entire thug army! My eyes were superglued to that shit, man! So I kept watching, thinking maybe I’d finally snag the perfect shot I've been looking for all these years. But the scuffle was over before my shutter even clicked. Then outta the blue, the guy who kicked those American asses to kingdom come starts coming my way! I was quaking in my goddamn boots! So I ran. Never would've guessed that macho man was you, Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: You, uh… take photos of random street fights? Whatever. It's safe to say you're not working with those guys.

Mack: Me? Of course not, Kiryu-san! I know I've got the scary suit and all, but I wouldn't hurt a fly! Or anything else, for that matter! By the way, you got some legs on you, Kiryu-san! They used to call me the Scampering Chicken on my high school track team, but man you're on a whole 'nother level! Y'know what? I think it's fate that we crossed paths here today. Actually, I'm sure of it! Nothing but the sweet string of destiny could bring us back together. Which reminds me. I got a special place I wanna show you. Interested?

Kiryu: …As long as it's nothing weird.

Mack: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. Let's go! (his phone vibrates) Actually, let's not! It's email time! ……Welp, let's just forget I ever invited you! Buddy of mine in town just asked me out for a drink, and I'm not the kinda guy to say no to a drink. Sorry, gotta jet!

Kiryu: Wait… You have friends?

Mack: Heck yeah I do! This one's a special friend, over in that special place I was telling you about. And hey, I’ve got pals in like 13 different time zones! Anyway, Kiryu-san. I'll roll out the red carpet for you some time, yeah? Catch you later!

[He runs away.]

Kiryu: Uh… (Well he's an… interesting guy. I'm sure I'll run into him again sooner or later. At least he's out of my hair, though. Now to get to the Millennium Tower and meet with Kashiwagi-san.)

[Kiryu goes to Millennium Tower and goes up to Kazama Office. On the wall of the office hangs a sign with characters 義仁. The first one means “righteousness, justice, morality, honor, loyalty” and the second “humanity, virtue, benevolence, charity”.]

Kashiwagi: It's good to see you, Kiryu.

[OSAMU KASHIWAGI. Captain Of The Tojo Clan, Patriarch Of The Kazama Family.]

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san.

Kashiwagi: There's not much time. But I need you to be aware of what's going on.

Kiryu: Right.

Kashiwagi: It concerns today's officers meeting.

[He tells Kiryu about the recent meeting in the Tojo Clan…]

Kanda: (slams his fist on the armrest of the chair) I hear that right! You want the fourth chairman back in the fold!?

[TSUYOSHI KANDA. Patriarch Of The Nishikiyama Family, A Tojo Clan Subsidiary.]

Kashiwagi: That's correct. With the sixth chairman indisposed… the Tojo Clan lacks an anchor to hold us steady. For now we must assume the worst, meaning the only way forward… is finding a satisfactory replacement.

Kanda: The shit?

Man With Dragon Tattoo: I must agree.

[YOSHITAKA MINE. Chairman Of The Hakuho Clan, A Tojo Clan Subsidiary]

Kanda: Mine, you fuckin' dog!

Mine: Kanda-aniki. Asking Kiryu-san to step in makes the most sense at present.

Kanda: Bullshit it does!

Mine: Captain. My oath was sworn to the sixth chairman. In any other circumstance, I'd suggest waiting for Daigo-san's return. But the Omi Alliance is breathing down our necks. Hence, I believe it prudent to find a stopgap. At least until Daigo-san is well enough to rejoin us.

Kashiwagi: Agreed.

Kanda: (throws a cigarette at Mine) Bunch of fuckin' cowards! This is about honor! Not sittin' on your goddamn asses! All those stocks must've melted your brain into mush, Mine!

Yakuza From Chinese Restaurant: I'm with Kanda on this one. The only thing a yakuza should be thinking about… Is getting revenge for their maybe-dying chairman.

[GOH HAMAZAKI. Patriarch Of The Hamazaki Family, A Tojo Clan Subsidiary]

Kashiwagi: Hamazaki!

Hamazaki: Captain. If my sources are right, the man who shot our sixth chairman… Was a dead ringer for the late Shintaro Kazama. Ring any bells?

Kanda: Hamazaki… The shit're you gettin' at!? (to Kashiwagi) The shit is he gettin' at!?

Kashiwagi: According to an aide to the sixth chairman, when Daigo was shot… He was alone in his office with a man who looked like Patriarch Kazama.

Hamazaki: Not like he rose from the grave for this nonsense, though. Someone else must've pulled the trigger. Captain. You don't know who it was, do you?

Kashiwagi: No. Not even the slightest idea.

Hamazaki: You ask me, the best thing for the Tojo right now… Is finding who filled our chairman with lead and figuring out who's gunning for us. We can discuss whether Kiryu-san should return after those are taken care of.

Mine: You're wrong. Solidifying the clan must be our primary course of action. If we fail to recruit Kiryu-san at this vital moment, we risk the entire organization crumbling to pieces.

Kanda: Kiryu, Kiryu, Kiryu, Kiryu. You pricks in love with the guy!? If you're jonesin' for Kiryu that bad… …I'll bring you his goddamn head on a plate!

Kashiwagi: Kanda!

Kanda: And Cap. I got another truth bomb for ya. Ain't a chance in hell the Nishikiyama Family's takin' orders from that waste of life. With what Kiryu did to the top boys before me… the family's takin' a hard stance on this!

Hamazaki: Pretty sure your "hard stance" had you locked up for sex crimes while all that was going down.

Kanda: This ain't a damn joke! The Nishikiyama Family's about ready to slice that backstabbin' bitch in half! I got half a mind to just get it over with and become the next chairman myself! Kiryu's an enemy of the Tojo Clan! I'm gonna tear him limb from limb!

Hamazaki: Afraid I can't let you do that.

Kanda: Oh yeah!?

Hamazaki: By all means, get rid of Kiryu-san. But letting you Nishikiyama brats run the clan? Well that's just not gonna fly. Right, Captain?

Kashiwagi: What are you talking about? This is no time to discuss succession!

Hamazaki: Says the guy pining for Kiryu-san. Neither Kanda nor I want him back, you know.

Kashiwagi: Hamazaki!

Hamazaki: If we ask Kiryu-san to do us a solid now, he might just stick around, become seventh chairman. Can't let that slide. Right, Mine? Wonder what the mute mutt thinks of all this, too.Well, Majima-san?

[The camera shifts and we see that there was another head of the family sitting in the meeting the whole time…]

[GORO MAJIMA. Patriarch Of The Majima Family, A Tojo Clan Subsidiary]

Hamazaki: You're just as much a part of this as we are. Lay it on us.

[Majima sit silently then utters…]

Majima: Morons. Do what ya wanna do. Doesn't matter to me either way.

Kanda: What're you playin' at!?

Majima: Go on your wild ghost chase for Kazama-san… Or have Kiryu-chan bust your skulls open. I just don't give a damn.

[He walks toward the exit.]

Majima: Oh yeah. Before I split. You three can brawl if ya want. But if ya even think of goin' for my turf… (grimly) Kazama-san won't be the only ghost in town.

Kashiwagi: Majima…

Majima: Peace. 

[He leaves the meeting room and exhales.]

Majima: (to himself) Kiryu-chan… The storm's comin' for ya.

[We’re back to Kashiwagi and Kiryu.]

Kiryu: So that's what's going on…

Kashiwagi: It's safe to assume some are already aware that you're back in Kamurocho. Kanda in particular is one to watch for.

Kiryu: Right.

Kashiwagi: For the time being, I expect each family to pursue its own goals. I'll do what I can to keep tabs on Kanda and hopefully track down the man who shot Daigo.

Kiryu: About that. Well…

[He takes Saki's drawing of the Nakahara shooter out of his pocket.]

Kashiwagi: What in the…!?

Kiryu: Last night, the man in this sketch shot the patriarch of the Ryudo Family down in Okinawa. A guy by the name Nakahara.

Kashiwagi: And you're sure this is what the attacker looked like?

Kiryu: I didn't believe it myself at first, but the girl who watched it all go down drew this afterward.

Kashiwagi: Which means the sixth chairman and this Nakahara were assaulted by the same man. The pieces are all falling into place.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Kashiwagi: More likely than not, Daigo's involvement in the Okinawa deal is what led to his being attacked.

Kiryu: You mean the resort?

Kashiwagi: Yes. As you're well aware, the Tojo aided the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transportation in acquiring the land necessary to build Minister Suzuki's proposed resort.

Kiryu: Right, but Daigo told me you guys backed out. That the government was trying to negotiate with the locals instead.

Kashiwagi: They were, but it seems someone else has started scooping up the land. There must be another party involved in all this.

Kiryu: Speaking of, the man in that sketch didn't just shoot Nakahara. He also stole the deed to his land.

Kashiwagi: What!?

Kiryu: I’d bet the man showed up asking for the deed, then put a bullet in Nakahara when he refused to hand it over.

Kashiwagi: Then it's safe to assume the assault on the sixth chairman was for the same reason. Specifically for the land your orphanage rests on, Kiryu.

Kiryu: So Daigo knows who these people are?

Kashiwagi: In all likelihood, yes. The truth of it is, that resort deal could have brought massive cashflow into the Tojo Clan. Minister Suzuki was eager to remind us of that fact at any possible moment. But Daigo was firm in his resolve.

Kiryu: He refused? Why?

Kashiwagi: I think you know. It was because of your orphanage, Kiryu. Once he learned you would be evicted and your kids would lose their home, he washed his hands of the whole thing.

Kiryu: So he put himself in harm's way to keep us safe… Where is he now?

Kashiwagi: Somewhere safe. I checked him into a hospital.

Kiryu: Which one?

Kashiwagi: I think it's best you don't know. I can't have you going there and risk someone following you. You'll just have to trust me for the time being.

Kiryu: …I can do that. How's he doing, though?

Kashiwagi: Balancing on a knife's edge at the moment. The next week or so will determine which way he falls.

Kiryu: Right…

Kashiwagi: One thing, though. If this man really shot both of them… How did he get from Okinawa to Tokyo so quickly?

Kiryu: Nakahara was attacked right around four o'clock yesterday. As for Daigo, it was about six thirty. That leaves a gap of two and a half hours.

Kashiwagi: Which is about how long the flight from Okinawa to Tokyo takes. He wouldn't have had time to get to Tojo HQ from the airport…

[Suddenly the lights go out in the office…]

Kiryu: What the…?

Kashiwagi: Must be a blackout.

[Kashiwagi walks to the window.]

Kashiwagi: Strange. The rest of Kamurocho seems unaffected.

[Suddenly… a helicopter arrives at the building. It turns on a powerful spotlight, blinding Kashiwagi and Kiryu. The door of the helicopter opens and the muzzle of a six-barreled machine gun comes out. The large-caliber bullets pierce the concrete and turn the furniture into splinters. Kiryu barely makes it to the floor. After firing off a clip, the helicopter takes off.]

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san!? Kashiwagi-san!

[Kashiwagi has been shot several times. His clothes and the drawing of Nakahara's shooter are stained with blood. He is barely conscious.]

Kashiwagi: Kiryu… This man… Track down the one working with him.

Kiryu: There's someone else?

Kashiwagi: I'm almost certain. I think they're supporting the Okinawa deal… Trying to push it through. It's someone in the Tojo…

Kiryu: So this person betrayed the clan!?

Kashiwagi: Yes. I need you… to find him. Can you do that?

Kiryu: Of course!

[Osamu Kashiwagi drops the drawing and dies.]

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san? Kashiwagi-san!

[Kiryu holds back tears and anger as he suddenly hears the sirens of police cars approaching… The Millennium Tower is surrounded. Kiryu takes the bloody drawing and runs out of the office.]

Chapter 6: GAMEPLAN
[Kiryu comes out of Millennium Tower. The police have already cordoned off the area and are holding back an influx of onlookers. One policeman notices Kiryu and his bloody jacket. Kiryu also realizes that he looks suspicious to say the least and tries to leave quickly. The policeman turns to him.]

Policeman: Hey, you!

[Kiryu realizes he has to run.]

Policeman: Don’t run! Wait!

[Three policemen run after Kiryu. Dodging bystanders, Kiryu runs as fast as he can.]

Policeman: Stop! I said stop!

[Kiryu breaks away from the chase.]

Kiryu: (Looks like I shook them off. Can't go back that way, though…)

Police Officer: Huh? Hey, you there!

Kiryu: (This is no time to get hauled in by the cops. I’ll have to get away somehow.)

Escaping: Here is the full route. But be careful. The streets are riddled with police officers displayed as pink icons on your minimap. These officers will join the chase as you run by them, so keep on your guard.

Escape The Police
[By moving quickly and jumping over various obstacles, Kiryu manages to escape from the police cordon.]

Policeman 1: Damn, where'd he go…?

Policeman 2: Let's try over there.

Familiar Voice: Looking good.

Kiryu: Who's there? Date-san!

Date: Should've known all this was a Kazuma Kiryu special. We need to talk. How about a drink? For old time's sake. Come on, I've got a little bar I like not too far from here. Well be safe there. Stick close, though. Doubt the cops are gonna just disperse now that they've lost track of you.

Kiryu: Right.

Date: Even if they stop us, though… I should be able to talk my way out of it. Just try not to do anything too suspicious near an officer, okay?

Kiryu: …I'll try.

[Kiryu follows Date. They walk through the streets slowly, trying not to draw attention to themselves.]

Date: This is the place, Kiryu.

Kiryu: Wait…

Date: What, you surprised? Just wait until you see the inside.

[They enter… Serena Bar.]

Serena’s New Mama: Welcome! Oh, Date-san. Not drinking alone tonight?

Date: Not tonight, Mama.

[Date and Kiryu sit down at the bar.]

Kiryu: Date-san, this is…

Date: Yup, Serena's finally back in business. New mama's really spruced the place up, though,

Serena’s New Mama: Date-san. Will you be having the usual?

Date: Sure. And the kid'll be in soon, so fix one up for him, too.

Kiryu: She's pretty young to be owning a bar.

Date: You're telling me. But she's got the guts of a much older woman.

Serena’s New Mama: Who are you calling old? Your drink.

Date: Didn't mean for you to hear that. Mama… you mind stepping out for a bit? My friend and I have some catching up to do.

Serena’s New Mama: Of course, take all the time you need.

Date: This place is practically a second home by now. No chance we'll get found here, don't worry.

Kiryu: But Date-san… How'd you know where I'd be?

Date: Kazuki filled me in. With your track record, I knew it wouldn't be long 'til you were the center of another mess.

[A panting young man enters the bar.]

Date: About time. You got the stuff?

Young Man: Don't say it like that. You make this sound like some kinda drug deal.

Serena’s New Mama: Here, your drink.

Young Man: This stuff's pure alcohol! You trying to poison me, Mama? Splash some water in there!

Serena’s New Mama: Coming right up.

[Young Man passes some documents to Date.]

Date: There it is. Nice work.

Young Man: (finish his drink) Don't pretend you're my boss. Look at me, taking orders from the new guy. I'm a freaking senior editor!

Kiryu: And those are?

Date: Oh. Just a few things for you to look at. These are the five current Tojo Clan officers.

[He puts pictures of Hamazaki, Mine, Kashiwagi, Kanda and Majima on the counter.]

Kiryu: What are you getting at?

Date: Truth of it is, my title's changed a little.

[He holds out his new business card to him. On it we see the following - 京浜新聞社 (Keihin News Paper) 社会部 (Social Department) 記者 (Reporter) 伊 達 真 (Makoto Date).]

Kiryu: Date-san… You're working for a paper?

Date: Yup. Kiryu. This garbage you're dealing with? It all ties back to a story I'm chasing.

Kiryu: What story?

Date: The link between the Tojo Clan and the Okinawa resort Minister Suzuki's so keen on. This fire's getting hot. Let's take some time and go over the key players. Don't want you getting burned. So, where do you wanna start?

Tsuyoshi Kanda ✓
Yoshitaka Mine
Goh Hamazaki

Date: This cue ball here is the third patriarch of the Nishikiyama Family Guy by the name of Kanda.

Kiryu: Nishikiyama…

Date: Yup. Same group of thugs you took down three years ago.

Kiryu: I don't think I've ever met this one, though.

Date: Not surprising. He got tossed in jail for two years on sexual assault charges. Guys like him only care about two things: babes and brawls. When Nishikiyama was still heading the family, this chump would've been the guy who polished his shoes.

Kiryu: So how's he end up patriarch?

Date: Once he was a free man, he started expanding his share of the turf in Kamurocho. Mostly by brute force. Would've been two years back, right after all that business with Ryuji Goda and the Omi. Guy came onto the scene right as the police started backing off from the Tojo. Perfect timing, too. Wasn't long until he'd snapped up practically all the Kazama Family's territory.

Kiryu: And what's he after?

Date: Tojo chairmanship, if I had to guess. He won't be giving up on that dream without a fight, either. Women, land… He'll stop at nothing to get what he wants, It's all about power with this guy.

Kiryu: Then… is it possible he's the one who shot Kashiwagi-san?

Date: Chances are high, yeah. Who's next?

Tsuyoshi Kanda 
Yoshitaka Mine ✓
Goh Hamazaki

Date: This is the chairman of the Hakuho Clan. Yoshitaka Mine.

Kiryu: Yoshitaka Mine…

Date: One of those new-money types who's got more than he knows what to do with. Spends most of his time downtown. Often seen driving flashy foreign cars. Day in the life of a young, rich businessman. From the sounds of it, most of his fortune sprung out of insider trading, with a little on the side coming from real estate. The guy's essentially white-collar yakuza. 

Kiryu: Huh.

Date: He's also the one providing the Tojo Clan with practically all their funding. As I said, he's loaded. Most of that aid's been going to Kanda from the Nishikiyama Family, though.

Kiryu: How does a guy like this end up working with Kanda?

Date: He wasn't, at first. Up until a few years ago, Mine was little more than your run-of-the-mill venture capitalist. Seems Kanda's the one who convinced him to join up. With ties like that, it wasn't long 'til Mine was swearing an oath with Daigo Dojima and the Tojo Clan.

Kiryu: So Kanda and Mine are in league, then.

Date: Nah, Mine's loyal to the sixth chairman. With how beefy his own ranks have grown lately, he doesn't need Kanda's muscle anymore. If anything I'd say he's distancing himself from Kanda. Who’s next?

Tsuyoshi Kanda 
Yoshitaka Mine 
Goh Hamazaki ✓

Date: This amateur porn star wannabe is a guy most people know as the Emperor of Hama. Goh Hamazaki, patriarch of the Hamazaki Family.

Kiryu: By Hama, you mean Yokohama, right?

Date: Yup. After the Snake Flower Triad got pushed out of town in the conflict three years ago, Hamazaki arrived on the scene and made it his own. This guy's a tough nut to crack, though. For some reason he stayed buddy-buddy with the Chinese mafia whose turf he snatched.

Kiryu: The Snake Flower Triad…

Date: Mhm. That's not the only thing raising eyebrows, either. Turns out, his family's only got ten guys on their books.

Kiryu: What?

Date: I know. You'd think a guy taking on the Snake Flower Triad on their home field would need at least 500, or even 1,000 boys backing him up. But he waltzed into town and claimed ownership without ever even lifting a finger. 

Kiryu: How is that possible?

Date: If I had to guess, I'd say he's been working behind the scenes with the Chinese mafia. Smuggling illegal goods into the country for them, laundering their money. You know. Wouldn't be surprised if it turned out they were using him, though. 

Kiryu: So he's working with the mafia…

Date: Hard to say for sure, but if all this Tojo stuff ties back to that Okinawa resort deal, I'd bet Hamazaki was first in line drafting the blueprints.

Kiryu: Meaning he and his Chinese hookups are looking for a slice of the pie.

Date: Probably so they can set up a casino there. Either above board or otherwise.

Kiryu: Kashiwagi-san told me something before he died. He said someone's trying to push the resort deal through. Someone in the Tojo Clan.

Date: Then he was right. And the only four Tojo boys who could pull it off… are right in front of you.

Kiryu: That wasn't the only thing Kashiwagi-san said. He told me the traitor is working with the man who shot Daigo.

Date: You know who pulled the trigger!?

[Kiryu shows him the bloodstained drawing.]

Kiryu: And it wasn't just Daigo. The man who owns the land they want to build the resort on, Nakahara. They shot him, too.

Date: Is this some kinda sick joke? Kazama-san's gone! How is this possible?

Kiryu: I'm not sure it's really him. But we have this man, who put bullets in both Daigo and Nakahara. The foreigners in black suits. And that helicopter attack. Who are we up against here…?

Date: Doesn't matter. All we can do now is weed out the traitor in the Tojo Clan.

Kiryu: Agreed.

Date: I'll try digging up some dirt on this guy in the sketch. You track down the one who probably offed Kashiwagi… Kanda.

Kiryu: Okay.

Date: We settled? I’ll dig around for anything on the man in this sketch, you get after Kanda.

Kiryu: Right.

Date: Rumor has it, Kanda gets his boys to haul a girl up to his hotel room every night. If anyone's gonna know where to find him, it's them. Mama, you mind if we use your bar as a sorta base of operations?

Mama: Hm?

Date: Don't worry, we won't disrupt your business or anything. Just stick us in a back room and forget we even exist. Well, Mama?

Mama: Hmmm. I guess you are one of my best customers… Oh, what the heck. Go ahead.

Date: Appreciate it, Mama.

Mama: Just stay out of my customers' hair, okay?

Date: Of course, of course.

Kiryu: Sorry about this, Mama.

Mama: Oh, it's nothing. This is the least I can do with how often Date-san frequents my bar. It's rare you don't see him in here, glass of whisky in hand!

Date: Hmph.

Mama: Besides, Kiryu-san, You're kinda my type.

Date: Your what!?

Wakazo (Young Man): Do I hear a tinge of jealousy in your voice, Date-san?

Date: Don't be ridiculous!

Mama: Aww, you're blushing!

Date: Kiryu! Can you please just go find Kanda already?

Kiryu: Heh. Don't let them bully you while I'm gone.

[He leaves the bar.]

Find Kanda
[Kiryu phone’s ringing.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Rikiya: It's Rikiya. I'm real pissed at you, Aniki!

Kiryu: Sorry, Rikiya. I never should have said you could come. So, what's up? Did something happen down there?

Rikiya: No, that's not why I'm calling.

Kiryu: Hm? Then what is it?

Rikiya: Well… I'm in Kamurocho.

Kiryu: What? Why!?

Rikiya: I know you wanted me to stay in Okinawa, Aniki… But I wasn't gonna just sit by while you went n' found the bastard who shot the boss!

Kiryu: Rikiya…

Rikiya: Oh, and I left Mikio in charge of the orphanage. The kids’ll be fine with him, don't worry.

Kiryu: (I guess as long as someone's looking after them…)

Rikiya: Sorry, Aniki. I know you were just tryin' to protect me.

Kiryu: It's okay, Rikiya. I'm sorry for just leaving you there in the dark.

Rikiya: Aniki…

Kiryu: More importantly. Where are you?

Rikiya: Huh? I, uh… Well. I don't got the slightest idea.

Kiryu: What? Surely you can figure out what street you're on. And… you didn't think to get a map before you showed up here?

Rikiya: Not really. I can't tell up from down in this friggin' place. It's like a maze.

Kiryu: And… you didn't think to get a map before you showed up here?

Rikiya: Sorry.

Kiryu: It's all right, I'll be there as soon as I can. In the meantime, try and find a landmark to wait at.

Rikiya: What, ya mean like a tall buildin' or something?

Kiryu: Anything that stands out. Let me know once you have a place.

Rikiya: Gotcha!

Kiryu: Talk to you later, Rikiya.

Rikiya: Yup!

[Kiryu receives an email from Rikiya.]

Rikiya here! 👍
Rikiya
Aniki! There's a huge building up the street! Wow, that thing's freaking massive!
Never seen one so big! Now know I'm really in Tokyo! ^^
The street Im on has lots of stores.
----END----

Kiryu: (The building he's talking about is probably the Millennium Tower. He also mentioned a street with a lot of stores…)

Must be Nakamichi Street.
Totally Taihei Boulevard. ✓

Kiryu: (Guess I'll try the west end of Taihei Boulevard.)

Kiryu: (Taichi's calling… Hope everything's okay.)

Taichi: Hello, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Hey, Taichi. Everything all right down there?

Taichi: Oh yeah, everything's fine!

Kiryu: So what's with the phone call, then?

Taichi: Oh, come on, can't I just give you a call now and then? It doesn't always have to be for emergencies!

Kiryu: Fair enough. Are you eating okay?

Taichi: Geez, you worry too much about us, Uncle Kaz. Of course I am!

Kiryu: All right, then. So, what's the matter?

Taichi: Well, I was wondering how long it's gonna be till you come home.

Kiryu: I'm not exactly sure. Maybe a few days?

Taichi: Ooh, in that case, can you pick something up for me before you leave Kamurocho?

Kiryu: That depends on what you want.

Taichi: Wellllll, could you get me the newest issue of Five?

Kiryu: Five? You mean Shonen Five?

Taichi: Yup, that's the one! I'm surprised you knew what it was, Uncle Kaz. Usually you're pretty clueless about stuff like that.

Kiryu: Hey, Shonen Five's pretty mainstream.

Taichi: Anyway, I want you to get me the latest issue.

Kiryu: The one out this week?

Taichi: Yeah! They're announcing the winners of the Shonen Five Awards in this issue! I'm super pumped!

Kiryu: Hold on. Don't they sell that magazine in Okinawa, too? Why don't you buy it yourself? This is the kind of stuff I give you allowance for, Taichi.

Taichi: I can’t!

Kiryu: Taichi.

Taichi: I'm serious! It's out in Tokyo, but it's not out in Okinawa. Not yet!

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Taichi: Wait, don't you know? They always release stuff later here than on the mainland!

Kiryu: …Right.

Taichi: Anyway, I just gotta know what happens next! I even pay you back when you get here! Please, just get me one!

Kiryu: (Guess it wouldn't hurt to swing by a convenience store and take a look.)

[Kiryu comes to Taihei Boulevard.]

Kiryu: (No sign of Rikiya…)

[He receives another email.]

Rikiya here! 👍
Rikiya
Finally found a good landmark! A convenience store!
I'm out in front of it now!
----END----

Kiryu: (A convenience store? That's a pretty vague clue to go by…)

It's gotta be the Tenkaichi Street Poppo.
It's the Nakamichi Street Poppo, no doubt.
Something tells me it's the Showa Street Poppo. ✓
Maybe the Shichifuku Street M Store.

Kiryu: (Something tells me it's the Showa Street Poppo. Guess ll give it a try.)

[But… there’s no Rikiya in the store.]

Kiryu: (No sign of Rikiya…)

[He receives another email.]

Rikiya here! 👍
Rikiya
Where are you, Aniki?
----END----

Kiryu: (I'm not too fond of this wild Rikiya chase. I’ll just have to try somewhere else.)

It's gotta be the Tenkaichi Street Poppo.
It's the Nakamichi Street Poppo, no doubt. ✓
Maybe the Shichifuku Street M Store.

Kiryu: (It's the Nakamichi Street Poppo, no doubt about it.)

[But… there’s no Rikiya in the store.]

Kiryu: (No sign of Rikiya…)

[He receives another email.]

Rikiya here! 😿
Rikiya
Where are you, Aniki? I'm getting tired of waiting…
----END----

Kiryu: (I'm not too fond of this wild Rikiya chase. I’ll just have to try somewhere else.)

It's gotta be the Tenkaichi Street Poppo. ✓
Maybe the Shichifuku Street M Store.

Kiryu: (It's gotta be the Tenkaichi Street Poppo. Guess I'll head over.)

[But… there’s no Rikiya in the store, either!!!]

Kiryu: (No sign of Rikiya…)

[He receives another email.]

Rikiya here! 😾
Rikiya
Where are you, Anikil!? You're not blowing me off, are you!?
----END----

Kiryu: (The M Store's the one place I haven't checked…)

[But… there’s no Rikiya in the store… this was the last place.]

Kiryu: (…He's not here, either. I could've sworn this would be right.)

[He’s phone ringing.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Rikiya: Aniki! It’s Rikiya!

Kiryu: Where the heck are you? I've looked all over town.

Rikiya: Look, there's some serious shit goin' down here, Aniki! These creepos are tryin' to nab some lady in a park!

Kiryu: I’ll be there soon. Just don't do anything too—

Rikiya: I'm not gonna sit around and let 'em snatch this girl! I'm goin' in, Aniki!

Kiryu: —rush.

Rikiya: *beep * beep * beep*

Kiryu: …… (He must be at Children's Park. I've gotta hurry!)

[He approaches the park.]

Yakuza: These're our stompin' grounds, asshole! Now step aside and hand us the girl!

[Rikiya protects a girl from a bunch of yakuzas.]

Yakuza: We don't got time for your bullshit heroics.

[Kiryu enters.]

Yakuza: The hell are you, huh?

Rikiya: Aniki!

Kiryu: Sorry. I heard yelling, so I had to come check it out.

Yakuza: Should've gone the other way, pal. Now turn around before we make you!

Kiryu: This is the girl? The one they were trying to take?

Rikiya: Yup. They wouldn't stop, even after she refused.

Kiryu: Is that so?

Yakuza: Who. Gives. A shit? Nothin' you can do about it, anyway. We're un-freakin'-stoppable! (touches his pin)

Kiryu: What's that supposed to mean?

Yakuza: It means, fix your eyes on this!

[The yakuza has a cufflink on his jacket with the character 錦, which means "Nishiki.” By the way, it translates to "fine dress, honors."]

Kiryu: …So you're Nishikiyama Family, huh?

Nishino: Heh, damn right we are! Well? Those big britches of yours feelin' a little tighter now?

Kiryu: …Not exactly. You guys are just small-time street thugs.

Nishino: We're what!?

Kiryu: Nice work, Rikiya.

Rikiya: Uh… Whaddya mean, Aniki?

Kiryu: These are just the guys I was looking for.

Nishino: What're you two babblin' about over there, huh!?

Kiryu: I’ll explain later, Rikiya. There's a fly buzzing in my ear that I’d really like to swat.

Rikiya: Lemme help, at least! I'm the one they were messin' with in the first place, y'know.

Kiryu: Fine by me. The more the merrier.

Nishino: You think you're hot shit, scumball!?

Kiryu: Hmph. You bottom-rungers never change, do you?

Nishino: What was that!?

Kiryu: All you do is hide behind your family crest like it's some kind of shield. But it's not. You're not tough. You're small.

Nishino: Oh yeah!? I'm bigger than you, fuckface!

Kiryu: Then prove it.

[Kiryu and Rikiya kick their asses.]

Nishino: Urgh… No more…

Kiryu: What, already? Guess the Nishikiyama Family crest is too heavy for you after all.

Nishino: Hrgh…

Rikiya: The hell were you thinkin' trying to kidnap this girl!? What happened to yakuza having pride, huh!?

Nishino: Look, it's not what you're thinking! 0ur boss just sent us out on the prowl for the biggest girl we could find, and—

Rikiya: Whaddya mean “big”? This girľ’s tiny…

Kiryu: That aside, what was Kanda planning to do to her?

Nishino: Well, uh… He needed the girl for his hobby.

Rikiya: You callin' sexual assault a hobby!? The fuck is wrong with you!?

Nishino: Please, just hear me out! The boss's got this weird fetish, see… He has us drag girls back to the office so he can massage them! It's nothing more than that, I promise!

Rikiya: Is this some kinda joke?

Nishino: No, I'm totally for real! The boss loves nothing more than massaging a nice, big woman! The thicker, the better!

Rikiya: You believin' this garbage, Aniki?

Kiryu: What does Kanda get out of all that?

Nishino: I dunno, aroused? I get kinda sick if I dwell on it too much, but I bet he loves hearing 'em moan while he does it. Our only job is finding girls big enough to handle his massive, meaty hands.

Rikiya: And that's why you were trying to kidnap her?

Nishino: Yeah, that's it! I swear! Nothing assault-y about it, promise!

Rikiya: You realize that's still assault, right? Anyway, whaddya think, Aniki? Should we believe him?

Kiryu: Hard to say… but I doubt anyone would make up such an embarrassing story. Especially about their own boss.

Nishino: We're just following orders, honest. Truth is, just thinking of the boss and his hobby makes me wanna hurl to high heavens, but if he says we get a girl, we get a girl.

Kiryu: …All right. We'll let you go this time.

Nishino: Whoa, you mean it!?

Kiryu: Under one condition. Tell us where Kanda is.

Nishino: What're you gonna do to him?

Kiryu: That's none of your business.

Nishino: Urgh… 

Kiryu: Now come on. We're in a hurry here.

Nishino: All right, all right. He's in the Hotel District, little place called the Red Brick.

Kiryu: …Right.

Rikiya: So if I'm gettin' this right, he asked you to haul a girl over to this love hotel so he could… massage her?

Nishino: That's about the thick of it. Sounded like the boss was real happy 'bout something, too. Guess things're going good. That's why he's going all out today for a hotel room instead of just bringing 'em to the office like normal.

Kiryu: …What room is he in?

Nishino: It's, uh… 403.

Kiryu: Got it, room 403 at the Red Brick Hotel. And you're sure that's right?

Nishino: Yup.

Kiryu: Then go. We're done with you.

[The thugs run away in fear.]

Rikiya: (to the girl) Hey, you okay?

Woman: I think so, thanks. If you hadn't come when you did, I would have been in for a pretty rough massage… Though you know, my shoulders have actually been kinda sore lately. Maybe I should've gone with them, hehe!

Rikiya: Uh…

Woman: Anyway, thanks. I really appreciate you stepping in when you did.

Rikiya: Nah, it was nothin'. Any guy would've done the same.

Woman: I'm not so sure about that. By the way, um… could I have your contact info? I was thinking maybe I could pay you back later, if that's all right.

Rikiya: Oh, uh! You don't gotta do that, ma'am! Be glad to give you my name, though—it's Rikiya.

Kiryu: We need to get moving here. (leaves)

Rikiya: Hey, wait a sec, Aniki! Sorry, guess I gotta run. Keep yourself safe, ya hear? Anikiii! Wait up!

[On the streets…]

Kiryu: (Kanda's at the Red Brick Hotel, room 403. We've gotta get in there before he leaves.)

Kiryu: All right, Rikiya. Next stop is the Red Brick to find Kanda. I'm hoping he'll be willing to talk, but we need to be ready for anything in there. Sounds like he doesn't like me very much.

Rikiya: There it is, Anikil! Let's get inside!

Kiryu: Right!

Rikiya: By the way… what'd this Kanda guy do anyway?

Kiryu: A few hours ago, someone shot up the Kazama Family office and murdered Kashiwagi-san, the captain of the Tojo Clan.

Rikiya: What!?

Kiryu: But before he breathed his last words, Kashiwagi-san had something to tell me: there's a traitor in the Tojo Clan. More likely than not, Kanda is that traitor.

Rikiya: Oh…

Kiryu: This is no time to talk, though. Come on.

Rikiya: Right behind you, Aniki!

[They enter the hotel.]

Receptionist: Hold your horses there! You know this isn't a normal hotel, right? It's couples only in here.

Rikiya: Huh!?

Kiryu: What is she talking about?

Receptionist: You two aren't the most reputable looking characters, y'know. Can't have some thugs up and committing crimes in one of my rooms.

Rikiya: I, uh… guess people only come here for one thing. (got an idea and smiles) 'Scuse me, ma'am? We've gotta be a couple to come in, right?

[He pretends that he and Kiryu are a gay couple. Rikiya grabs Kiryu’s arm.]

Receptionist: No couple, no room.

Rikiya: Well, ain't a duo in town cuter than me and my aniki here! ♪

Kiryu: Hold on…!

Rikiya: We usually keep it under wraps, but I just can't keep my hands off of him!

Receptionist: Ohhh! I had no idea! In that case, just a sec. 401's the only room open. It's a tight squeeze, but no worry there!

Rikiya: Appreciate it! ♪

Receptionist: The elevator's just in the back there. Enjoy!

[Kiryu and Rikiya go to the elevator.]

Rikiya: Kanda's on the fourth floor, too.

Kiryu: Yup.

Rikiya: Kinda run-down place for the patriarch of a major family, huh?

Kiryu: I dunno. Maybe he's just not too keen on spending his own money. (Rikiya is still holding his arm) Can you quit it with that already?

[They found room 403.]

Rikiya: This is the place. (knocks)

Kanda: What took ya so long, sweetheart? Who the shit're you!?

Kiryu: Think you can spare us a minute? You don't seem too busy in here.

Kanda: Who's askin’?

Kiryu: The Tojo Clan fourth chairman. Kazuma Kiryu.

Kanda: (shocked) What the…!? Good seein' ya, Fourth Chairman. What brings ya 'round these parts?

Kiryu: There's something we need to ask—

[Kanda dashes off, pushing Kiryu and Rikiya aside!]

Kanda: Help! They're gonna skin me alive!

[Kanda runs around the corner and disappears. Some thugs get in the way of Kiryu and Rikiya.]

Kiryu: Dammit, Kanda… Did he go up or down?

Rikiya: Aniki. I'll check downstairs after we smack these guys around. You head up, okay?

Kiryu: Will do.

Find Kanda (Again)
[They defeat Kanda’s thugs.]

Rikiya: Leave the downstairs to me, Aniki. You go see if he went up.

Kiryu: All right. Stay safe, Rikiya. (Dammit! Where'd he run off to now? Looks like he headed for the back stairs…)

[After an endless run through the corridors, Kiryu corners Kanda into a luxury suite… Kanda hides in the pool and as soon as Kiryu gets closer, Kanda jumps out of it and starts choking Kiryu.]

Kanda: Why's the fourth chairman crashin' my shindig!?

Kiryu: (thrown Kanda) What do you think you're doing?

Kanda: Like to ask ya the same thing! I went all floppy 'cause of you, asshole!

Kiryu: Well then. Looks like a friendly chat's not on the table anymore. Fine. Guess I'll have to beat the answers out of you.

Kanda: Try it! You're gonna regret ever crossin' paths with me! I'm bringin' the heat, Fourth Chairman!

[There is a heated battle between Kiryu and Kanda. At one point, Kanda even rips a stone ornament from the wall and tries to hit Kiryu with it, but he dodges it. The fight ends on the bed, gachimuchi style.]

Kiryu: Now then. Tell me what you know.

Kanda: I don't got answers for ya!

Kiryu: Don't be ridiculous. You can't expect me to fall for that. You're the ones who murdered Kashiwagi-san. Aren't you!?

Kanda: Fuck no! What would I gain outta bumpin' the captain off!?

Kiryu: You want to be the next Tojo chairman. So you made a job opening.

Kanda: Ya got it wrong! Just hear me out! The… The guy who offed the captain… It was Hamazaki!

Kiryu: Hamazaki?

Kanda: Bingo! He's aimin' to control all of Kamurocho! Guy had a motive for axing Kashiwagi!

Kiryu: Explain.

Kanda: He's got a whole army holed up in Yokohama! Just waitin' for a chance to strike! It's the truth! Chinese guy we nabbed in our territory told us! Totally spilled the beans!

Rikiya: Aniki!

Kiryu: Everything okay with you?

Rikiya: More or less. There were a lot of 'em, so it kinda took a while…

Kanda: I'm gonna run ya through!

[However, Kiryu kicks the knife out of Kanda's hands with a long kick and knocks him out.]

Rikiya: This… is Kanda?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Rikiya: Hold up. What happened to askin' him stuff?

Kiryu: I got what I need. Besides, there's no way he planned all this. I doubt he even knows why Daigo got shot in the first place.

Rikiya: Jeez. Tokyo's a scary place, huh?

Kiryu: Rikiya. I promise you. I'll figure out who shot Nakahara. So do me a favor. Go back to Okinawa and—

Rikiya: (strictly) Not happenin'!

Kiryu: Rikiya…

Rikiya: I need to track down the guy who attacked Patriarch Nakahara. I need revenge! (bows) So please, Aniki! Let me stay in Tokyo! I'm beggin' you!

Kiryu: All right. But I have one condition. If you come across the man in the sketch, don't go after him on your own. Can you promise me that?

Rikiya: Yeah.

Kiryu: Good. Now, how about we grab a drink? I can show you the sights. I'll prove this town's not as scary as you think.

[They exit the hotel.]

Kiryu: All right, Rikiya. Where to?

Rikiya: Aniki, uh… I do wanna go sightseein' and all, but you think we can grab some grub first? Fighting always puts a hole in my stomach like none other.

Kiryu: Heh, sure. You have anything in mind?

Rikiya: Heck yeah I do! Yakiniku!

Kiryu: Sure you don't want something a little more… local? You can get yakiniku whenever you want down in Okinawa.

Rikiya: Well yeah, but there's this one Korean joint I've been dyin' to go to. It's the one they always show on the tube, where all the celebrities hang out and stuff their faces!  I heard people even saw the Korean mega-star II Yu-Jin chillin' there a few years back!

Kiryu: That… does sound familiar. I'm not sure if it's the same place, but I have a restaurant in mind. Let's go.

Rikiya: You're the best, Aniki!

[They go to the fancy Korean place called 韓来.]

Rikiya: So this is the place… Wonder if there are any stars in there! Get enough in one room and you got a whole damn constellation!

Kiryu: Guess we won't know until we go in. Come on.

Rikiya: Yeah!

[They go into the restaurant and sit down at a table. The waiter comes up to them.]

Rikiya: I don't see any celebrities. Hell, there aren't even any other people in here…

Kiryu: Hey, you can't expect it to be packed all the time. Come on, let's order.

It's my treat, so get whatever you want. ✓
Oh, and we're splitting the bill.

Kiryu: It's my treat, so get whatever you want.

Rikiya: Whoa, really!? Thanks a ton, Aniki! Alright, let's go with two beers, some kalbi, some sirloin, an order of salted tongue, a plate of tripe… and oh, some Iberico pork while you're at it!

Kiryu: Uh, Rikiya…

Rikiya: Oh yeah, and make all that a double portion for me and my aniki here! Then I'll have a kimchi combo and a kalbi soup on top of that, and some nice chilled noodles for dessert! You want some soup, too, Aniki? I don't think my stomach can fit all that…

Rikiya: By the way, Aniki. I was strollin' around town for a while before we met up. Sure are a lot of interesting folks here in Kamurocho, huh? Weirdos, businessmen, schoolgirls…

Kiryu: Yeah. You could just spend an entire year peoplewatching and never run out of new subjects. Makes you wonder how their lives all led up to this point, converging in this city.

Rikiya: Totally. Wonder if I can find what I'm after here…

Kiryu: What are you talking about?

Rikiya: C'mon, Aniki. We talked about this right after you beat the human stuffing outta me. I'm looking for a guy to finish my viper tattoo, remember?

Kiryu: Right, sorry. Your other tattoo artist died before he could finish it, didn't he?

Rikiya: Mhm. I don't wanna trust my viper to anyone who doesn't get what the spirit of Okinawa's all about… But I'm kinda startin' to think someone here might have what it takes. Guy who's lived in Kamurocho, seen all sortsa people come n' go, even if they're not from Okinawa… I bet he could get what I'm goin' for. Whaddya think, Aniki?

Kiryu: Well… I might just know someone who can help.

Rikiya: For real? Can we go see him!? If we got the time, I mean.

Kiryu: Sure, why not? But let's do some sightseeing first. All we've done so far is sit in this restaurant…

Rikiya: Totally! Let's get a move on!

[At the checkout…]

Rikiya: Man, Aniki! That was like a party in my mouth!

Kiryu: …I guess you could put it that way.

Employee: Your total comes out to 65,000 yen, sir. (about $570)

[Kiryu pays.]

Rikiya: Thanks a lot, Aniki!

Kiryu: Of course.

[They exit the restaurant.]

Kiryu: (Well, that was filling. Now what?)

Continue Exploring with Rikiya
Go Your Separate Ways ✓

Kiryu: Sorry Rikiya, but I think we're gonna have to go our separate ways for tonight.

Rikiya: What, already? You got somewhere to be, Aniki?

Kiryu: Sort of.

Rikiya: Huh. Well, whatevs! I'm gonna keep scopin' out the town if you don't mind. Not every day I get to spend time in Tokyo!

Kiryu: Think you can manage on your own?

Rikiya: Oh, totally! I got a pretty good feel for the layout by now.

Kiryu: Heh, if you say so. By the way, there's a bar called New Serena over on Tenkaichi Street that we're gonna be using as our base of operations. Head there when you're done wandering. And feel free to give me a call if you have trouble finding it.

Rikiya: (bows) Will do. Catch ya later, Aniki! By the way, Aniki, Here's a little thank you for showin' me around. Well, later!

[Rikiya leaves. Kiryu's phone begins to ring.]

Kirui: Hello?

Date: Kiryu? It's me. How'd things go with old baldy?

Kiryu: I found him. He was horrible all right, but he's pretty small time. I don't think he has the wit to outsmart Kashiwagi-san.

Date: Dammit. And here I thought we had a lead.

Kiryu: Guess we weren't as close as we thought. Anyway, I’ll fill you in when I get back. You over at Serena?

Date: Yup, Mama said we can use it whenever we want. Just meet me over here, okay?

Kiryu: Sure, see you soon.

Date: Try not to get too distracted on your way here.

[Kiryu runs to New Serena trying not to be distracted by sub-stories!]

Date: Oh, Kiryu. Feel like you've been gone for hours. You have trouble finding Kanda or something?

Kiryu: That was part of it. But also…

Date: Also what?

Kiryu: Mama, you mind if a friend I brought up from Okinawa stays here with me? They won't be around any longer than I am.

Mama: Oh, of course. Is this a, erm, "special" friend…?

Date: Nah, you've gotta be talking about Haruka, right?

Kiryu: No on both counts. It's actually the captain of the Ryudo Family, one of the biggest syndicates in Okinawa.

Date: And we're definitely talking about a guy here, right? Or did you go and hook yourself some bigshot female yakuza?

Kiryu: His name's Rikiya, He's still pretty much just a kid.

Mama: Oho, well in that case he's especially welcome! We could use some young blood to freshen up the place. All I normally get in here is middle-aged farts like Date-san.

Date: What's that supposed to mean!?

Mama: Hehe, just giving you a taste of your own medicine! That's what you get for calling me an old lady all the time!

Date: …Well, guess I deserve that.

Mama: Anyway, you guys are welcome to stay in the back office so long as you don't cause any trouble in here. I mostly just use it for storage.

Kiryu: I appreciate it, Mama.

Date: So… where is this guy?

Kiryu: I let him go explore Kamurocho a bit, see the sights. He's coming here when he's done.

Date: Sounds like a damn tourist. So much for work ethic.

Mama: Everything okay, Date-san? It doesn't sound like you're in a very good mood.

Date: Nah, it's nothing.

[Rikiya enters the bar.]

Rikiya: Finally found ya, Aniki! Would you believe I went in like five different bars before I ended up here? This city's a goddamn maze or somethin'!

Date: This your guy, Kiryu?

Kiryu: Yup. Rikiya, this is my friend Date-san. I couldn't tell you how many times he's helped me over the years. Oh, and this is the mama of this bar.

Rikiya: (bows) Aniki's friends, huh? Pleasure meetin' you! The name's Rikiya Shimabukuro!

Mama: Well someone has a lot of energy, hehe!

Rikiya: I try, ma'am!

Date: Hmph. It's Date. Pleased.

Rikiya: (bows) Oh, the honor's all mine!

Kiryu: Rikiya. You finished looking around town?

Rikiya: I mean I guess, but…

Kiryu: What's wrong?

Rikiya: I never found that bikini bar I was lookin' for. I really wanted to see what kinda heat a Tokyo one could bring, too…

Kiryu: (I didn't realize it was that important to him…)

Date: Anyway, Kiryu. I'm ready to hear what went down with Kanda whenever you're ready to spill it. Just let me know when it's time, okay? I wanna really dig into the details here. You ready to talk, Kiryu?

Not just yet, sorry.
Let's talk. ✓

Kiryu: Let’s talk.

Date: Great. So, tell me what happened with Kanda.

Kiryu: Well…

Chapter 7: THE MAD DOG
[A richly decorated office. Hamazaki is sitting in a chair and talking on the phone.]

Hamazaki: Oh yeah? Got it. You did good.

[He puts the phone on the table and speaks to the invisible interlocutor.]

Hamazaki: Sounds like Kanda got a nice little visit from the fourth chairman. Whole family's gone up in flames. Impressive he did it all single-handedly. But I suppose the Dragon of Dojima's still got some bite in him.

[Hamazaki opens an expensive cigarette case, takes out a cigarillo and lights up.]

Hamazaki: It's safe to say Kiryu-san'll keep poking around this Okinawa business. By now the guy's probably long known you're wrapped up in the whole shebang, too. Meaning the next place he'll show… is right at your feet. I brought you into this Okinawa deal. So I guess it's my fault if he comes after you. But it's worth it for you. Building this resort'll net your family an easy 100 bil. Just so happens that also makes you the key suspect in the sixth chairman's shooting.

[We see the face of the person he is talking to close up.]

Hamazaki: …Majima-san. I want Kamurocho all to myself. So. You know what has to be done. You've got the most to lose if Kiryu-san gets in our way, after all. Doesn't matter how you do it. Just do it. Or your head's the one that'll roll.

[Hamazaki leaves Majima’s Office. Goro himself didn't even flinch a muscle. We’re back to New Serena. Rikiya, who is drunk, is sleeping on the bar and mumbling something. Kiryu looks at the bloodstained drawing. Date and Wakazo enter the bar.]

Date: Kiryu! We just caught wind of a big story!

Wakazo: Showed up in the evening news.

[He throws Kiryu the fresh issue of their newspaper. The following can be read on it - 京浜新聞 (Keihin Newspaper) 沖縄基地拡大法案可決人 (Okinawa base expansion bill could pass) 在日米軍基地再編 防衛大臣、民事党と合意 (Realignment of U.S. Bases in Japan: Defense Minister Agrees with Civil Party).]

Wakazo: Our politico team’s been working hard to crack this. Tamiya from the Ministry of Defense finally agreed to terms with the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly.

Kiryu: In other words, the military expansion he's been pushing for is a done deal. But the base and the resort are two halves of the same whole. If one starts picking up steam, the other's bound to come with it.

Wakazo: Guess that explains why the resort's been back in the public eye all of a sudden.

Date: Oh, and Kiryu. There's something you might wanna know about the players in this resort deal. 

Wakazo: This tip found its way to our news desk. It's a photo, sent from an anonymous source.

[He hands a picture to Kiryu.]

Kiryu: No…

[In the picture Majima is talking to Suzuki.]

Date: Suzuki's moving ahead with his resort one way or another. And the ones secretly tapped for construction? None other than the Majima Family. Have to say, I never thought Majima would be mixed up in all this. Even with his reputation.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Date: Not sure if he's the one leading the charge, but he's definitely involved. You think maybe he shot Daigo and Kashiwagi?

Kiryu: No. There's no chance.

Date: Look, Kiryu. I know you two are pals and all, but a yakuza who's your friend is still a yakuza. And Majima especially. Let that dog off his leash and who knows what’ll happen.

Kiryu: You're wrong. Majima-san promised me he'd look after Daigo. And he's not the promise breaking type, I trust him.

Date: I get how you feel, I really do. But what if you're wrong? What if Majima really is behind all this?

Kiryu: If that's the case… Then I'll have no choice but to kill him.

Date: Kiryu…

Kiryu: I'm gonna go talk to him.

Date: Hold on, Kiryu! We don't know whose side he's on!

Kiryu: That's exactly why I need to go. I have a lot of questions, and Majima-san's going to answer them.

Date: Kiryu…

Kiryu: Is he still over in Purgatory?

Date: Yup, family headquarters hasn't moved an inch. Still looks like nothing more than an empty lot, though. Oh, and the way in's the same, too. Through the bathroom in the park, just like always.

Kiryu: Got it.

Date: And Kiryu? Promise me you won't let your guard down.

Kiryu: I promise.

Go To West Park
[Kiryu walks to the park where Purgatory, a real city for the homeless, is located. He opens the door to the public bathroom and sees… instead of a park, it's now a construction site. There is practically nothing on the huge concreted square except a small building with a sign 真島組 (Majima Family). Kiryu has no choice but to go inside. Inside is a chair and table with a telephone and a handwritten note - 御用のちは "007"まで (Dial "007" for assistance) (alt. translation “If you need me, call 007.”). Kiryu dials the number and hears only Majima's hysterical laughter. Frustrated, he hangs up, but when Kiryu leaves the building… he is orcutted by a hundred or two yakuza. They bow to him. A smiling Majima himself appears.]

Kiryu: Majima-san.

Majima: Why the stern face, Kiryu-chan? I didn't spook ya, did I?

Kiryu: What is all this?

Majima: Oh, just my chaperones. World's so upside-down, it ain't even safe keeping your office above ground anymore. But the Majima Family's arms are wide open.

[Majima's men move out of the way, making a passage for the boss.]

[Kiryu and Majima descend into a subway station that serves as a kind of hangout for criminals of all stripes. It used to be run by the Florist of Sai. Now it belongs to the Majima Family.]

Majima: So. How 'bout we take this somewhere a little more private? Got just the place in mind. Don't go falling behind, Kiryu-chan. 

[Kiryu follows Majima.]

Majima: Last stop, Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: The Coliseum.

Majima: Only things fightin' in there now are the dust bunnies. It's nice and quiet, you got my word. Shall we?

Kiryu: …Okay.

[They enter the grim and long abandoned fighting ring.]

Majima: The memories are floodin' back, huh? Only been two years since I was takin' to the ring myself. Got fond memories tradin' blows with ya here, Kiryu-chan. Too bad it's a damn ghost town now.

Kiryu: The Coliseum's closed?

Majima: Been so for 'bout a year now. Somethin' else came up, pulled my attention away.

Kiryu: Something like the Okinawa resort deal?

Majima: (mad smile) Guess the viper's outta the bag, huh?

Kiryu: Majima-san. Why did you do it? Why get involved?

Majima: I was keepin' my eye out for Daigo. Just like we promised.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Majima: I was just… tryin' to make shit easier for him. Y'know how intense all that politics bull can get.

Kiryu: But Daigo didn't want any part of the resort deal. That's what got him shot, Right?

Majima: Been wonderin' about that myself.

Kiryu: Majima-san. 

Majima: …Kiryu-chan.

Kiryu: I don't think you could've come up with this whole resort scheme on your own. You have to be working with someone.

Majima: ……

Kiryu: The question is, who is it?

Majima: ……

Kiryu: Why aren't you saying anything?

Majima: ……

Kiryu: Majima-san. Tell me the truth, now.

Majima: Kiryu-chan. Doubt ya believe it, but I take the yakuza code real serious. Even if someone's up and framed me, I'm not gonna go spillin' the beans for free.

[He snaps his fingers… and the huge spotlights on the ceiling come on. The hall is filled with people and they cheerfully greet the, um, fighters. Kiryu and Majima find themselves in the center of the ring. A huge cage descends on them, preventing them from leaving the ring. Majima rips his tie off.]

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen! At long last, the legendary duo returns!

Kiryu: So this is how it is.

Majima: If you want me spillin' my guts… …you're gonna have to beat 'em out of me!

[He pulls off his jacket and shirt in one swoop, exposing his demon tattoo.]

Kiryu: (laughs) No surprise there. That's how it always goes with us.

[He, too, pulls off his jacket and shirt, exposing his dragon tattoo.]

Announcer: First is the king of the Ring, the Dragon of Dojima… Kazuma Kiryu! Versus! The One-Eyed Demon, the Mad Dog of Shimano, and the Patron Saint of Pain… Goro Majima! For the first time in two years, these titans are back in action! Who will emerge victorious!?

Majima: That's my Kiryu-chan! Wouldn't have it any other way. 

Kiryu: (smirks)

Majima: Ya ask me, there's nothin' better than us two rumbling!

Kiryu: Yeah… I guess not.

Majima: (unsheathes his tanto) So, no holds barred. Hit me with all ya got Kiryu-chan!

Announcer: Now, the gong!

[Kiryu defeats Majima in a tense epic battle!]

Announcer: The winner is… Kazuma Kiryu!

Majima: Ya walloped me good, Kiryu-chan. 

[He hums and holds out his hand to help his friend up.]

Majima: Well, a promise is a promise. Come back to my office and we'll chat.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Chapter 8: CONSPIRATORS
[Kiryu arrives at Majima's real office, located in a palace at the far end of this underground city of sins. It used to be the Florist's office.]

Majima: So you wanna know who gave me the hookup with that guy Suzuki, huh? He's some kinda minister or some shit, right? Well… it was Hamazaki.

Kiryu: What?

Majima: Yup. He's been tryin' to poke his grubby little fingers into that Okinawa deal ever since he learned the Tojo were helping scrounge up the land for it. But Daigo walked, right? What was poor o' Hamazaki gonna do? Take matters into his own hands, that's what. Pick up where Daigo left off, snatch up rights to the resort. So he phoned up Suzuki, boasted about havin' bigger balls than the Tojo, and that was that. Game-set, Hamazaki.

Kiryu: And that's when he offered you the construction contract?

Majima: Yup. Didn't make sense why he'd come to me with such a juicy offer… But it's all crystal fuckin' clear now.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Majima: Kiryu-chan. Ya saw that photo of me and Suzuki chummin' around, right? I got a damn good idea of who let it slip. Hamazaki.

Kiryu: But why?

Majima: It proves someone was dealin' with Suzuki on behalf of the Tojo… and that this “someone” was me. That kinda shit hits the news, me and Suzuki would be in the slammer quicker than you can say false imprisonment. All Hamazakï'd have to do then is swoop in and clean up the scraps. He'd make a damn killin'. Enough to stop him blowing up any more Chinese joints, that's for sure.

Kiryu: Sounds like he's more vulture than man.

Majima: Yup. That resort shit's not the only thing he's gunnin' for, either.

Kiryu: There's more?

Majima: Ohhh yes. Last time I was with him, he looked me square in the eye… Said he wanted Kamurocho all to himself. Only one way to interpret that.

Kiryu: Which is what?

Majima: Think about it, Kiryu-chan. Daigo and Kashiwagi get filled with lead, you beat the snot outta Kanda… The whole city's fair game, and Hamazaki's ready to pounce.

Kiryu: But how could he have known all that would happen?

Majima: Ya ask me, he planned it from the start, Everything fallin' into place so perfectly is just a teeensy bit too convenient, don't ya think?

Kiryu: I guess. And his ultimate goal is taking over Kamurocho?

Majima: Not just that. There's one more head in his crosshairs.

Kiryu: …The Tojo Clan.

Familiar Voice: There's more to it than that.

[Majima's table, along with part of the floor, descends impressively, as we have already seen in other games in the series. Down at the Florist’s mancave there is a whole complex to keep an eye on the residents of Kamurocho.]

The Florist: Been a while, Kiryu.

Kiryu: Florist. I haven't seen you in what, two years?

The Florist: Somewhere around that, yeah.

Kiryu: I didn't think I'd find you down here again. Pretty steep fall from that loft up in the Millennium Tower.

The Florist: Heh, you're telling me. Anyway, Majima-san here's letting me borrow the place. Lost the rights to my prior place after all the stuff that went down two years ago.

Kiryu: Guess that makes sense.

The Florist: Now, about Hamazaki.

Kiryu: Right. You said there's more to it?

The Florist: You bet there is. Seems he's fixing to pawn off the whole resort to the Chinese once it's built.

Kiryu: What?

The Florist: Take a gander at this. (shows a photo of Hamazaki and a Chinese man on the screen)

Kiryu: That's…

The Florist: Yup. Lau Ka Long, leader of the Snake Flower Triad, the Chinese syndicate you brought crashing down 4 years ago.

Kiryu: What does he have to do with all this?

The Florist: Well, after he survived his first run-in with you, he skulked back to China, waiting for an opportunity to strike back. That's when he found the Hamazaki Family, a far-distant branch of the Tojo that so far hadn't done much more than ruffle a few feathers in a Yokohama suburb. But with the Snake Flower Triad's backing, Hamazaki laid claim to every last speck of the city, a feat that saw him shoot up through the Tojo Clan ranks. Next is this. (shows another picture - Hamazaki and Lau Ka Long sign some papers)

Kiryu: …What am I looking at?

The Florist: The key here is the jumble of papers on the table. This is more than any old pile of scrap, though. It's a contract between Hamazaki and Lau Ka Long… tying the Snake Flower Triad into the resort deal.

Kiryu: A contract? For what, exactly?

The Florist: From what I can tell, Hamazaki's planning to build some top secret mega-casino under the resort. That contract makes it so the Snake Flower Triad are the ones running it. Probably to pay them back for helping him conquer Yokohama.

Kiryu: Hamazaki must be working pretty closely with Suzuki if he's serious about pulling this off.

The Florist: Agreed. Gotta say, a small-time yakuza operation making a meteoric rise like this is pretty damn unheard of. 

Majima: Didn't realize Hamazaki was balls deep in this shit…

Kiryu: One question, Florist. Why do you know all this?

The Florist: Astute observation. The truth of it is, I was hired to dig up dirt on Hamazaki about six months ago.

Kiryu: Hired? By who?

The Florist: (pauses) Daigo Dojima.

Majima: What!? Ya didn't tell me Daigo was linin' your pockets!

Kiryu: Explain yourself, Florist.

The Florist: …All right. Normally I'm not too keen on divulging my clients' identities, but I think Daigo'd forgive me given the circumstances.

Kiryu: When did he first approach you?

The Florist: A year or so back. Said he was hot on the heels of a traitor in the Tojo Clan.

Kiryu: Hamazaki, huh?

The Florist: I'm getting there. Anyway, Daigo came to me worried that someone was conspiring to commandeer the resort deal behind his back. Someone in the Tojo Clan. So I worked with Daigo, sent some of my boys into the family offices, and pinched as much info as I could.

Kiryu: Which is how you got your hands on that photo.

The Florist: Yup.

Majima: And what ya found out was, Hamazaki was schemin' to shoot Daigo and Kashiwagi! Right?

The Florist: Probably.

Majima: Whaddya mean, “probably”!? If I wanted ambiguous bullshit, I woulda gone to a fortune teller!

The Florist: Listen. I only started looking into all this again after Daigo got shot… But that's when a new actor showed up on the stage. (pushes a few buttons)

Majima: What in the…?

[They see Kazama’s photo on the screen.]

The Florist: Real shocker, huh? For you, at least. It's like his ghost's come back to haunt you. Fishy stuff… Too fishy.

[Kiryu pulls up the bloodstained drawing.]

Kiryu: Just… who is he?

The Florist: What's that you got there? Why do you have a sketch of him?

The Florist’s Man: Boss! Something's going down in Kamurocho!

The Florist: What?

[They see a huge Chinese gang on the streets of Kamurocho. Most of them are armed with swords and sticks.]

Kiryu: Lau Ka Long…

[The inhabitants of Kamurocho are terrified of the armed thugs. Lau Ka Long pulls out a picture of Rikiya and smirks nastily.]

Lau Ka Long: 喂 [You.]

Snake Flower’s Thug: 有什么事呀? [What is it, sir?]

Lau Ka Long: 把这个男的给我找回来 [I need you to find this man.]

Snake Flower’s Thug: 是! [Understood, sir!]

The Florist: Kiryu, that's…

Kiryu: Rikiya!

The Florist: Dunno why, but it looks like Lau's using his Snake Flower cronies to hunt down your pal.

[Kiryu quickly decides to call Rikiya.]

Rikiya: Hello?

Kiryu: Rikiya! It's Kiryu!

Rikiya: Oh, Aniki. What's hanging?

Kiryu: Where are you right now?

Rikiya: Huh? Well uh, you were gone when I woke up, so I'm out takin' in the sights on my own. …Hm? The hell was that?

Kiryu: What? Rikiya! What's going on over there?

Rikiya: Think you're tough, huh? Hm? Argh!

Kiryu: Rikiya? Hey, Rikiya!

[But there’s no answer.]

Kiryu: (I've gotta help him!)

Save Rikiya!
[Kiryu runs like hell, but Nishida stops him!]

Nishida: Wait up, Kiryu-san! I saw you in there flinging those fists of yours at the boss! Pretty dang impressive, I've gotta say!

Kiryu: Sorry, Nishida. I'm kinda in a hurry here.

Nishida: Oh, right… Guess I'll let you go then. Hey, but before you do! We're dusting off the ol' Coliseum and opening it back up for full-time business! Haven't seen the boss this pumped since that time he gave me acupuncture! Anyway, we've got a lot of beefy fighters lined up, so drop by and take a few swings when you get the chance!

Kiryu: Thanks, Nishida. I will.

[He runs to the exit of the Purgatory.]

Kiryu: (Those Snake Flower thugs are probably all over the place by now. Should I head out?)

Not Yet
Go Save Rikiya ✓

Kiryu: (I'll be there soon, Rikiya!)

Find Rikiya!
[Kiryu runs through the city crashing Snake Flower Gang!]

Kiryu: Where are Lau and Rikiya!?

Snake Flower Thug: I… I don't know…

Kiryu: Do I have to beat it out of you?

Snake Flower Thug: Please, I tell the truth! Only officer know where boss is!

Kiryu: And where can I find this officer?

Snake Flower Thug: Not far ahead. He stand out because of clothes.

Kiryu: Dammit… All right. I better not see you around here again. (Looks like I need to track down this officer.)

[He fights his way through.]

Kiryu: You must be the Snake Flower officer. Tell me where your boss is.

Snake Flower Officer: Sorry, that not happen. Instead, you die!

[Kiryu defeats the officer, but he escapes. Kiryu fights his way through, catches up with the officer and beats him half to death.]

Snake Flower Officer: You… strong as ox…

Kiryu: Tell me where Lau is, before I show you how strong I really am.

Snake Flower Officer: Boss… He… Well, he… (runs away) Eep!

Kiryu: It just never ends with this guy… Get back here!

Catch the Snake Flower Officer!
[Kiryu runs after the officer and quickly catches him before he escapes into the narrow alleys!]

Snake Flower Officer: Phew…

Kiryu: Finally done running, huh? Guess it's time to make you tell me the truth.

Snake Flower Officer: Eep, wait! Wait! I tell you everything! Boss is on roof of building on Nakamichi Alley. Your friend there with him!

Kiryu: (Dammit… I need to get over there!)

[Kiryu again has to run through crowds of thugs. Once he finds the right building, he sees that it is guarded by a red-clad Chinaman.]

Kiryu: (Looks like this is the place.) Step aside. Lau and I have a score to settle.

Snake Flower Officer: (bangs his fist against his hand) ……

Kiryu: Fine. Guess we'll have to do this the hard way.

[He defeats the officer with a skillful bicycle smash to the head.]

Kiryu: (I'm coming, Rikiya!)

[He runs out onto the roof. The Snake Flower Gang is holding Rikiya hostage. Standing next to them is Lau himself.]

Kiryu: Rikiya!

Rikiya: Aniki!

Lau Ka Long: Oh how I've missed you, Kazuma Kiryu. 

Kiryu: Lau!

Lau Ka Long: We're overdue for a little talk. So I thought I'd lure you out.

Kiryu: I know what you're after. He has nothing to do with this! Let him go!

Lau Ka Long: You fail to understand. 

[He leaps deftly from the top of the roof to the bottom, where Kiryu is standing.]

Lau Ka Long: My alliance with Hamazaki was forged for nothing more than revenge. On you. (stands up in a fighting stance)

Kiryu: And that's why you got Rikiya involved.

[One of Lau’s men throws him an elaborately decorated chinese glaive. As Lau grabs it, he demonstrates his mastery of the glaive.]

Lau Ka Long: Now, let us put an end to this at last… Kazuma Kiryu!

[An epic and humorous battle takes place. Kiryu has to put a lot of effort into dodging the glaive and counter-strikes. There are boxes scattered all over the roof… Kiryu puts one on Lau's head and hits him with blow after blow! After a few minutes of intense fighting, Kiryu wins. Lau falls to the concrete floor. Kiryu climbs the fence for Rikiya, but suddenly Lau grabs his leg.]

Lau Ka Long: We're not finished just yet.

[Snake Flower Thug prepares to chop Rikiya’s head off with a ridiculously huge Chinese sword.]

Kiryu: Rikiya!

Rikiya: Aniki!

Lau Ka Long: Now, watch close… As your friend's head is severed from his shoulders!

Kiryu: Rikiya!

[Suddenly the thug with a huge sword dies from several shots from a pistol. The second one follows him. Kiryu notices Kazama on a nearby rooftop.]

Lau Ka Long: What? But you're… supposed to be dead!

[Kazama kills Lau with a shot to the head.]

Kiryu: Kazama-san! Answer me. Are you Shintaro Kazama or not!? That's not all. I need to know… Why did you shoot Daigo and Nakahara!?

Kazama: So you're Kazuma Kiryu.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Kazama: (in ENGLISH) Beautiful eyes… Like I heard from my brother before.

[Kazama leaves. Kiryu is left standing on the roof in bewilderment… for he knows no English.]

Chapter 9: THE PLOT
[Kiryu returns to Majima's office to discuss what happened with him, the Florist, and Date.]

Majima: That Kazama-lookin' guy really said all that?

Kiryu: Yeah.

The Florist: Hm… Can't help but wonder what he wants. All we know for sure is that he's wrapped up in this whole mess somehow.

Kiryu: (to Rikiya) What's wrong? You still hurt?

Rikiya: Not really. Aniki, I just… don't know what to think of all this. Why'd that guy with the mustache save my life? 'Specially after he shot the boss. …Why help me?

Kiryu: Rikiya. I need you to head back to Okinawa. I have some loose ends to tie up here. But you? There's nothing keeping you in this city.

Rikiya: But!

Kiryu: Just hear me out, okay? Right now, we don't know whether the man in the sketch is a friend or foe. Go home, be safe. Take care of Saki for me. Watch after Morning Glory. Can you do that?

Rikiya: Yeah.

[On the table, the phone rings. The florist picks up the phone.]

The Florist: What's up? What? The chairman of the Hakuho? Hey, Kiryu. You know Mine, from the Hakuho Clan? Sounds like he swung over here to see you.

[After a while, Mine arrives at Majima's office with a huge suitcase.]

Mine: A gaudy place like this has been underneath Kamurocho all this time? Who would have thought?

Kiryu: Well? You want to talk to me?

Mine: Yes, you must forgive me. I'm afraid my organization is in part to blame for all the trouble you've been facing. I'm here to hold myself accountable.

Kiryu: Accountable…?

Mine: Yes.

[He puts the huge suitcase on the table, snaps the latches open, and turns it around to face Date, the Florist, Rikia, and Majima standing at the table. He slowly opens it…]

Majima: Kanda!?

[Rikia begins to feel nauseous.]

Kiryu: Mine… What is the meaning of this?

LAST NIGHT,
AT HAKUHO HQ…

[A recently battered Kanda sits on the couch in bandages and band-aids.]

Kanda: Kiryu, you dirty son of a bitch! You're not gettin' away with this!

[He breaks an expensive glass vase with a kick.]

Kanda: The hell's the stoneface for? Huh, Mine!? Don't just sit there twiddlin' your thumbs! Say something, jackoff!

Mine: Aniki. This is my office. I suggest you be a little more respectful.

Kanda: You can shove your respect! If you weren't so damn chill about everythin' I'd never have got my ass whooped by Kiryu!

Mine: I told you in the officers meeting. I don't consider Kiryu-san my enemy. This wouldn't have happened had you not gone looking for a fight… Now I'm gettin' lectured by some limp-dicked coward, huh? Well I don't wanna hear it! 

[He breaks a beautiful and very expensive mural by ripping it off the wall. Then a vase. Then a mahogany cabinet.]

Kanda: Ya hear, Mine!? Gimme your cash and your boys! Kiryu ain't survivin' the night! And then I'm gonna be seventh chairman! I'll even let ya be my captain!

Mine: (smirks) You truly are a fool, aren't you?

Kanda: The shit? I dare ya to say that again!

Mine: The collection you just demolished… was worth over one billion yen.

Kanda: Like I give a rat's ass! You wipe your shitstains with that kinda cash!

Mine: Money isn't the issue here. You just can't seem to perceive worth. Neither theirs nor yours.

Kanda: What was that!? Perceive this, you little shit!

[He tries to punch Mine, but he is much quicker to punch him in the stomach.]

Mine: I realize I failed to mention this before. But the truth is, I'm much stronger than I look.

[He hits Kanda hard several times that blood splashes on the floor, then wipes his fist with a towel.]

Kanda: Mine…

Mine: You're useless to me now. Except perhaps as my apology to Kiryu-san.

[A couple of Mine’s men enter the office.]

Mine: Don't do it here. He's made a big enough mess as is.

Mine’s Thugs: Yes, sir.

Kanda: Hey, hold on a sec… Mine! Wait, Mine! Mine!

[But Mine left the office. Back to underground sin city.]

Mine: I suppose it was my fault for allowing Kanda to rise so far above his station. You have my deepest apologies. Can we consider this Nishikiyama Family incident resolved? I plan to assemble the Tojo Clan families without delay and attempt to restore order. As for Hamazaki, my Hakuho men are searching for him. Though… I suspect he won't turn up.

Kiryu: Do you have some idea where he might have gone?

Mine: I do. I imagine he's no longer in the country.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Mine: The head of the Japanese Snake Flower branch, Lau Ka Long, is dead. Snake Flower headquarters would never accept such failure. And given Hamazaki was Lau's partner, they've surely kidnapped him in retaliation. The rest of his family was apparently found floating in the Yokohama Bay.

Kiryu: That's the Snake Flower, all right.

Mine: In any case, without us even having to lift a finger… the Hamazaki Family is gone. I plan to reach out to Snake Flower headquarters to hopefully prevent any further bloodshed.

Kiryu: That so?

Mine: Kiryu-san… The Tojo Clan is on a knife's edge. We need you now more than ever. I suggest you take care of yourself. (bows)  Farewell.

Kiryu: Mine. Who told you to handle things like this?

Mine: I'm not sure I follow.

Kiryu: Then let me restate. Would Daigo have done the same thing in your shoes?

Mine: I doubt it.

Kiryu: Then why are you…

Mine: Well, Daigo is no longer the one giving orders. This decision was mine, and mine alone. By the way, Kiryu-san. Some of the blame for all of this… rests on your very shoulders. Daigo-san told me everything. About your orphanage in Okinawa. You're a coward. No regard for the position you hold. You may think you're turning over a new leaf. But it's all meaningless. Mere hypocrisy.

Kiryu: What!?

Mine: I intend on moving forward in the way I see most fit. Methods aside… I do see myself as the successor to Daigo-san's legacy.

Kiryu: Mine, you…

Mine: In other words, every last thing I do is done with the aim of aiding the Tojo Clan. A motive I'm sure Daigo-san would approve of. Anyone that stands in my way will be eliminated. Even if that person… is one of our own. I’ll never understand it. What could Daigo-san see in a man like you?

Kiryu: Mine. You've lost your way.

Mine: Excuse me?

Kiryu: And someday… I'll prove it to you.

Mine: I don't expect you will. I have nothing to learn from you.

[He leaves the office with the suitcase.]

Majima: Didn't think Mine was the kinda guy to slaughter one of his own like that. Pretty fuckin' brutal. Wouldn't ya say, Kiryu-chan?

Kiryu: ……

Majima: Least Kanda's outta our hair. And Hamazaki's probably fish bait by now. Meanin' it's all over. Everyone who was tryin' to rub you and Daigo outta the picture is finished.

Date: Well, not exactly. Hamazaki was a traitor, there's no question about that. And thanks to the Snake Flower, he and his family are no more. But that doesn't mean this is the end. There's still that man who looks like Kazama. I doubt he would have put a bullet in Daigo just for the hell of it… meaning someone's probably giving him orders.

Kiryu: That's the only explanation for him shooting Nakahara and stealing the land deed, too. He can't be working alone.

Date: Hamazaki's the most obvious suspect, since he was after control of both the resort and the Tojo Clan.

The Florist: But if this Kazama guy was working for Hamazaki, why would he go outta his way to save Kiryu and Rikiya? There are still a ton of question marks here.

Date: Kiryu. rm gonna try to find out what happened to Hamazaki. Florist, do me a favor and look into Mine and the Hakuho Clan while I'm gone.

Kiryu: Mine?

Date: At this point, Tojo leadership's been practically decimated. Majima and Mine are the only two left standing.

Majima: You implyin' I got a horse in this race!?

Date: Heh. If I was, I sure wouldn't have said it to your face.

The Florist: All right. I'll see what I can dig up on the Hakuho and that Kazama look-alike.

Kiryu: Speaking of Kazama-san… his family is leaderless now that Kashiwagi-san is gone. Think you can step up in his place, Majima-san? Oh, and be careful. I'm sure some of the other families will try to take advantage of the power vacuum this creates.

Majima: I, er… Sure. Ya got it, Kiryu-chan.

Date: Kiryu. Let me know the second you learn anything.

Kiryu: I will.

Date: Well, all that's left to do now is put this plan into action. We'll be in touch.

Majima: Heh. Guess I got a date with the Kazama Family.

[Majima and Date leave the office.]

Kiryu: (First things first, I've gotta make sure Rikiya gets back to Okinawa, The least I can do is see him to a taxi.) All right, Rikiya. It's time for you to go back.

Rikiya: …Yeah.

Kiryu: Come on, I'll take you over to a taxi. If we leave now, we should be able to get you on the next flight down.

Rikiya: It's okay, Aniki. I can go on my own.

Kiryu: Barely any time has passed since the Snake Flower Triad tried to murder you, Rikiya. You shouldn't be out by yourself. Not yet.

Rikiya: …Yeah, I guess you're right. Let's go.

[At the taxi stop…]

Kiryu: (Guess this is goodbye for now…)

Don't Show Rikiya Off Yet
Show Rikiya Off ✓

Kiryu: Rikiya. This taxi will take you to the airport. Make sure you get on your flight, okay?

Rikiya: Aniki, I…

Kiryu: I'll be fine. Just make sure Nakahara and the kids are safe. After all, we still don't know who we're up against. It sounds like this whole thing is out of the Tojo Clan's hands, at the very least. And with Nakahara still in the hospital, you're the only one those kids can rely on. Same goes for the Ryudo Family. They're all counting on you, Rikiya.

Rikiya: …Right. I won't let them down. Anyway, guess it's time for me to go. Try keepin' yourself outta harm's way… Okay, Aniki?

Kiryu: Yeah. I'll be home soon.

[As Rikiya leaves, Kiryu gets a strange call…]

Man's Voice: Is this Kazuma Kiryu?

Kiryu: It is. Who's asking?

Tamiya: This is the Minister of Defense. Tamiya.

Kiryu: Tamiya!?

Tamiya: As you're aware, I had been in contact with Daigo Dojima regarding the proposed Okinawa deal.

Kiryu: Yeah. Your secretary Toma told me all about it a year or so ago.

Tamiya: Right. Unfortunately, after Daigo Dojima was shot… The Suzuki-supporting members of the Tojo Clan flung into overdrive attempting to push the resort. In turn, I had no choice but to ensure my military expansion bill passed as well.

Kiryu: What do you mean? I thought the resort started back up because you tried to pass your bill, not the other way around.

Tamiya: Not exactly. My attempts to see the military expansion bill passed were the result of a third party. My hand was forced.

Kiryu: And what does any of this have to do with me?

Tamiya: I need you to do me a favor.

Kiryu: Keep the resort from starting up again?

Tamiya: Not quite. Though the end result will ultimately lead to that.

Kiryu: I'm not sure I follow. Aren't your base and that resort some kind of linked pair? If the resort doesn't happen, neither will your base.

Tamiya: This matter is regrettably not as simple as that. Regardless, if you still want to put a stop to this resort deal, come to my office in the Diet Building.

Kiryu: The Diet Building, huh?

Tamiya: You heard me. I'll have my driver wait for you in front of the Millennium Tower. He'll bring you to me.

Kiryu: Fine. I have a few questions of my own that could use answering. (What could Tamiya want with me? And who's that third party he mentioned? I knew there was more to this than just some internal Tojo Clan feud. I should let Date-san know what's going on.)

[He calls Date.]

Date: What's the scoop, Kiryu?

Kiryu: Date-san. I just got off the phone with Tamiya, the Minister of Defense.

Date: What? Why would he want to talk to you?

Kiryu: I wish I knew. Either way, it looks like someone from the Tojo Clan is still pulling the strings in all this. Tamiya also mentioned some kind of third party being involved. He asked me to come to the Diet Building to talk to him in person. I'm about to head over.

Date: To the Diet Building? How are you gonna get there?

Kiryu: He's sending a driver over. Apparently we're meeting in front of the Millennium Tower.

Date: Wait, Kiryu. Take me with you.

Kiryu: …Are you sure?

Date: Of course I'm sure! So, wanna meet up outside the Millennium Tower?

Kiryu: And risk making Tamiya's driver suspicious? Probably not a good idea. Let's head over there together, okay? Where are you now?

Date: At Serena, as always. I'll see you out front.

[Kiryu runs to New Serena and finds Date outside.]

Date: Kiryu! What took you so long?

Kiryu: Sorry, Date-san. I got here as fast as I could.

Date: Don't worry about it. Gotta say, though. Tamiya ringing you up is a pretty unexpected development.

Kiryu: Yeah… Hopefully meeting him will clear some things up. 

Date: Hope so. And don't forget that Tamiya's one of the biggest political figureheads in the country. Who knows what he could be planning. In other words, we should be ready for anything. You about good to go?

Not quite yet.
Yeah, let's do it. ✓

Kiryu: Yeah, let's do it.

Date: Great. Time to swing by the Millennium Tower then.

[They go to the Millennium Tower and find the driver here.]

Tamiya's Secretary: Ah. You must be Kazuma Kiryu-sama.

Kiryu: Yeah. And you're Tamiya's driver, right?

Tamiya's Secretary: Actually, his secretary. You can call me Higaki, sir. And you. You're from… the media, yes?

Date: Yup. Name's Date, from the Keihin News. Used to hang my hat with the force though. That's how I know Kiryu.

Higaki: I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid I can't allow a reporter to—

Date: Now hold your horses. What we have here is a prominent government official arranging a private meeting with the ex-chairman of a major crime syndicate. If you don't let me come, I'll have to write an article based on that info alone. And who knows what kind of conclusions I could draw from that.

Higaki: But…

Kiryu: Sorry, but I think it's for the best if you let Date-san come with us. We promise he won't write about anything he hears today. Right, Date-san?

Date: Yeah, sure.

Higaki: …Very well, then. Please get in the car when you're ready, sir.

Don't Get In
Get In ✓

Kiryu: All right, let's go.

Higaki: Very well, sir. Just get in the car and we'll be on our way.

[The car brings Date and Kiryu to a huge government building. They enter the office of Tamiya, who, in the tradition of filmmaking, sits in a chair with his back to them. He turns around with a cigar in his hand.]

Tamiya: You're younger than I expected. And that is?

Date: Name's Date, with the Keihin News. I'm researching Suzuki's link with the Tojo Clan.

Tamiya: Ah, the famous detective turned reporter. Can I offer you gentlemen a drink?

Kiryu: No thanks.

Tamiya: I hear you're running an orphanage on a piece of land earmarked for the resort.

Kiryu: That's right.

Tamiya: Rumor has it, that's why Daigo Dojima backed out of the deal.

Kiryu: What's your point?

Tamiya: My point is… our objectives in all of this are aligned.

Kiryu: Meaning what?

[Tamiya offers his guest to sit down on the couch.]

Tamiya: You want to put an end to the resort, yes?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Tamiya: I, too, find that the most preferable outcome.

Date: Wait, what? What are you talking about!?

Kiryu: Without the resort, won't your military expansion bill be doomed to fail?

Tamiya: It will, yes. However. That doesn't matter now.

Date: It doesn't matter? Why not?

Tamiya: It's simple. I had no intention of passing that bill in the first place.

Date: What!?

Kiryu: Explain yourself, Tamiya Your military expansion bill, the resort deal… We want to know everything.

Tamiya: As long as you don't forget the favor I mentioned earlier. What would you like to know?

Kiryu: (What should I ask about?)

The purpose of the military expansion bill.
The man who shot Daigo.
The favor Tamiya mentioned. ✓

Kiryu: You mentioned a favor. What do you need?

Tamiya: I need you to save the lives of two men.

Kiryu: Who are they?

Tamiya: The first is my former secretary, Toma.

Date: Former? What happened?

Tamiya: Two weeks back, he tendered his resignation. 

Kiryu: Why?

Tamiya: He learned the truth about why I was advocating the military expansion bill. And so, he abandoned me for the man now in control of the resort development.

Kiryu: Which is who?

Tamiya: A yakuza.

Date: What!?

Tamiya: The head of the Tojo Clan's Hakuho Clan. Yoshitaka Mine.

Kiryu: Mine?

Date: Hold the damn phone! 

Tamiya: There's a high probability Toma will attempt to divulge our secrets to Mine. Guaranteeing that someone will in turn try to silence him.

Kiryu: "Someone"? Is this the other man you want me to save?

Tamiya: That's correct. I need you to make sure he doesn't kill Toma.

Kiryu: And who is he, exactly?

Tamiya: Joji Kazama. Do you have any further questions?

Kiryu: (Apparently Toma joined up with Mine once he learned what Tamiya was really after. And now, Joji Kazama is trying to silence Toma before he can spill any of Tamiya's secrets. So it looks like I'll need to stop Joji. But why did Toma join Mine in the first place? And what does Mine have to do with the resort? I need to know more. What should I ask about?)

The purpose of the military expansion bill. ✓
The man who shot Daigo.
The favor Tamiya mentioned. 
Mine.

Kiryu: What's the real purpose of your military expansion bill?

Tamiya: My goal in all this… Is bringing a highly secretive global syndicate to light. And destroying them.

Date: What, like some mafia involved in the resort?

Tamiya: If only it were that simple. The organization I'm attempting to expose is known only as Black Monday.

Kiryu: Black Monday?

Date: Wait. You mean the black market arms dealers?

Tamiya: I see you're a reporter worth your salt. That's right. The year was 1987. With the crash of the New York stock exchange, the world was thrust into economic depression. A man named Andre Richardson and his followers were thought to have orchestrated the whole thing. Both the day and his group were given the name Black Monday. I concocted this Okinawa military scheme as a means of smoking them out.

Date: Smoking them out? What do you mean?

Tamiya: As you know, this base has been touted as the linchpin of the revolutionary BMD system. Trillions have been spent on its development. Imagine how much the plans alone would be worth.

Date: It's no chump change, that's for sure.

Tamiya: With the combined effort of our superior technology and America's advanced weaponry… This new BMD system, once installed at the Okinawa base… Would make us nigh untouchable by hostile nations. Japan would be the safest country known to man. Any possible threat from the rest of Asia would be essentially nonexistent for decades to come.

Kiryu: They're putting something like that in Okinawa?

Tamiya: This BMD system could bring about a massive shift in the global balance of power. At least, that's what everyone has been led to believe.

Date: Led to believe?

Tamiya: That's correct. It was absolutely vital that we propagated those rumors.

Kiryu: What are you getting at?

Tamiya: Consider this highly advanced weapons technology. Who might be interested in making off with it?

Date: Hold on. You're not talking about… Black Monday!?

Tamiya: Indeed I am. With clientele based all over the world, they're always on the lookout for new wares. And with these rumors circulating around the international market… Well, the end result isn't too difficult to imagine. This isn't an opportunity they can pass up.

Date: So all this BMD stuff was just bait to draw Black Monday out into the light?

Kiryu: Same goes for the military expansion bill. It was just a fake to trick them into resurfacing.

Tamiya: Fake or not, I had to act as though I was insistent on passing it. That's why I suggested the resort to Suzuki. By pairing our two proposals… I could keep both my bill and my scheme alive. In other words, this tactic led me to deceive every last citizen in our country. It was the only possible way.

Kiryu: But… you said you don't care about the bill passing anymore. Does that mean…?

Tamiya: Yes. After all this time, I've finally ensnared Black Monday.

Date: Then you never planned on running against Suzuki to be prime minister, either?

Tamiya: Such a thing is for the young and vain. I have no interest in the position.

Date: But if even America's wrapped up in this… it's too big for you to have planned alone.

Tamiya: Right you are. I'd like to speak further to that point as well. Do you have any further questions?

Kiryu: (So Tamiya came up with the military expansion bill to lure out an international arms smuggling syndicate known as Black Monday. Their leader, Andre Richardson, would no doubt be drawn in by the BMD system they're proposing for Okinawa. In other words, the only reason Tamiya was so insistent on the military expansion was so he could stamp out Black Monday once and for all. He has to be working with someone, though. Someone with connections to the U.S. Army. That person holds the key to all of this. hat should I ask about?)

The purpose of the military expansion bill. 
The man who shot Daigo. ✓
The favor Tamiya mentioned. 
Mine.

Kiryu: Do you know the man who shot Daigo?

Tamiya: Unfortunately, I can't say I do.

Kiryu: I should've known.

Date: You mean that Kazama look-alike, right? Damn. Wish we knew what he wants.

Tamiya: Wait, did you say Kazama? Is he the one who pulled the trigger?

Kiryu: Do you know him?

Tamiya: Mhm. If the Kazama I know and the one you're talking about are the same man, that is.

Kiryu: Then tell me. This Kazama you know… Just who is he?

Tamiya: Joji Kazama. Younger brother of Shintaro Kazama, former patriarch of the Kazama Family you once belonged to.

Kiryu: Kazama-san had… a brother?

Tamiya: You weren't aware?

Kiryu: No.

Tamiya: I see. I suppose it's not a surprise he never mentioned that fact.

Date: It's not?

Tamiya: No. You see, after Shintaro lost both his parents at a very young age… His brother Joji was his only surviving relative. Such a bond is nigh unbreakable.

Date: If he and Joji were really that tight-knit, you'd think he would've mentioned the guy to Kiryu.

Tamiya: How close they were doesn't matter. There's simply no chance they could have lived as normal brothers. None at all.

Kiryu: And why's that?

Tamiya: They were walking two conflicting paths in life.

Date: So wait You're saying Kazama's brother was…

Tamiya: А сор. He used to work in what is now currently known as the Foreign Affairs Division.

Date: Whoa. Only the most elite officers get in there!

Tamiya: Elite, huh? I can see how you'd think so, given your history on the force. It's funny, though. Two men who wore the same badge to protect the future of our nation… One sits in this stuffy office sipping whisky all day, the other plies his trade on American shores.

Date: What? You don't mean…

Tamiya: Joji and I came up through the ranks together. He's the only friend I have in this harsh world.

Date: What? You and Kazama's brother!?

Tamiya: Everything that's happened in Okinawa to this point… Joji and I orchestrated the whole thing.

Date: What do you mean, "orchestrated"?

Tamiya: I formulated the plan, while Joji used his organization to carry it out. 

Kiryu: Then… Joji shooting Daigo. Was that part of the plan, too?

Tamiya: I can't rule out the possibility.

Date: And what organization are you talking about? Is Joji still with the force?

Tamiya: No. He left the Japanese police years ago.

Kiryu: Then what are you talking about?

Tamiya: He's working for the American CIA. To be precise, he's with the Central Intelligence Agency's Far East Intelligence division. Do you have any further questions?

Kiryu: (So Tamiya and Joji Kazama, an agent with the CIA and the younger brother of Shintaro Kazama, are working together to bring down an arms smuggling syndicate called Black Monday. But if that's the case, why did Kazama-san's brother shoot Daigo? I need to know what the CIA is really after here. What should I ask about?)

The purpose of the military expansion bill. 
The man who shot Daigo. 
The favor Tamiya mentioned. 
The CIA. ✓
Mine.

Kiryu: So Kazama-san's brother… Is working as a CIA spy. In Japan, of all places?

Tamiya: It's a necessary evil. The CIA has been tracking these smugglers for years. My work with Joji is another step in the larger plan to snuff out Black Monday.

Date: So you're saying Kazama's brother quit the force, joined the CIA, and is working for the Americans now?

Tamiya:That's right. 

Date: But then why's a guy like that going around putting slugs in people?

Kiryu: So it was him. The man who shot Daigo and Nakahara… It was Kazama-san's brother, wasn't it?

Tamiya: I can't say. It does seem likely, though.

Kiryu: Why would he do that?

Tamiya: The CIA agents on this case have been given the following orders. 1. Track any and all movements Black Monday makes in regard to the Okinawa military expansion bill. 2. Eliminate any thing or person that puts the success of this pressing mission at risk.

Date: What do you mean, eliminate?

Kiryu: Those who refused to sell their land… They were shot for the good of this "mission'?

Tamiya:Yes. Remember that Joji isn't the only CIA agent on this case, though. I believe you've already met some of the others.

Kiryu: Wait… The men in black suits?

Tamiya: Correct. The foreigners who assaulted you were all spies sent to these shores by the CIA. You were attempting to put a stop to the resort deal, after all.

Date: If that's true, then the guys who shot Kashiwagi were… 

Tamiya: CIA.

Kiryu: Why would Kazama-san's brother do that? Why…? Murdering one of his own countrymen…

Tamiya: In Joji's eyes, the CIA is the only thing that matters anymore.

Date: What do you mean?

Tamiya: You two may be too young to remember, but thirty years ago… The nation was far more conservative. A cop with a brother in the yakuza would be at constant risk of persecution. To say nothing of Joji's situation, with Shintaro a high-ranking Tojo officer. When the truth came to light, Joji could do nothing but leave his post. It was a dark time for him, until the American government reached out. Thus, in a country where skill mattered over all else, Joji started fresh. 

Kiryu: And now he'll do anything the CIA asks.

Tamiya: Do you have any further questions?

Kiryu: (So the CIA needed the military expansion bill to stay afloat so they could lure Black Monday out into the open. And it was under CIA orders that Joji shot Daigo for refusing to take my land. Guess the CIA is almost like a second family to him now, after what happened during his time on the force. That explains why he's so loyal to the U.S. government. What should I ask about?)

The purpose of the military expansion bill. 
The man who shot Daigo. 
The favor Tamiya mentioned. 
The CIA.
Mine. ✓

Kiryu: So Toma left to get the land for the resort on his own. 1.And the man he went to for help… was Mine?

Tamiya: Precisely.

Date: Not sure that makes much sense. If Kashiwagi's info was right, the ones pulling the strings on the resort were Suzuki, Joji Kazama… And an organization within the Tojo that Joji was working with.

Tamiya: The truth of the matter is complicated. Ever since the Tamashiro incident two years ago… not one parcel of land has been purchased for the resort.

Date: What!? Then why'd Kazama go as far as shooting Nakahara for his deed?

Tamiya: To keep the military expansion bill alive. If word got out that land acquisition had stalled, so too would the bill itself. And Black Monday would slip through our fingers. Hence, the most prudent option was intimidating Nakahara, essentially forcing him to give up his land.

Kiryu: And he used the Tojo to do it.

Tamiya: Yes. In order to get Daigo Dojima on their side… The CIA stole the deed to the plot Morning Glory rests upon in an attempt to force his hand. However…

Kiryu: Daigo didn't take the bait. So they shot him.

Tamiya: I believe so, yes. That's when Toma brought the issue of the halted land accrual to Mine. No doubt he promised Mine full control of the finished resort in exchange for his assistance.

Date: Full control of the resort? How would that benefit Toma?

Tamiya: You're aware that he was born and raised in Okinawa, yes?

Kiryu: Yeah. He told us as much himself last summer.

Tamiya: Three years ago, Toma stepped into the political world, hoping to enact serious change in Okinawa. And when he learned of the base and the resort, he was determined to help for the sake of his home.

Kiryu: Yeah… He did say something about wanting to see Okinawa flourish.

Tamiya: It's the only thing he's ever cared about. When the link between the resort and the yakuza was almost made public last year… Toma introduced me to the Tojo Clan's Chairman Dojima to ensure the base didn't go down with it. However, he never truly cared for my base. Keeping the resort afloat was his ultimate goal.

Date: And… I guess Toma first ran into Mine when he brought you there to talk strategy with Daigo, huh?

Tamiya: He then found out a year later that everything I was working towards was all fake. So with the resort deal fully in mind, he approached the Hakuho Clan to form a pact. Toma and Mine are working toward a common goal, albeit for different reasons.

Date: Well all right then. Never thought Mine'd betray the clan, though. He's always been like Daigo's loyal lapdog.

Tamiya: I can't say I understand the man. But with all that's happened, he's now the de facto head of the Tojo Clan. Power would be his if he just waited quietly… So why make this move now?

Kiryu: (So Kazama-san's brother and the CIA were promoting the military expansion bill to destroy Black Monday, while Toma and Mine were throwing their weight behind the resort… I think I'm finally starting to see the whole picture here.)

Kiryu: So Toma and Mine are pushing the Okinawa resort, while you and the CIA try to corner Black Monday. It's all starting to make sense now.

Tamiya: (stands up) …I need you to stop Joji.

Date: Stop him? You're asking us to interrupt a CIA mission?

Tamiya: Correct, if that's what it takes to protect Toma.

Date: …Why's the CIA so keen on getting rid of him in the first place, though?

Tamiya: He knows too much. He's aware of my ties to the CIA, and the fact that my military bill is a fake.

Date: So the CIA are gonna shut him up.

Tamiya: Indeed. But I have no desire to see Toma killed. I want to save both him and Joji.

Date: Hold on. Didn't Toma muck up your plans? Why save a guy who's standing against you?

Tamiya: A man with strong enough convictions will inevitably hold great ambition. And, someday, make that ambition reality. That's what my mentor always told me. Toma has a good heart. He'll be an extraordinary politician before long.

Date: That's your reason?

Kiryu: It's more than that, Date-san. If I had to guess, I'd say Tamiya's not the kind of guy who'd just abandon one of his men. It would go against everything he stands for. I'm right, aren't I?

[Tamiya smiles.]

Kiryu: (stands up) Okay. By stopping Toma now, I'll put an end to the resort, too. And besides. Kazama-san's brother and I have some unfinished business.

Tamiya: So you'll do it?

Kiryu: Not because you asked me to. All I want… is to protect Morning Glory.

Tamiya: Fair enough. If you keep Toma safe from Joji, I'll ensure that resort never sees the light of day. I swear it.

Kiryu: And Toma? Where is he now?

Tamiya: In Okinawa. Meeting with the Prefectural Assembly, if my sources are correct. I thought yakuza like you only existed in stories these days. (looks in the window) …It seems we have visitors.

Date: Something going on out there?

Tamiya: Suzuki's "security."

[There’s a lot of men in black suits outside the building.]

Date: What?

Tamiya: Toma must have planned this from the get-go.

Date: Well, Kiryu?

Kiryu: We don't have much choice… Do we?

Tamiya: That's right. There's only one route out.

Kiryu: And these security guys… What should I do with them?

Tamiya: They're essentially Suzuki's personal soldiers. Do whatever it takes to get through. I’ll assume the responsibility.

Kiryu: One more thing.

Tamiya: What is it?

Kiryu: You said earlier that you're not interested… But doesn't every politician dream of becoming prime minister someday?

Tamiya: Then allow me to flip the script, if you will. Can a footsoldier become chairman just by saying they want to? Those who reach the top are lifted there by their actions, whether they will it or not. Am I wrong?

Kiryu: Guess you have a point.

[Kiryu and Tamiya smile at each other.]

Date: Well all right. We gotta move.

Kiryu: Yeah.

[They exit the building.]

Date: Hot damn. That's a lot of guys.

Kiryu: Date-san. I’ll mop up here. You go sneak out the back.

Date: What?

Kiryu: You're media, remember? Just show them your business card. They should let you through no problem.

Date: But then!

Kiryu: If I don't come back… Tell Majima-san everything we just heard.

Date: Kiryu…

Kiryu: Now go!

[He fearlessly runs into the crowd of guards! Kiryu defeats one by one, but the forces are clearly unequal.]

Kiryu: Dammit… There's no end to them.

[Suddenly Majima appears on the… a pink truck. He goes into a skid, scattering the guards.]

Majima: (scared to death) Kiryu-chan! Where'd ya go!?

Kiryu: I'm right here!

Majima: Well thank the freakin' stars! Thought I squished ya flat like a bug! Now hurry up and hop in!

[The pink truck rushes out of the premises.]

Chapter 10: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
[Mine sits in his office and looks at his childhood photo. Voices from his past sound in his head…]

Mine’s Uncle: Yoshitaka! Yoshitaka!

Young Mine: Hey, dad! /translation mistake because 伯父さん (oji-san, uncle) is used. Later in the text this error will occur several more times. Interesting fact - the original translation did not have this mistake./

Mine’s Uncle: Where have you been? Do you know how late it is, young man!?

Young Mine: Um… Me and my friends were playing baseball!

Mine’s Uncle: Oh, that's all it was? And here I was worrying you'd run away.

Young Mine: Hey, and listen to this! I got the best grade in my class on our test today!

Mine’s Uncle: Wow. I always knew you were a bright kid.

[Young Mine tries to play with the other kids…]

Young Mine: Guys! Let me play, too!

Boy: Yeah, right. You don't even have a bat and glove. There's no room in our game for poor orphanage trash! (laughs)

[And so… Mine’s Uncle dies…]

Young Mine: Dad! Get up, please!

Mine’s Uncle: Yoshitaka… 

Young Mine: Dad!

Mine’s Uncle: Yoshitaka… Listen to me. I always knew… you were the smart one. Don't put that brain to waste. …Make something of yourself.

Young Mine: Dad…

Mine’s Uncle: I'm so sorry. I can't… be there for you…

Young Mine: Dad!

[Someone knocks on the door of Mine's office, interrupting his flashback.]

Mine: Who is it?

Secretary: Katase, sir.

[Mine puts a picture of himself as a young man face down on the table.]

Mine: Come in.

Secretary Kitase: Apologies if I interrupted anything. I've booked your flight to Okinawa. It leaves from Haneda in an hour and a half.

Mine: Then let's go.

Secretary Kitase: Chairman…

Mine: What is it?

Secretary Kitase: Never mind. It's nothing. It's just… you've been working yourself awfully hard lately. If something happened to you, I…

Mine: Don't give me that look. I'll be fine.

[Mine leaves the office. Meanwhile at New Serena Date and Kiryu watching news.]

News Reporter: "After investigating the incident which took place yesterday at the National Diet Building… Authorities are convinced it came about at the hands of a group opposing the Okinawa military expansion bill. As we speak, patrols are on high alert in search of those behind the incident."

Kiryu: Mind turning that off?

Mama: Of course.

Date: Dammit. Looks like getting down to Okinawa's not gonna be as easy as we thought, huh?

Kiryu: We? Sorry, Date-san… but I need to do this alone.

Date: What? But Mine's gonna have an army of guys down there. Going without any backup is like signing your own damn death wish.

Majima: Man's got a point, Kiryu-chan. Ya ask me, we send in some of my boys, rough some people up, make sure nobody even thinks of layin' a hand on ya.

Kiryu: Look, I'll be fine on my own.

Date: Why are you being so stubborn about this?

Kiryu: The only reason I've gotten this far involved is so I can make sure Morning Glory is safe. I care about Daigo and the Tojo Clan, yeah… But when push comes to shove, this Okinawa fight is mine and mine alone.

Majima: Not anymore it ain't. Not with the CIA and those Hakuho thugs turnin' the place all topsy-turvy.

Kiryu: It'll be okay. I have friends down there.

Date: Huh?

Kiryu: The Ryudo Family. If I'm gonna be settling a fight in Okinawa, I want to do it with Okinawa natives by my side.

Majima: …Oh. And you're sure about that, Kiryu-chan?

Kiryu: One hundred percent.

Majima: S'pose that's that, then.

Date: So, what? You're just giving up, Majima?

Majima: Kiryu-chan's a big, stubborn ox. No changin' his mind when he's like this, Date-san. Ya should know that better than anyone.

Date: Even so, I…

Majima: Kiryu-chan. The Majima Family'll keep the lights on over at Tojo HQ while you're gone. Go do what you gotta do, yeah?

Kiryu: Thank you, Majima-san.

[He leaves the bar and catches a cab to the airport and flies to Okinawa.]

Kiryu: (I promised Tamiya I'd save Toma from Joji Kazama and the CIA. First things first, I'll need to find Toma. Though I want to stop by the orphanage first. The kids will be thrilled to know rm back in town.)

[He goes to the orphanage. The children is playing with a ball.]

Taichi: Uncle Kaz!

[The children surround Kiryu, cheerfully greeting him. Kiryu notices Nakaharuya sitting on the porch. Rikiya and Mikio help him.]

Kiryu: Nakahara! Are you sure you should be out of bed?

Nakahara: I've kept you waitin' long enough, brother.

Kiryu: How are you doing, Nakahara?

Nakahara: Heh, never been better. take more than a few little bits of metal to drag me down.

Rikiya: Aniki. Did you learn anythin' else about the guy who saved me?

Kiryu: …Yeah. He's actually the brother of the man who raised me as a kid. And apparently, he works for the CIA.

Rikiya: The CIA?!

Nakahara: Wait, that same guy was there when I was staring down the other side of that barrel. What's the CIA get outta shooting me, though?

Kiryu: …They're here on a mission. I can't really say much more than that, but them wanting the deed to Morning Glory's land has something to do with it.

Rikiya: What's so special about this patch of sand, though?

Kiryu: The land itself isn't what matters. It's the project they're going to build on it.

Nakahara: The resort…

Kiryu: Exactly. That, and the military expansion that hinges on Tamiya's new bill.

Mikio: I dunno if I get it, Aniki. What's the CIA gotta do with buildin' a resort? Or this military base stuff?

Rikiya: What, ya don't know, Mikio? It's simple! The CIA. they, uh… Well, they… want money! That's it, yeah! They're gonna make bank for the U.S. government!

Mikio: Wow. You sure know a lot, Rikiya!

Kiryu: That's not right at all. The point of this is to smoke out an arms smuggling syndicate which has been undermining the U.S. for years now. Once the CIA gets them out into the open, they're gonna crush them once and for all. Turns out Nakahara, Daigo, and I were all just pawns in their plan. 

Nakahara: How'd you find out about all this?

Kiryu: I heard it straight from Tamiya, the Minister of Defense.

Nakahara: Tamiya!?

Kiryu: You remember Toma, his secretary? Well, Tamiya says if we save Toma, he'll put a stop to the resort.

Nakahara: What do you mean, "save" him?

Kiryu: Toma learned too much about the connection between Tamiya and the CIA, so he decided to take matters into his own hands. And now, the CIA wants him dead.

Nakahara: Wait, but if Toma's muckin' up the works, wouldn't it be better for Tamiya if the CIA actually offed him?

Kiryu: That's not exactly Tamiya's style. He's far more honorable than that.

Nakahara: Huh, and here I thought politicians wouldn't lift a damn finger if it wasn't gonna benefit them. Good to know there are some that actually give a shit.

Kiryu: Yeah. Anyway, that's why I came back: to save Toma. Now I just need to figure out where he is.

[Someone calls Kiryu.]

Tamiya: Hello, Kiryu? It's Tamiya.

Kiryu: Hey. Any updates?

Tamiya: Where are you now?

Kiryu: Back in Okinawa. I wanted to stop by the orphanage, but I'll be heading out to look for Toma any minute now.

Tamiya: There's no need. Hell be at the prefectural office with his advisors all day long.

Kiryu: And tonight?

Tamiya: They're discussing the details of the resort deal, Kiryu. I expect this meeting to be quite lengthy. In fact, they'll more likely than not continue working through the night. As long as Toma's at the prefectural office, he'll be safe. In other words, you can rest easy for now. The real test will come tomorrow.

Kiryu: Right…

Tamiya: I'm not sure when the meeting will end… but whenever it does, Toma will instantly be in danger. Joji will undoubtedly strike at his most vulnerable moment. I have someone keeping tabs on the meeting, though. I'll contact you again when I learn where Toma's going. For today, try to get some rest for the battle ahead. I expect you'll need it. Oh, and be ready to leap into action at the drop of a hat tomorrow.

Kiryu: Will do. Talk to you later, Tamiya.

Tamiya: Farewell.

Kiryu: That was Tamiya. Sounds like Toma's gonna be tied up in a meeting until tomorrow. He's safe for now.

Nakahara: Good, good. Gives you the chance to take a load off, spend some time with your kids. They missed you somethin' fierce while you were gone.

Kiryu: Heh. I couldn't tell.

Rikiya: Haha, never seen 'em quite this pumped before. I'm sure they have tons they wanna ask you!

Nakahara: Seconded. Anyway, Rikiya, we should get goin'.

Rikiya: Oh, right.

Kiryu: Hm? Where to?

Nakahara: Just some overnight tests at the hospital. Nothing too serious. I'll swing by tomorrow, okay?

Kiryu: Yeah, sounds good.

Rikiya: We'll be back after we drop the boss off, Aniki. Later!

[Nakahara, Rikiya and Mikio leave. For a while, the children ask Kiryu about his trip to Tokyo. Tired of talking, Taichi and Mitsuo step aside.]

Taichi: Ugh, if I have to hear another word about Tokyo, I think I'm gonna puke-yo.

Mitsuo: Me, too. I dunno how Ayako-chan and Riona are still so into it.

Taichi: Guess girls like hearing about the big city or something. I wish Uncle Kaz talked about wrestling matches in Tokyo instead! I bet they show them on TV up there every single night.

Mitsuo: Uh… Maybe not every night.

Taichi: How would you know, huh!? You're not the expert on Tokyo wrestling all of a sudden, Mitsuo! You've never even been there!

Mitsuo: Well, neither have you!

Taichi: Grrr, shut up! Let's settle this in the ring!

Mitsuo: But we wrestle all the time! Can't we do something else for once?

Taichi: Come onnn! Let's just go!

Mitsuo: …Fine. But go easy on me this time!

Taichi: Yeah, yeah! Whatever you say!

[They run off to the beach.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz? Have you seen Taichi around?

Kiryu: I saw him run off to the beach with Mitsuo just now. Why, what's up?

Haruka: It's his turn to do the shopping today, but he still hasn't gone. Can you go talk some sense into him for me?

Kiryu: Sure, just a second. (All Taichi ever does is play…)

[He walks to the beach. Taichi and Mitsuo are wrestling.]

Kiryu: Taichi!

Taichi: Whaddya want, Uncle Kaz? Can't you see we're busy?

Kiryu: It's your turn to go shopping today! You can't just keep horsing around all the time while everyone else takes care of you!

Taichi: I know, just give me five more minutes!

Kiryu: Now!

Taichi: But this is a big match, Uncle Kaz! I'll go in five minutes, swear!

Kiryu: …Fine. But you're going the second you're done! You’ll be in big trouble if I hear you didn't go, do you understand? Same for you, Mitsuo!

Mitsuo: Hey, why am I getting dragged into this!? Taichi, let's just go! We can wrestle some more after we go shopping.

Taichi: You're not gonna get away that easy! Take this!

Mitsuo: Seriously?

Kiryu: (I know Taichi loves wrestling, but he really needs to start being more responsible…)

[He leaves the beach.]

Mitsuo: You're the worst, Taichi! Why do you always take this so serious!?

Taichi: That's just the beginning! But this put you outta your misery. Super Flying… Taichi Kick! 

[Taichi tries to kick Mitsuo with both feet from a sprint. Mitsuo ducks and Taichi falls to the ground.]

Mitsuo: One, two, three! Yahoo! I finally got a win! Huh? Hey! Hey, Taichi! Can you hear me, Taichi!? C'mon, get up! Oh crap! Uncle Kaz! Taichi's… Taichi's hurt! Uncle Kaz! Come quick! 

Kiryu: What's wrong!?

Mitsuo: Taichi fell on his back! He's not moving!

Kiryu: What!?

Mitsuo: (nervous) You gotta do something, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Right! You find Haruka and tell her to call the doctor, I'll go check on Taichi!

Mitsuo: Okay!

[Kiryu runs to Taichi, lying on the beach.]

Kiryu: Taichi? Taichi, can you hear me!?

Taichi: *cough* *cough*

Kiryu: (He won't stop coughing. Gotta get him inside.)

[Some time passes. The Taichi is carried into the house and placed on the futon. A doctor arrives and examines him. After the examination…]

Kiryu: How's he looking, doc?

Doctor: Hmmm. From what I can tell, it seems to be a severe case of asthma.

Kiryu: But he's never shown any signs of it before. How is that possible?

Doctor: It's difficult to say before further tests, but there are countless possible reasons for the sudden onset. It could be mere genetics, or perhaps caused by something from the environment. Cigarette smoke, pollution, what have you. There are other possibilities beyond that as well.

Taichi: Ngh…

Rikiya: Whaddya mean, “other possibilities”?

Doctor: Well you see, kids these days are subject to a much higher level of stress than we were back in the day. Not only that, but this child is an orphan, yes?

Kiryu: Yeah, but…

Doctor: This is simple conjecture, but this could be arising now as a result of the great stress Taichi must have gone through as a young boy. He may still be a child, but I suspect there are traumatic experiences hiding just under the surface.

Kiryu: And that can seriously cause asthma?

Doctor: It's entirely possible. In any case, strenuous exercise is off the table from now on. We can say with near complete certainty that wrestling was the cause of this attack.

Kiryu: But…

Doctor: There are no “buts” to this, sir! Your child's health is at serious risk!

Kiryu: Risk? What do you mean?

Doctor: The potential complications of asthma reach far beyond the coughing and shortness of breath so often associated with it. If left untreated, this could very well become a chronic issue for your boy. He may someday be unable to breathe on his own. Worst case scenario, it may ultimately be fatal.

Haruka: What!?

Doctor: So, for the time being I would suggest he take it easy and avoid exercise of any kind until we have the test results.

[He leaves.]

Kiryu: I had no idea this was so serious…

Haruka: Does this mean Taichi's gonna have to stop wrestling? It'll break his heart…

Rikiya: Well, let's not go jumpin' to any conclusions before we get those test results, yeah? I'm gonna go check on him.

Kiryu: (Guess I'll go, too. lfd be good to cheer him up somehow…)

[He walks to the room.]

Rikiya: C’mon Taichi, it's beautiful out. How 'bout you and me head out for a nice relaxin' fish?

Taichi: Nah.

Rikiya: Oh… Well it's no fun sittin' in here, right? Let's get you out in the sun!

Taichi: Just leave me alone!

Rikiya: But…

Taichi: You want me to go outside? Fine, then let's wrestle!

Rikiya: Oh. Well, uh… Maybe later, okay?

Taichi: Later? More like never! I heard what the doctor was saying! I've got asthma! I'm gonna die if I keep wrestling! But wrestling's the only thing I wanna do. I wanna go pro and make tons of money so I can help Morning Glory… It’s… It's the only thing I'm good at…

Kiryu: Taichi. You just need to find another way.

Taichi: Something other than wrestling, huh…

Kiryu: That's not what I mean. Wrestling is your dream, right?

Taichi: …Yeah.

Kiryu: Then you can't give it up.

Taichi: Huh?

Kiryu: Don't lose sight of your dream, no matter what.

Taichi: I… don't get it, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: Look, everyone faces obstacles on their path through life. It just so happens that the first obstacle you have to face is this asthma thing. So for now, just be patient. Pushing yourself could make it far worse, and running yourself into the ground is no better than abandoning your dream altogether.

Taichi: I…

Kiryu: All you can do now is wait. Stay calm. Start making plans for when you get better. Understand?

Taichi: …Yeah.

Kiryu: And you will get better, I'm sure of it. Then once you do, it'll be all systems go on the path to your dream.

Rikiya: He's right, Taichi! Even if you can't do stuff now, you'll be back in butt-kickin' action in no time flat! And hey, watchin' other people wrestle's still pretty fun, right? No better way to study moves, if ya ask me! Wait, that's it! Well put on a special match for you since you're sidelined n' all! Ain't that right, Aniki!?

Kiryu: Uh…

[They leave the house.]

Kiryu: So, what's this about a special match?

Rikiya: Just think about it, Aniki! You and me puttin' on a masked wrestling show, just like they do on TV!

Kiryu: You… want to wrestle me?

Rikiya: For Taichi! I think it'll really lift his spirits.

Kiryu: True. Guess it's worth a try.

Rikiya: Aw man, he's gonna love it! Me and Mikio'll get started buildin' the ring right away!

Kiryu: A ring? You're really serious about this, huh?

Rikiya: 'Course I am! No point doin' something if you're gonna do it half-assed, y'know? Don't worry, we'll handle everything. Oh, and I'll let you know when we're ready. You might wanna warm up first—I got some pretty mean moves!

Kiryu: Heh, we'll see about that.

[Rikiya runs away. Kiryu decides to take a stroll through the city and then he comes back with everything already set up. There’s a handmade ring on the beach.]

Rikiya: Ring's all prepped, Aniki! You ready to rumble?

Kiryu: Sure, let's do it.

Rikiya: Sweet, let's go change into our costumes somewhere the kids won't see us!

Kiryu: Right.

[The match begins! Dragon Mask and Ricky Mask enter the ring! Dragon Mask shows the kids some moves and throws Ricky Mask on the floor. Suddenly Rick Mask pulls out a fork…]

Taichi: Dragon! Look out!

[He enters the ring and pushes Ricky Mask.]

Kiryu: Taichi!

Ricky Mask: Hold on I was just—

Taichi: Super Flying… Taichi Kick! Eat this!

[He kicks Ricky Mask and holds him.]

Mikio: One! Two! Three!

Kiryu: You all right, Taichi?

Taichi: Huh? I feel… great.

[The doctor runs in.]

Doctor: Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: Hey, doc. Is something wrong?

Doctor: The boy! What did the boy eat before he collapsed?

Kiryu: That was just around lunchtime, so… Haruka. What did you guys have for lunch today?

Haruka: Soba! We got them from a noodle shop a few blocks away.

Doctor: Just as I thought. The blood tests I ran showed extremely high allergen levels, meaning Taichi's attack was in fact due to an allergic reaction to whatever he had for lunch.

Kiryu: In other words… buckwheat.

Haruka: Taichi did keep talking about how good it was. He probably ate twice as much as the other kids.

Kiryu: I guess that means he can't have soba anymore, huh?

Doctor: It would be prudent to avoid it, yes. As with any severe allergic reaction, it could cause his airways to swell up, greatly restricting his ability to breathe. In extreme cases, he may even go into anaphylactic shock. It's difficult to overstate just how dangerous this could potentially be for your boy.

Kiryu: I had no idea…

Doctor: But if we can take heart from something, it's the fact that he ate an especially large amount of soba before collapsing. It may be a mere minor allergy in regular quantities. In some cases, people have even been known to grow out of childhood food allergies as they mature. You simply never know what the future may hold. I must encourage caution, though. Nowadays it's very easy to eat a food containing buckwheat without even realizing it's one of the ingredients.

Kiryu: Right.

Doctor: I imagine he won't mind very much, though. It seems Taichi would gladly give up soba if it means he's able to wrestle again.

Kiryu: (So Taichi's allergic to buckwheat. Guess we'll need to be more careful about what we eat from now on. Still nothing from Tamiya, too. Looks like Tomas gonna be stuck in that meeting all day, just like he said.)

[He bumps into Haruka.]

Haruka: Oh! 

Kiryu: Haruka? What's the rush? You could have really gotten hurt if I wasn't paying attention.

Haruka: Huh? Oh, um… IVs nothing! Just thought rd go get some groceries for dinner.

Kiryu: Perfect, I'll come with you.

Haruka: Oh! You, um… You don't need to do that, Uncle Kaz! I'm sure you're tired after your trip down here! Oh, and all that wrestling, too! You should relax!

Kiryu: I actually feel pretty fine.

Haruka: That's what you say now, but you'll be complaining later if you don't have any downtime. See you later, Uncle Kaz!

[She runs away.]

Kiryu: (That was… strange. I wonder if she's really going shopping. Wait. She's not going on a date, is she!?)

(Maybe I should see what she's up to.) 
(I can't spy on her!) ✓

Kiryu: (What am I thinking? I can't spy on her! Besides, she's getting to be that age. Going on a date here or there might not be the worst thing in the world for her. Even so… I should probably be there to protect her if anything happens.)

(Yeah. That sounds plausible.)
(No!) ✓

Kiryu: (No! I can't spy on my kids! Maybe a nice walk on the beach will take my mind off this…)

Ayako: Uncle Kaz! Have you seen Haruka?

Kiryu: Yeah, just now. She said she was going shopping.

Ayako: Darn, I must've just missed her! She forgot her shopping list on the table, too… Knowing Haruka, I'm sure she has the whole thing memorized, but maybe I should run after her just in case.

Kiryu: Wait! I'll give it to her.

Ayako: Huh? But you just got back. I don't mind going if you're too tired, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: I was actually just thinking of taking a walk downtown anyway. It's been way too long.

Ayako: But it was just three days…

Kiryu: Yeah, well… it felt a lot longer than that. Either way, I could use a nice walk.

Ayako: If you say so! Here.

Kiryu: Thanks, Ayako. I'll make sure she gets it.

[He finds Haruka on the streets of the city. She reads an advertisement on a pole.]

Haruka: A job, huh…?

Kiryu: (Haruka? What is she doing here?) Haruka? Is everything okay?

Haruka: Oh, uh, Uncle Kaz! It’s… It's nothing, nope! I was just about to head over to the market! (runs in the opposite direction)

Kiryu: Haruka, wait! (What was she looking at? Probably this help wanted poster… Hm. If she was really here to go shopping, she wouldn't be hanging around in Hatsumachi. Something's fishy here.)

[He decides to follow Haruka, trying not to attract her attention. He finds her talking with some suspicious men at the parking lot.]

Shady Man: It's a total piece of cake, sweet cheeks. No tougher than handin' out a few flyers. You seen people doin' that before, right?

Haruka: Yeah, I guess so…

Suspicious Man: You should be thanking your lucky stars we're givin' you this shot, girlie. We got kids floodin' our office nonstop just begging for a chance to rake in the dough with us. Now, all you gotta do is take these envelopes, and hand 'em over to any ol' schmuck who asks you for one. Do that, and they'll pay you a cool 20,000 yen.

[He hands Haruka the envelopes. Kiryu walks up.]

Kiryu: Haruka? What are you doing?

Haruka: Oh, Uncle Kaz!

Shady Man: Well, looks like that's our cue. Catch ya 'round, little lady!

[They runs away.]

Kiryu: Haruka. Who were those guys?

Haruka: Oh, uh… Nobody! Just some people asking for directions! Well, look at the time! The shopping can't wait forever! (runs away)

Kiryu: Haruka! (I don't like the look of this.)

[He looks for Haruka again. She hands out envelopes on the bridge.]

Sleazy-looking Host: You the kid, huh? Gimme one.

Haruka: Um… here.

Kiryu: (That guy looked like some kind of host… Definitely not the right age to be her boyfriend, at the very least.)

Peppy Punk: Yo! Hit me up with that envelope!

Haruka: Oh, right. Urn… here.

Kiryu: (Well that was just your run-of-the-mill punk. Definitely not boyfriend material, not to mention the right age.)

Well-dressed Yakuza: Hey, kid. I'll take one.

Haruka: Right… Here you go.

Kiryu: (No doubt about it. That guy was yakuza. And decades too old to even think about being Haruka's boyfriend…)

[He approaches Haruka.]

Kiryu: Haruka? What are you doing here?

Haruka: Oh, um… Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: What were you talking to all those men about?

Haruka: Oh, er… Just saying how nice the weather is! Nothing better than a beautiful sunny day, haha! Anyway, I really should get shopping now! It's almost dinnertime! (runs away)

Kiryu: Haruka, wait! (She has to be hiding something… It’s just about dinnertime, though, so she'll be heading home any minute now. Guess I should do the same.)

[He gets back to the orphanage. All the children sit at the table. On the table are two large pans of sukiyaki, a kind of soup with thinly sliced beef, tofu and vegetables. Children are very happy with such an infrequent dish.]

Kiryu: Sukiyaki, huh? We're eating like kings tonight. What's the occasion?

Haruka: I guess I'm just getting better at saving money.

[Mikio is standing on the doorstep.]

Mikio: Anyone home? 

[Kiryu goes out to him.]

Mikio: Sir. There's something I gotta tell you.

Kiryu: What's up?

Mikio: I saw Haruka talkin' to two thugs in town today. Almost like she knew 'em. But just one glance was enough to tell me those guys were no good. Not at all.

[Kiryu is not very happy about this news. He turns his head and looks at Haruka. The children are having fun in anticipation of a delicious lunch.]

Haruka: Enjoy, everyone!

[After the lunch…]

One of the children offscreen: Wow, that was incredible!

Taichi: Yeah, sukiyaki's the bomb!

Ayako: Mitsuo, Riona. It's your turn to do the dishes tonight. Go get started, okay?

Mitsuo: Going!

Haruka: By the way, Uncle Kaz. There's, um… something I need to do in town, so I'm gonna go out for a bit.

Kiryu: No you're not. It's not safe for a young girl to be out this late.

Haruka: It won't be too long, promise. Bye! (runs away)

Kiryu: (…First all that suspicious stuff this afternoon, then what Mikio told me, and now this. Probably wouldn't hurt to go keep an eye on her.)

Find Haruka
[Kiryu finds Haruka at the same parking lot and hides around the corner.]

Kiryu: (There she is. What is she up…?)

Suspicious Man: Nice seein' ya, little lady. Forgot to mention a teensy tiny something earlier: If you spot a cop strolling over towards you, turn heel and casually go the other way.

Haruka: Huh? Why? I'm not doing anything illegal, am I?

Suspicious Man: Oh, no no no! Not at all! There are just, uh… laws about how much a kid your age is allowed to make. Truth is, we're payin' you even more than we're supposed to. But hey, you need the dough, we need the help. Win-win, you know what I mean?

Haruka: I guess…

Suspicious Man: Anyways, just do what ya did this afternoon and it'll be blue skies and green pastures from now on. Green, like the cash you're gonna rake in!

[They hide behind the corner. The suspicious man got a call.]

Suspicious Man: Hey, yeah. We got the stuff. Girl's chillin' by a vending machine in the parking lot. Hand her the stacks and she'll give you what you want.

Laidback Man: (to Haruka) Here, gimme one.

Shady Man: Shit, a copper!

Suspicious Man: Let's just see what happens, yeah?

[Haruka manages to drive the policeman away.]

Shady Man: Heh, kid's got a good head on her shoulders.

Suspicious Man: Donut-eatin' bastard didn't suspect a damn thing. Plus even if they did catch the girl, we'd still be flyin' sky-high. Phone's registered to a fake name, after all. I'd take this over some creepy-ass dark web shit any day.

Shady Man: You're a friggin' genius, Aniki!

[They get back to Haruka.]

Shady Man: That was just what we're lookin' for, kid. Ya might even earn yourself a nice little bonus if ya keep puttin' the coppers off your tail like that.

Haruka: Oh… Really?

Suspicious Man: You betcha. Anyways, when a customer comes, ya give 'em the envelope and take the two grand. If a cop comes, ya give 'em the slip. Pretty simple, yeah? We'll check back in later. Good luck!

Haruka: Thanks…

[The thug leaves.]

Kiryu: (These are the same guys I saw Haruka with earlier. Mikio must have been talking about them, too. Guess I'm gonna have to ask Haruka about this directly…)

[A client approaches Haruka.]

Kiryu: Hm? (Another sleazeball talking to Haruka… What should I do? Interrupt them?)

Step In
Wait and See ✓

Kiryu: (Even if I stepped in, I don't think Haruka would tell me anything. Guess I'll just wait and see what happens. This guy's yakuza through and through. What now? Interrupt them?)

Step In
Wait and See ✓

Kiryu: (Yet another “customer”… Hm. Interrupt them?)

Step In
Wait and See ✓

Kiryu: (This one's a cop! What should I do? Interrupt them?)

Step In
Wait and See ✓

Kiryu: (Maybe I'll just wait a little longer… Wait, those are the punks Haruka was with earlier. Interrupt them?)

Step In ✓
Wait and See

Shady Man: That's what I'm talkin' about! Good work, girlie!

Suspicious Man: Here ya go. 10 grand. Don't spend it all in one place, heh!

Haruka: Thank you very much.

Kiryu: That's a lot of money. What's it for?

Suspicious Man: Huh? Who the hell're you, man!?

[He drops the envelope. Inside are green fake credit cards.]

Shady Man: Uhhh…

Haruka: Uncle Kaz…

Kiryu: Counterfeit credit cards? You two should be ashamed of yourselves for using a child in some two-bit scam!

Shady Man: Aw, shit! Who are you!?

Suspicious Man: Doesn't matter who he is. He better get walkin' if he ever wants to walk again.

Kiryu: I'm not going anywhere. It's time I teach you what happens when you take advantage of a helpless child.

[He kicks their asses.]

Kiryu: Haruka…

Haruka: I…

[Rikiya and Mikio run in.]

Rikiya: Aniki!

Kiryu: Rikiya, Mikio. What's wrong?

Rikiya: Mikio told me all ‘bout the thugs he saw our Haruka-chan with. So I swung by Morning Glory, but you and Haruka-chan were gone. I'd heard word ‘bout these guys in Hatsumachi pumpin' out counterfeit credit cards, though, so I figured they were the ones Haruka-chan got mixed up with… and now here I am.

Haruka: Um…

Kiryu: What were you thinking, Haruka? You could have been in serious danger.

Haruka: I… I heard Uncle Rikiya and Uncle Mikio talking.

Kiryu: About what?

Haruka: They were saying money was really tight.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Haruka: They said the cost to feed us and the rent were both going up… That we might not make rent this month.

[You see a flashback of that very conversation… Rikiya and Mikio talking on the porch of the orphanage.]

Rikiya: Things aren't lookin' so hot, huh?

Mikio: You're dang right they're not. I did some figuring, and we're really gonna have to start scrimpin'.

Rikiya: Sucks how quick they spring those rent hikes on ya. Can't forget the food bill either. Everyone eats truckloads.

Mikio: We can't afford to spend another yen, though. Next month's rent's gonna be tight. Way too tight for comfort.

Rikiya: I get it, I get it! But what can we do?

Mikio: What'd Kiryu-aniki have to say?

Rikiya: Didn't tell him. I don't want him worryin'.

Mikio: Then, maybe if we… chip in—

Rikiya: Dumbass! We can't help if we can barely support ourselves!

Mikio: Guess so, huh.

[Meanwhile, Haruka was standing nearby, eavesdropping on the conversation. Back to the parking lot.]

Rikiya: You, uh… You heard that, huh?

Haruka: …Yeah.

Mikio: Ha! Haha! Hahahahaha!

Haruka: Uncle Mikio?

Mikio: Ya got it all wrong, Haruka-chan. We were talking about the Ryudo office, not you guys!

Haruka: Huh? But what about the rent? And the food bill? You said everyone eats truckloads…

Mikio: This is all one big misunderstanding. The only place they're raisin' the rent for is our office. As for the food… I'm the only one in this town who eats like a truck, let's be honest. Heh.

Rikiya: What're you proud of that for!?

Haruka: That's really all it was? What a relief! Are you gonna be okay, though?

Rikiya: Eh, we'll figure something out. First step is puttin' our big boy Mikio here on a nice, looong diet!

Haruka: Hehehe! Well if you ever want a nice hearty meal, you're always welcome at Morning Glory!

Rikiya: Welp, Aniki. Guess this is where we take our leave.

Kiryu: Thanks for clearing all this up.

Rikiya: Aw, no problem. Anyways, me n' the boss'll pop by tomorrow. Later!

Haruka: Bye!

[Rikiya and Mikio leave.]

Kiryu: We should probably head home, too. It's getting late.

Haruka: …I'm sorry, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: It's okay, Haruka. I'm just glad you're safe. Oh, and promise me you'll never get involved in something like that again.

Haruka: I won't, I promise!

[They go back to the orphanage.]

Haruka: Wow, it got so late!

Kiryu: Heh, yeah. It's almost time for you kids to get to bed.

Haruka: I think I'm gonna take a bath first! Can you check on the others for me while I'm in there, Uncle Kaz? Make sure they've all taken baths, and ask how their homework's coming along while you're at it!

Kiryu: Heh, I think I can do that.

[He approaches Koji and Taichi, watching TV.]
Kiryu: Hey, you two. Have you taken your baths?

Taichi: Mmm, not yet.

Koji: I'll do it when this show's over!

Kiryu: And your homework?

Taichi: I'll do it when this show's over, too!

Koji: Not me. I don't have any homework today, heheh!

Taichi: Mannn, seriously? I get mountains of it every night! I wish my teacher'd just give us a break…

Kiryu: Complaining won't get it done any quicker. Go on.

Taichi: Ugh, fiiine…

[Kiryu approaches Shiro and Eri.]

Kiryu: Hey, are you two all clean and shiny?

Shiro: Yup! I took my bath a little while ago.

Eri: Me too!

Kiryu: Good. And how's your homework coming along?

Eri: All finished!

Shiro: I'm mostly done… but I still have grammar to do. I'm so bad at it.

Kiryu: All the more reason to do your homework and study, right?

Shiro: I mean, yeah… but I just don't get how it even works.

Kiryu: That's okay. If you always avoid things that are difficult, you'll never be able to grow. Owning up to your weaknesses and facing them head-on is the best way to improve.

Shiro: Okay. I'll try.

Kiryu: And hey, studying can be pretty fun once you get the hang of it. Why don't you ask Ayako to give you a hand? I'm sure she'd be more than glad to help you out.

[He approaches Riona and Mitsuo in the kitchen.]

Kiryu: Hey, you two. Are the dishes all done?

Mitsuo: Yup, we finished ages ago!

Kiryu: And have you taken your baths?

Mitsuo: Oh, uh… Not yet.

Riona: I took one before dinner!

Kiryu: Well Mitsuo, you'll have to wait until Haruka gets out. How's your homework coming along?

Riona: I did that before dinner, too!

Mitsuo: I, uh… Haha… Ha…

Kiryu: I'll take that as a no. You should be more proactive about getting your chores done. Riona did everything before dinner and now she has the rest of the night to just relax.

Mitsuo: All riiight.

Mitsuo: Hey, Riona, think you could help me with my homework since you're sooo free?

Riona: Do it yourself! You'll never get a girlfriend with that kind of attitude.

[Kiryu evedrops Izumi and Ayako.]

Izumi: Ayako-chan. Ayako-chan! I saw the cutest little dog toy at the pet store today! My old dog used to have a toy just like it, so I'm sure Mame would love it! Can I borrow some money to get it for him? Pleeease?

Ayako: (I wonder how much it costs. I only have a little more than 500 yen of my allowance left…) How much do you need, Izumi-chan?

Izumi: Ummm! I think it's 500 yen?

Ayako: (That's practically all I have left. And there's still a few more days until I get more allowance…)

Izumi: Pleeeeeease! Mame's gonna love it!

Ayako: …All right.

Izumi: Yay! Thanks, Ayako-chan! (runs away)

Ayako: Ngh…

[Shiro enters the room.]

Shiro: Ayako-chan…

Ayako: Shiro? What's wrong?

Shiro: My… My… My teacher's so mean!

Ayako: Hey, calm down. What happened?

Shiro: He thinks I cheated on our math test 'cause I got a perfect score, and wouldn't believe me when I tried telling him the truth! He just called me a liar and gave me a bunch of extra homework as punishment… Grammar homework. I don't get it at all…

Ayako: Don't worry, Shiro. I'll help you out in a bit, okay?

Shiro: Really!? Thanks, Ayako-chan!

[Shiro leaves and Kiryu enters.]

Kiryu: Ayako.

Ayako: …Hi, Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: Have you taken your bath yet?

Ayako: I was just about to, yeah. I think Haruka-chan's in there now.

Kiryu: She'll be out any second, I'm sure. By the way, Ayako…

Ayako: Huh? What is it?

Kiryu: It's just… you spend so much time putting other people's needs before your own.

Ayako: Of course I do. They need me. Oh, I think I hear Haruka-chan getting out of the bath! I should go jump in.

Kiryu: Right…

[Ayako leaves. Haruka walks out from around the corner.]

Haruka: Phew, nothing like a nice, refreshing bath!

Kiryu: Haruka.

Haruka: Oh, hi, Uncle Kaz. Is something wrong?

Kiryu: It's Ayako.

Haruka: Ayako-chan? What about her?

[Kiryu tells her what he hear.]

Haruka: Hmm. I see…

Kiryu: I mean, it's great that she puts so much effort into making sure everyone else is okay, but I'm honestly kinda worried she's not taking care of herself.

Haruka: Huh? Why do you say that?

Kiryu: Not sure. IVs just the impression I get.

Haruka: …Honestly, I've kinda been feeling the same way. I'm sure Ayako-chan thinks she has to take care of everyone else since she's older than they are. She almost treats it like some kind of job. I keep offering help, too, but she turns me down flat every time. Plus…

Kiryu: Plus what?

Haruka: I think the other kids ask her for stuff they're too afraid to ask me for. They probably think I'd get mad at them. And Ayako-chan's so nice that she can't say no, no matter what they ask for. She barely thinks of herself.

Kiryu: Yeah, I think you're right…

THE NEXT DAY

Ayako: Hmm. What should we make for dinner tonight, Haruka-chan?

Haruka: Good question… I wonder what the others feel like having.

Ayako: Oh, Izumi-chan! Did you end up getting that new toy for Mame? He must have been so happy when you brought it home for him!

Izumi: Oh, that? They were all sold out.

Ayako: And what about the 500 yen I lent you?

Izumi: Me and my friend used it to buy some candy! It was soooooo good!

[She leaves. Shiro enters.]

Ayako: What's wrong, Shiro? More homework?

Shiro: Nuh-uh… I handed in the homework you helped me with yesterday, but my teacher got real mad because it wasn't 400 words like he said it should be. He gave me detention and everything!

Ayako: Huh? I didn't realize it had to be a certain length…

Shiro: But it said it right in the top corner of the page! Ugh, if you're gonna help, at least try to do it right! I'm just gonna get even more grammar homework now…

Haruka: That's not very nice, Shiro! Ayako-chan took time out of her night to help you! You should be grateful!

[Shiro leaves. Ayako puts her head down.]

Haruka: Ayako-chan…

[Ayako runs out of the house.]

Kiryu: Hm? Ayako?

Haruka: Ayako-chan, wait!

Kiryu: Haruka? What happened?

Haruka: Well, um…

[She tells Kiryu what happened. Kiryu gathers the children around the dinner table…]

Taichi: Huh? Where's Ayako?

Kiryu: Listen up everyone.

Shiro: What's going on, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: It's Ayako.

Taichi: Huh? What about her?

Kiryu: (These kids need to realize how much Ayako does for them. I better talk to each of them one by one. Now, who's up?)

Shiro ✓
Mitsuo
Koji
Taichi
Izumi
Eri
Riona

Kiryu: Shiro. When you needed help with your homework last night, who did you go to?

Shiro: Huh? Ayako-Chan, but…

Kiryu: No buts. She had her own work to worry about, but she still took the time to make sure you got the help you needed. And what did you say to her today, Shiro?

Shiro: Um…

Kiryu: (Now, who's up?)

Mitsuo ✓
Koji
Taichi
Izumi
Eri
Riona

Kiryu: Mitsuo.

Mitsuo: Uh… yeah?

Kiryu: Remember that fight you got in the other day? Do you know who went to apologize to the boy's parents?

Mitsuo: Wait, that was Ayako-chan?

Kiryu: That’s right.

Mitsuo: She didn't have to do that. It was just a little scuffle.

Kiryu: A little scuffle that left the other boy with a broken bone. He fractured one in his hand when he fell. Ayako's apology is the only thing that kept it from boiling over into a much bigger issue.

Mitsuo: Oh… I guess that's why she kept telling me to go say I was sorry…

Kiryu: (Now, who's up?)

Koji ✓
Taichi
Izumi
Eri
Riona

Kiryu: Koji.

Koji: What, me?

Kiryu: You. Ayako always patches you up when you get hurt playing baseball, right? How often do you thank her for that?

Koji: Well, um…

Kiryu: (Now, who's up?)

Taichi ✓
Izumi
Eri
Riona

Kiryu: Taichi.

Taichi: What?

Kiryu: Remember when you collapsed from your buckwheat allergy?

Taichi: Yeah…

Kiryu: Did you ever think about who rushed to call the doctor for you? It was Ayako.

Taichi: I…

Kiryu: (Now, who's up?)

Izumi ✓
Eri
Riona

Kiryu: Izumi.

Izumi: Uh-huh?

Kiryu: Ayako gave you that 500 yen to buy a nice new toy for Mame. How do you think she felt when you told her you just bought candy for you and your friend instead?

Izumi: Um…

Kiryu: (Now, who's up?)

Eri ✓
Riona

Kiryu: Eri.

Eri: Yeah…?

Kiryu: You and Ayako had a fight the other day. But she didn't hold a grudge. She forgave you right away and still treated you just the same as she always does, didn't she?

Eri: Yeah…

Kiryu: (Now, who's up?)

Riona ✓

Kiryu: Riona.

Riona: Me? I didn't do anything.

Kiryu: Who gave you those clothes?

Riona: Well, uh… It was Ayako-chan. So what?

Kiryu: She got those for you because she knew how embarrassed you were about the burn scar on your arm. Have you ever been that considerate toward any of the other kids sitting at this table?

Riona: Well…

Haruka: I don't think you guys realize how much Ayako-chan does for all of us. And you definitely aren't grateful for it. But we're a family, right? We should be there for each other.

Kiryu: Agreed. Now… I'm going to find Ayako. (leaves the room)

Haruka: It's okay. Uncle Kaz will bring her back and we can all show just how much we appreciate her!

Find Ayako
Kiryu: (Time to bring Ayako home. She must have gone downtown…)

[He finds Ayoro near the lockers.]

Kiryu: Ayako. I've been looking all over for you.

Ayako: Uncle Kaz…?

Kiryu: Come on. Let's go home.

Ayako: No! I'm not going back! (runs away)

Kiryu: Ayako, wait!

Follow Ayako
[Kiryu runs after Ayako and eventually catches with her in an alley.]

Kiryu: Ayako… I need you to listen to me.

Ayako: No! I'm always doing stuff for other people! I don't care about Morning Glory anymore!

Kiryu: Ayako!

[She runs away again. Kiryu catches her on the bridge.]

Kiryu: *pant* *pant* Ayako… Stop running. Please, just listen to me. Ayako, please!

[Finally Ayako gets exhausted.]

Kiryu: *pants* I didn't realize… you were such a good runner…

Ayako: Darn it… I’m too tired…

Kiryu: Then listen to what I have to say. Please, Ayako. Ayako…

Ayako: ……

Kiryu: I need you to believe me when I say I'm grateful for everything you do for us, Ayako. So is Haruka. And so are all the others. I know they ask a lot of you. And I know they don't thank you enough. But that doesn't mean they don't appreciate you. And it certainly doesn't mean they don't love you.

Ayako: (cries) Uncle Kaz…

Kiryu: So, come on. How about we head home?

[They return to the orphanage. All the children line up in the yard.]

Ayako: Everyone!

Shiro: Ayako-chan. Thanks for always helping me. This is for you.

Ayako: What is it? 

[He holds out several beautiful cards with handwritten text ごはん買い出い お手伝いけん (Help you to buy rice /or food in general/). I’m no Japanese expert or anything but I think there’s some bad grammar in this text! The official translation is “Shopping Coupon”.]

Eri: Sorry. And thanks, for everything.

[He holds out several beautiful cards with handwritten text おせんたく おてつだいけん. Honestly, I don't know how to translate it, maybe there is some childish vocabulary. The best I could do was "Help you with anything." The official translation is “Laundry Coupon” probably because the card has laundry on a rope.]

Mitsuo: I've got one, too!

Ayako: You guys…

Mitsuo: Everyone's gonna pitch in and help you, Ayako-chan. It's the least we can do.

Taichi: This last one's from me.

Ayako: A Homework Coupon?

Mitsuo: Who'd want that!? You can barely do your own homework!

Koji: Yeah, that's just giving her more work!

Taichi: Huh!?

[Everyone laughs.]

Ayako: (crying) Thank you, everyone! Thank you so much!

[Later…]

Kiryu: (Morning Glory really came together to cheer Ayako up. I have a feeling everyone's gonna get along better from now on. I still haven't heard from Tamiya, though. He was supposed to give me another call today…)

[Nakahara, Rikiya, Mikio and Saki walk in the orphanage.]

Nakahara: Ahoy there, brother!

Kiryu: Good seeing you, Nakahara. How did your tests go?

Nakahara: Oh, just peachy. Passed all of 'em with flying colors! Sounds like it won't be much longer 'til I'm right as rain.

Rikiya: Only if you get enough rest, Boss! You should be in bed right now, not out and about!

Nakahara: Eh, I can rest when I'm dead! Hahaha!

Kiryu: Heh, I think he's gonna be just fine.

[He gets a call.]

Tamiya: Kiryu? It's me.

Kiryu: Tamiya. I've been waiting to hear from you. Where's Toma?

Tamiya: His meeting with the Prefectural Assembly just ended. My informant seems to believe he's on his way to celebrate with a drink. Perhaps many more than just one.

Kiryu: Got it. I have to wonder, though. If you have eyes on Toma, why don't you just have your guy tell him what's going on? It seems like that's the easiest way to protect him.

Tamiya: My operative is not only a valuable asset to me, but a prominent Okinawan politician as well. Revealing his identity would undoubtedly hinder future progress for the island. Not to mention the fact that Toma no longer trusts me. It was his decision to leave, after all.

Kiryu: True, he probably wouldn't even think of listening to your informant after that. So, what's the plan? Do you know where he went drinking?

Tamiya: Hatsumachi, most likely.

Kiryu: Any idea what bar?

Tamiya: There are several that I recall him frequenting. We hopped around quite a few places when he brought me down there. But come to think of it, there was one that he seemed to love more than any other. It was a bar specializing in pole dancing… though it seems I'm having trouble recalling the name.

Kiryu: A pole-dancing bar in Hatsumachi. Got it.

Tamiya: Please, Kiryu. Toma doesn't deserve the fate that Joji would lead him to.

Kiryu: I'll handle it. You focus on stopping the resort. The land acquisition part of it, at least.

Tamiya: You needn't worry about that. Unlike most politicians nowadays, I am a man of my word.

Kiryu: Glad to hear it. Later, Tamiya. (A pole-dancing bar in Hatsumachi, huh?)

Rikiya: All good over there, Aniki?

Kiryu: Tamiya just told me where he thinks Toma is.

Rikiya: Guess that means you're headin' out, then?

Kiryu: That's the plan. Can the two of you keep an eye on the kids for me while I'm gone?

Rikiya: Don't you worry, Aniki. Well watch 'em like a friggin' hawk! Oh… and be careful, yeah?

Kiryu: I will.

[Kiryu goes downtown and, after wandering around Hatsumachi for a while, finds a barker.]

Canal Grande Barker: You ever seen a girl contort herself on a big metal pole, sir? You want to? I promise, you've never seen anything like it!

Kiryu: (…This must be where Toma is.)

Canal Grande Barker: What do you say, sir? The show's just about to start!

Don’t Go Inside
Go Inside ✓

Kiryu: Sure, I'll take a look. 

Canal Grande Barker: Wonderful, sir! Is there a specific hostess you'd like to request?

Kiryu: No, thanks. This is actually my first time here.

Canal Grande Barker: Oh, excellent! Right this way, my amateur friend!

[Kiryu enjoys the magnificent show of dancing girls while looking out for Toma. He finds him on the top floor.]

Toma: I'm the freaking savior of Okinawa, baby! 

Hostess: (clapping) Wow!

Toma: The island's future is brighter than ever! Everyone's gonna remember the legend of Toma!

Hostess:トマちゃん カッコイイ! (You’re so cool, Toma-chan!)

[Toma laughs. Kiryu notices Joji going upstairs to Toma and runs to him from the other side.]

Toma: Well? Aren't I the best? Course I am! Now come on, bottoms up!

[As usual, without a word, Joji pulls a gun out of his pocket and points it at Toma. The girls scatter in terror. Toma remains sitting motionless, stunned with fear.]

Kiryu: Don't do it! Tamiya told me everything. Why you shot Nakahara and Daigo. Why you're about to put a bullet between Toma eyes.

Toma: He's gonna… kill me!?

Kiryu: Tamiya sent me To stop you from making this mistake. I don't care if it came from the top of the CIA. This can't be what you want.

Tama: The CIA? Then that means…

Toma: Minister Tamiya's gonna have me killed!

[He drops the glass and tries to escape. Joji shoots… hitting a few centimeters from Toma's head.]

Joji: Not another step.

Kiryu: Joji. Are you really going to kill Toma?

Joji: Kazuma Kiryu, yes? You of all people should know. When your chairman tells you to do something, you damn well do it.

Kiryu: What?

Joji: And the CIA is my "chairman." They say I need to kill someone, no matter the target… I'm going to kill them. (to Toma) I'll see you in hell.

[Kiryu realizes that Tom is about to be killed and rushes toward Joji. He knocks him to the floor. Joji's gun flies under the couch.]

Kiryu: (to Toma) Go!

[Toma runs away.]

Joji: What do you think you're doing?

Kiryu: I saved Toma… and now it's your turn. That's the promise I made Tamiya.

Joji: Tamiya, huh? He was always so naive. 

Kiryu: You're not killing anyone else. I'm gonna make sure of it.

Joji: I'm merely following orders. If you want to stop me… you know what comes next.

Kiryu: Yeah. There's only one way to solve this. With our fists.

Joji: I see why my brother took a shine to you. You're brighter than you look. But his blood flows through my veins. Can you truly fight me?

Kiryu: Let's find out. Blood isn't what matters, though. Me and Kazama-san… Our bond was far stronger than that.

Joji: Show me, then. Just how strong it was. Now, Kazuma Kiryu. We fight!

[Kiryu accepts the challenge and fights the old man. Not without a bit of sweat he defeats him.]

Joji: I've grown too old for this. Fighting's a young man's game.

Kiryu: If you were any younger… I'm not so sure I would've won.

Joji: But you did win. So just like Tamiya asked… I'll stay away from the kid. I promise.

Kiryu: The kid? Toma!

[He stands just behind Kiryu.]

Toma: Kiryu-san. Did Minister Tamiya really ask you to come here?

Kiryu: That's right.

Toma: But why? Why would he put you through so much… just to save me?

Kiryu: Tamiya cares about you.

Toma: He does?

Kiryu: He does.

Toma: But… why? I betrayed him, left for Mine!

Kiryu: Tamiya would never lose faith in you over something like that. He admires just how devoted you are to Okinawa. He told me as much. And not only that. He thinks you'll flourish into a great politician someday.

Toma: (kneels and starts crying) Minister… Minister Tamiya… I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

Chapter 11: CRISIS
[Empty Club. Kiryu sits at a table on the second floor and drinks from a glass. Joji is lying on the couch.]

Joji: How long was out for?

Kiryu: Oh, just an hour or so.

Joji: And the boy?

Kiryu: Taking the last flight back to Tokyo. He said he wants to apologize to Tamiya in person.

Joji: (sips a drink) Good.

Kiryu: He and Tamiya are pretty similar. Two men driven by emotion. I see now why Tamiya took a shine to him.

[Joji smiles.]

Kiryu: Are you sure you can just let Toma go like this?

Joji Kazama: What do you mean? You're the one who asked me to do it.

Kiryu: Well, from the way Tamiya put it, it sounded like CIA orders were absolute for you. Is me beating you in a fight really all it takes for you to abandon that resolve?

Joji Kazama: Hmph. I see what you're getting at. I can't deny the importance of the CIA in my life, but I work by my own methods. All they care about is achieving the proper result.

Kiryu: Meaning Daigo and Nakahara were shot in order to achieve that "result"?

Joji Kazama: Well…

Kiryu: I still don't believe you'd do that, even if you'd been ordered to.

Joji Kazama: ……

Kiryu: So tell me the truth, Joji. Was it really you who shot them?

Joji Kazama: …I suppose I do owe you an explanation.

Kiryu: I'm all ears.

Joji Kazama: The truth of it is, what happened to Shigeru Nakahara and Daigo Dojima was an unfortunate side effect of our concerted efforts to pass the military expansion bill. But there would have been no need to shoot them under normal circumstances.

Kiryu: What!?

Joji Kazama: The one responsible for that was a colleague of mine.

Kiryu: Another CIA agent?

Joji Kazama: Yes. In Nakahara's case, we were trying to obtain the deed to his land. But what happened to Daigo Dojima was all an unfortunate misunderstanding.

Kiryu: What do you mean, a misunderstanding?

Joji Kazama: Daigo panicked when he saw me put my hand in my pocket. Yakuza instinct, I suppose. He must have thought I was going for my gun, then before I knew it he had his own weapon trained on me.

Kiryu: So your friend shot him.

Joji Kazama: Correct. It wasn't dissimilar to how things went down with Nakahara. The first thing he did when we barged in demanding the deed was go for his gun.

Kiryu: And this other agent… Is he one of the foreigners I ran into in Kamurocho?

Joji Kazama: Yes. I must make it clear, we try our best to avoid taking lives in our line of work, even when the mission is at risk. But under those circumstances, we simply had no choice.

Kiryu: No choice, huh…?

Joji Kazama: Even still, I would be lying if I said I didn't feel pangs of guilt over what happened.

Kiryu: Don't. You're not the one who shot them.

Joji Kazama: True, but the only reason we've arrived at this point is the agenda put forth by the CIA. The least I can do now is offer an apology. If possible, I'd like to do the same to both of the men impacted by all this.

Kiryu: You can apologize to Nakahara right now. He's already out of the hospital.

Joji Kazama: I'm glad to hear that, but I don't have the authority to talk to a civilian about these matters. Everything we're doing here is highly confidential, after all.

Kiryu: That explains why you can't tell him anything, but the CIA won't even let you meet with him? That seems… strict.

Joji Kazama: Strict as it may be, that's the way it is. I've killed far more than my fair share of men in this line of duty. But atoning for those lives that I've taken… is impossible. Going against a direct CIA mandate. That impossibility is the most difficult part of this job.

Kiryu: I'll tell Nakahara myself, then. That wouldn't be a problem, would it?

Joji Kazama: No, please do. And please apologize to Daigo as well once you're back in Tokyo.

Kiryu: Daigo? Do you know where he is?

Joji Kazama: You don't?

Kiryu: No. Kashiwagi-san told me he couldn't risk letting that information out in case it fell into the wrong hands.

Joji Kazama: So then nobody else knows where he is?

Kiryu: As far as I know.

Joji Kazama: I need more certainty than that, Kiryu.

Kiryu: All I know is what Kashiwagi-san told me. What difference would it make, anyway?

Joji Kazama: Let me ask you something. What do you think Mine would do if he found out Daigo was still alive?

Kiryu: Mine? What does he have to do with this?

Joji Kazama: Daigo is nothing more than an obstacle on his path toward Tojo Clan chairmanship, yes? He wouldn't just stand by and watch if he knew Daigo hadn't been killed.

Kiryu: Are you saying Mine knows where Daigo is?

Joji Kazama: It's difficult to know either way. But I can't rule out the possibility. And if Mine is working with Black Monday, he'll have total access to their information network. In other words… As long as there's a chance Mine knows where he is, Daigo is in grave danger.

Kiryu: So. Where's Daigo?

Joji: In Tokyo. Rehabbing at Touto Hospital.

Kiryu: Touto? But that's practically on Kamurocho's doorstep.

Joji: Yes. CIA headquarters has only known for a few hours now. And I just found out myself. If Mine has managed to find out as well, we may already be too late.

[Kiryu stands up and grabs his jacket.]

Joji: I assume you're going?

Kiryu: Yeah. If I hurry, I should be able to catch the last flight.

[Suddenly he hears a familiar voice…]

Taichi: Uncle Kaz! Uncle Kiryu! Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Taichi! What are you doing here!?

Taichi: This is bad! This is real bad, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: What is it? What happened!?

Taichi: It's Morning Glory! They…!

[We are jumping back in time to Okinawa. Rikiya, Mikio, and the kids are playing volleyball in the yard. Nakahara, Saki, and Haruka are watching them sitting on the porch. Suddenly Tamashiro enters the grounds with two dozen of his thugs, armed with bats, hammers and other weapons.]

Rikiya: The hell? Get outta here! The Tamashiro got nothin' to do with this place!

[With a nasty smirk on his face, Tamashiro shoots Mikio and Rikiya in the knees.]

Nakahara: Rikiya! Mikio!

[Suddenly… Mine emerges from the thugs. He goes to the children. Haruka covers them with herself.]

Mine: You like it here, huh? Funny. Seeing you kids leeching off an adult's generosity… It makes me sick to my stomach. You're stray pups, sure. But that alone doesn't mean you deserve protection. I'd rather see you all put down. Well, I suppose all of this is that hypocrite Kiryu-san's fault. In a way… You're all his victims.

[Haruka slaps him. Mine smiles and slaps her back. Harula falls on the sand. The children surround her.]

Mine: Smash it.

[One of the scumbags hears Mame barking and decides to destroy the dog kennel first. Izumi covers the kennel with her body.]

Izumi: No!

Thug: (pushes her aside) Outta the way!

Izumi: (grans his leg) No! Don't do it!

Rikiya: Izumi!

Mikio: (crawling to Izumi) Stop!

Izumi: Please!

Thug: (swings his hammer) Shut it, you fuckin' brat!

Izumi: Please! Stop!

[Mimio covers the kennel with his body. The blow of the hammer went straight to Mikio’s spine.]

Izumi: Uncle Mikio!

Rikiya: Mikio!

Thug: The hell're you doin', man?

Mikio: I'm not… Letting you do this.

Nakahara: Mikio!

Tamashiro: What're you waiting for, coward!? Just crush 'em both!

Thug: Yes, sir!

Rikiya: Mikio! That's enough!

[The thug strikes again in the area of Mikio’s cervical spine. Apparently his head hits the roof of the dog kennel, and Mikio's forehead begins to bleed.]

Mikio: Dammit…

[He falls off the roof onto the ground.]

Izumi: Uncle Mikio!

Mikio: (out of his last breath) Sorry… I wasn't stronger…

Izumi: Uncle Mikio! Uncle Mikio!

[The thug smashes the kennel to pieces,]

Rikiya: (punches the sand) No!

Nakahara: (trying to stand up) Mikio!

Tamashiro: Not so fast. We got some unfinished business.

Nakahara: Tamashiro!

Tamashiro: Could've sworn you croaked, old man. Guess you're tougher than you look.

Nakahara: Tamashiro… If it's me you're after… Just end it already. But the kids have nothing to do with this! Spare them! Spare this orphanage, please! (falls to his knees) I'm beggin' you!

Tamashiro: Oh, but that's not good enough. (puts his boot on Nakahara’s head) I still haven't forgotten what you did to me last year. You old fuck!

[Two of the Tamashiro thugs grab Nakahara.]

Rikiya: Boss!

Tamashiro: We're gonna have a nice long talk later, you and me. After we tear this place to the ground, that is.

Nakahara: What!?

Tamashiro: C'mon. Bring it in!

[A bulldozer drives into the orphanage, breaking a stone wall.]

Nakahara: Stop!

[Tamashiro laughs. Meanwhile in Tokyo Kiryu clenches his fists in fury.]

Taichi: Things are real bad! You gotta go back right now, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: All right. (to Joji) I'm going back to Morning Glory. I need to take care of my kids, Joji. That's the first priority.

Joji Kazama: …Right. At the very least, I may have a way to get you to Tokyo quicker once you're done.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Joji Kazama: I'll reach out to CIA headquarters, see if I can arrange something over at one of the military bases. I'll need to head up to Tokyo myself soon enough, after all. Oh, and there's no question that Mine is working with Black Monday. Meaning he'll more likely than not be waiting for you at the hospital. I imagine Richardson will be there, too.

Kiryu: That's the leader of Black Monday, right? I remember Tamiya telling me about him.

Joji Kazama: Yes. Unfortunately even with the CIA's massive information network, all we have is his name. The man is an enigma. One thing is for sure, though. He's responsible for every last operation Black Monday has ever put into motion. If Tamiya told you about Richardson, I assume you were also told about our plan to lure him out. Assuming it's worked, I'll need to go to Tokyo to finally arrest him. In other words, leave the transportation to me. You get home to your kids.

Kiryu: Thanks, Joji. I appreciate it. Let's go, Taichi.

Taichi: We gotta hurry!

[Kiryu runs to the Sirots' shelter. It turns out to be badly destroyed. The supports of the house in the center are broken and the roof is just lying on a pile of wood. Izumi, Rikiya and Haruka sit near Mikio’s body. His head are wrapped in a bandage. The spirit of the children is crushed. Kiryu and Taichi enter.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz.

Children: Uncle Kaz!

Ayako: It was so scary! (cries)

Kiryu: Give me a minute here. 

Rikiya: Aniki…

Kiryu: How's Mikio? (to Mikio) Mikio. Mikio!

[Mikio opens his eyes slowly.]

Rikiya: Mikio…

Mikio: It was all me. I couldn't stop 'em…

Kiryu: It's not your fault. Not at all! Don't talk like that.

Mikio: Sir…

Kiryu: What is it?

Mikio: Please… Save the boss for me.

Kiryu: I will. I'll bring Nakahara back. I promise!

Mikio: (faintly) Glad to… hear it. (passes out)

Rikiya: Mikio? Mikio? Answer me, Mikio!

[He pushes Mikio but he doesn't move.]

Kiryu: Dammit…!

Izumi: No! Uncle Mikio!

Rikiya: (screams) Mikio!

[There’s an ambulance sound in the background. Some time passes. The children are sleeping on a wide blue plastic sheet. Rikiya talking on the phone.]

Rikiya: Hello? You mean it!? Yeah, uh-huh. Right. I see! Thanks a bunch!  Later. (to the others) It's Mikio. He's gonna pull through.

Kiryu: That's incredible.

Taichi: What a relief!

[Kiryu looks at Haruka. She nods.]

Kiryu: Well. It's about time I get going.

Rikiya: To bring the boss home?

Kiryu: Yeah. They'll be at the bullring right outside downtown Ryukyu, right?

Rikiya: Yup. Tamashiro's been usin’ it as a hideout for a year or so now.

Kiryu: Got it.

Rikiya: Aniki. I'm coming with. Please.

Kiryu: No. You've been shot. You need to see a doctor.

Rikiya: But Aniki!

Kiryu: (persistently) I said no! If you come with me now, you'll die a pointless death.

Rikiya: Aniki…

Kiryu: This isn't like when you followed me to Kamurocho. This time, I have to go alone.

Rikiya: (emotionally) But I'm the captain of the Ryudo Family! My patriarch's been taken, my pride broken… And you want me to just do nothing!? Please. I need this. I need to prove to myself I'm a real man!

Kiryu: I get what you're going through, but… Now's not the time for that. Throwing your life away for no reason won't make you a man. Just wait, Rikiya. Your time will come, I promise. And when it does, you can go out guns blazing. For now… just trust me.

[Rikiya starts crying and Kiryu leaves.]

Kiryu: (The Tamashiro are keeping Nakahara at the bullring on the outskirts of town. I should stock up on whatever I need in town, then take a taxi over to the bullring.)

[He catches a cab and goes to the bullring. There’s four angry bulls in the ring… Tamashiro sits on the other side of the entrance.]

Tamashiro: (laughs) You again? Just the guy I wanted to see!

Kiryu: Where's Nakahara!?

Tamashiro: Easy, boy. Don't get antsy. Lemme enjoy this reunion a bit first. You know, when Mine told me we'd be meeting again… I got goosebumps from head to toe.

Kiryu: And Mine? Where is he?

Tamashiro: Long gone by now. To Tokyo. My only job was wrecking that shithole of an orphanage you run. Oh, and keeping you pinned down here. If you die here, the Hakuho'll make me a billionaire. And if I wipe out the Ryudo too, Okinawa'll be mine and mine alone.

Kiryu: Bastard…

Tamashiro: Now, we got all the time in the world. Let's have a little fun, huh?

[Two thugs bring Nakahara to the ring.]

Kiryu: Nakahara!

Nakahara: Kiryu!

Tamashiro: (laughs) Pretty picture, ain't it? An old bullshitter taking on some old bulls! The irony's killing me.

Kiryu: Tamashiro! (runs to him)

Tamashiro: Not so fast! You might not know, but bulls are real sensitive to the sound of gunfire. One little "pop" from this thing, and they'll tear your buddy, Nakahara, to bits. So whaddya say? Let's just forget about Nakahara for now. He'll have plenty of playtime with his new pals once you're out of the picture.

[A bunch of Tamashiro’s thugs run in. Suddenly we hear a voice…]

Voice: Not happenin’!

Tamashiro: Who's there?

[Rikia, waddling, enters. On top of that, he brought Saki along for some reason.]

Rikiya: Sorry ‘bout this, Aniki! Don't get mad! The little lady… I caught her sneakin' here all on her own!

Kiryu: Rikiya!

Nakahara: Saki…

Tamashiro: The hell you want, another bullet in the leg!?

Rikiya: Tamashiro! The cops are on their way! In ten minutes they'll have every last corner of this place covered!

Tamashiro: What!?

Rikiya: A two-bit thug like you… You'll never compete with Nakahara or Kiryu-aniki!

Tamashiro: You little shit. I get it now. You must reeeally wanna watch your beloved patriarch bite the dust.   Fine. If you want it that bad… I'd be glad to oblige!

[He shot several times in the air. The bulls become enraged and circle around Nakahara.]

Tamashiro: Nakahara! It's the end of the line for you and your chickenshit Ryudo boys!

Rikiya: Boss!

Kiryu: Nakahara!

[One of the bulls rushes to Nakahara.]

Saki: Dad!

Rikiya: Saki!

Saki: (screams) Dad, look out!

[Nakahara tensed up and grabbed the bull by the horns. As he travels a few meters along the ground, he stops it and, lifting it over his head, throws it to the ground. The average weight of an adult bull is 1,100 to 2,200 pounds (498 to 997 kg).]

Rikiya: Boss!

Kiryu: Nakahara!

Tamashiro: The fuck?

Nakahara: Tamashiro! I haven't felt this good in years! It's like I'm a kid again, rullin' this town! Kiryu! Kiryu… I'll be fine! Handle him for me, will ya?

Kiryu: Got it!

[He turns to Tamashiro’s thugs.]

Kiryu: Rikiya!

Rikiya: Yeah?

Kiryu: How long until the cops show up?

Rikiya: Seven or eight minutes!

Kiryu: Great. That should be just enough time to take out the trash here.

Rikiya: Right!

Kiryu: But only just. There's no time to waste. We'll need to make this quick.

Tamashiro: (laughs) Works for me. Go on, men! Fuck 'em up!

[Kiryu destroys the thugs and Tetsu Tamashiro himself. He falls on the sand of the arena. Rikiya and Saki enter.]

Nakahara: Glad I'm not the only gassed one here. Guess we're both over the hill.

Kiryu: Speak for yourself.

[Saki runs to Nakahara and hugs him.]

Nakahara: Saki. I'm… so proud of you.

[Tamashiro wakes up and reaches for the gun.]

Nakahara: And I'm sorry. For making you worry.

[Rikiya notices Tamashiro awake. Tamashiro shoots Kiryu, but… Rikiya covers him with her body. The bullet hits him right in the heart.]

Kiryu: Rikiya!

Tamashiro: (smirks) Turning your back on an enemy? Amateur move. And now… I'm finally gonna end you!

[But he got shot right in the head. It was Joji.]

Joji: Looks like I was too late.

[Rikiya gurgles with blood.]

Kiryu: Rikiya!

Rikiya: I think… he got me. Aniki… (faintly) How's it… look? 

Kiryu: You'll be fine! Just fine! It's just a scratch! Hey! Stay with me! Please!

Rikiya: (grabs Kiryu’s hand) Aniki… Does this count… as… Throwing my life away… for no reason? I… saved you. Didn’t I? Then… Maybe… That's all I need.

Kiryu: Rikiya, please.

Rikiya: Aniki. We had some good times. But I guess this is it.

Kiryu: Don't talk like that!

Rikiya: Looks like… I'm… A real man… now, huh?

[He coughs up blood.]

Kiryu: Rikiya!

Rikiya: Ani… ki… You’re… A great man. The best I've ever known.

Kiryu: Rikiya.

Rikiya: Just… promise me… Mine. You…

Kiryu: (cries) Mine? What about him!?

Rikiya: Don't let him win.

Kiryu: (clenches Rikiya’s hand) I won't! Just don't go! Please, Rikiya!

Rikiya: I'm… sorry… Ani… ki…

[Rikiya dies. His hand falls out of Kiryu’s.]

Kiryu: (hysterically) Rikiya! Please! Rikiya! Come on! You can't die on me, Rikiya! I… I won't let you! (madly) You hear me, Rikiya!? Just get up, Rikiya! Rikiya!

[Joji puts his hand on Kiryu’s shoulder.]

Chapter 12: END OF AMBITION
MEANWHILE, ABOVE TOKYO

[Mine is sleeping quietly on the side of his own plane. A little farther away from him sit two of his closest associates and talk after dinner.]

Stewardess: (via radio) We will be arriving in approximately 10 minutes. Please remain seated with your seatbelt fastened until we have safely landed.

Thug in White Suit: Man. I'd give anything to see the look on Kiryu's face right about now.

Thug in Black Suit: Bet he realizes he should never have messed with the Hakuho.

Thug in White Suit: We've waited so long… but it's finally Chairman Mine's time to shine.

Thug in Black Suit: I think we've earned ourselves a little party once we're back in Tokyo.

Thug in White Suit: What for?

Thug in Black Suit: Mine's a lock for the seventh chairmanship at this point. Not only is our Kiryu problem snuffed out for good, but we're gonna be top of the pack.

Thug in White Suit: Guess you're right. The boss'll be happy, too.

Thug in Black Suit: But you know, the sixth chairman let his guard down way too easy. (smirks) No wonder he got a bullet in his chest.

Thug in White Suit: Got that right. Kid like him had no business leading the clan in the first place. Not too long since he was in diapers, you know. But I guess he's good as dead now.

Thug in Black Suit: Hell yeah he is.

[Mine approaches them.]

Mine: What was that?

Thug in White Suit: Oh, Chairman. He was just suggesting we throw ourselves a party.

Mine: Why, did something good happen?

Thug in White Suit: Oh yeah, it's—

[Mine swiftly grabs a table knife and sticks it to the thugs' left hand.]

Mine: (angerly) What happened, huh!? You think the sixth chairman's death is something to celebrate!? Is it!?

[He drops the knife and quitle sits in his chair.]

MEANWHILE, AT THE OKINAWA AIRFIELD…

[Joji, Kiryu and Haruka wait for the CIA plane.]

Kiryu: I get it now. This is how you got between Okinawa and Tokyo so fast.

Joji: Bingo. The entire trip clocks in just under an hour.

[He signals to the pilot.]

Joji: You sure you're ready to go?

Kiryu: Yeah. I made Rikiya a promise. I’m going to end things with Mine. (stretches out his hand) Thanks for everything.

Joji: What are you doing? This isn't over yet. Once you stop Mine, and once I capture Richardson… Then, and only then, I'll shake your hand. Now go. It's just the two of you?

Kiryu: Yeah. You're coming, right, Haruka?

Haruka: Mhm!

Joji: I won't be far behind. After you find Daigo, head up to the hospital roof. I'll send a rescue helicopter your way.

Kiryu: Got it.

Joji: And be careful, you hear?

Kiryu: I'll see you on the roof.

[Meanwhile at Daigo’s hospital room… Mine sits next to him.]

Mine: Sixth Chairman.

[Mine’s thug enters. He got a phone in his hands.]

Thug: Sir. It's Mr. Richardson.

Mine: (in ENGLISH, but with a heavy accent) Hello? Okay, got it. No. There's no change in the plan. Bye. (to the thug in Japanese) Kiryu-san has left Okinawa. He'll be joining us here soon enough.

Thug: How should we respond?

Mine: We shouldn't. Once “they” arrive… it'll all be over.

[Kiryu returns to Kamurocho.]

Haruka: Hey, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: What's up?

Haruka: You're here to save Daigo-san, aren't you? Why'd you ask me to come with you? You usually make me stay home, even when I beg to go. Uncle Kaz. Are you gonna die up here!? Is that why you brought me with you? Because you know this is the end!?

[She grabs Kiryu’s legs.]

Kiryu: I'm sorry, Haruka.

Haruka: Huh?

Kiryu: I just wanted to see Kamurocho with you one last time.

Haruka: Uncle Kaz…

Kiryu: I'm sorry. It was selfish of me to bring you. I should have just left you—

Haruka: (hugs Kiryu) It's okay. I'm happy I'm here.

Kiryu: Haruka.

Haruka: I really am. Thank you, Uncle Kaz.

[Kiryu hugs Haruka back.]

Kiryu: (It's nice, just me and Haruka back in Kamurocho. I should think about heading to Serena and filling Date-san in on everything that's happened.)

[He walks towards New Serena but a foreingh man in black suit and aviator glasses stops him.]

Foreign Man: Excuse me, Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: Who's asking?

Foreign Man: The name's Rick Langley, sir, with the CIA. I'm here with a message for you from Joji Kazama.

Kiryu: A message, huh?

Rick Langley: That's right, sir. He said if you want to go back to Okinawa, you'll need to first take a taxi to Yokoda Airfield, then hop on a jet down. Joji is on his way here as we speak. He will be seeing you soon enough, I imagine.

Kiryu: Right. Tell him I said thanks.

Rick Langley: Of course. Goodbye, sir.

[Kiryu enters the New Serena.]

Date: Kiryu… You're back.

Kiryu: For now, yeah.

Date: And I see you brought a little someone with you. Guess that means everything's settled, huh?

Kiryu: We won't have to worry about Joji Kazama or having our land taken away from us anymore.

Date: And the Hakuho Clan?

Kiryu: That's actually why I'm here. I have reason to believe Mine is on his way to the hospital where Daigo's staying, and I need to stop him before it's too late.

Date: Any way I can help?

Kiryu: …Yeah. Look after Haruka while I'm gone.

Date: What, that's it? You're… not thinking of heading in there all on your own, are you?

Kiryu: I am.

Date: Now hold on a second! You can't just… Ah, what am I thinking? No matter how hard I fight, you're still gonna do it. All right. I'll keep Haruka safe and sound while you're gone.

Kiryu: I appreciate it, Date-san.

Date: But do me something before you go. Say goodbye to her, yeah?

Kiryu: Heh, I can do that.

Haruka: …Is it time, Uncle Kaz?

Stay with Haruka
Go to Touto Hospital ✓

Kiryu: Yeah. It's time I put an end to this.

Haruka: Just… come home safe. Okay, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: I will. I promise.

Haruka: Well, now you promised so you definitely have to!

Kiryu: Don't worry. Just wait here. I'll be back before you know it.

[He leaves the New Serena.]

Kiryu: (Time to head over to Touto Hospital and save Daigo. Guess I'll need to grab a taxi there.)

[At the taxi stop he got a call.]

Kiryu: Hello?

Man's Voice: Kazuma? It's me, Joji.

Kiryu: What's up, Joji?

Joji Kazama: I'm just about back in Tokyo. Where are you now?

Kiryu: Getting in a cab. I'm going to the hospital to finally put an end to this madness.

Joji Kazama: Good. But listen, Kazuma. There's something I need to tell you before you go.

Kiryu: What’s that?

Joji Kazama: I just had headquarters issue an order to all active agents in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The CIA will have your back every step of the way.

Kiryu: Huh. Guess that explains why an agent walked up to me not too long ago.

Joji Kazama: There's one team we haven't been able to get in touch with, though. Remember, the CIA's goal here is apprehending Richardson. I'm not sure why we can't reach that team… But if you run into them, it's likely they'll see you as a mere obstacle in their path.

Kiryu: Hm. 
Joji Kazama: Worst comes to worst, you may even have to fight them. Just… watch your back, Kazuma.

Kiryu: Thanks, Joji. I will. (Guess I'll need to watch out for more than just Mine's men…)

Taxi Driver: Sir? Excuse me, sir? Are you getting in or not?

Kiryu: Huh? Oh, yeah. Sorry.

Taxi Driver: The minimum fare is 710 yen. Where would you like to go? Very well, sir. Touto Hospital it is.

[Kiryu enters the hospital building at night. Above the entrance is a sign 東都大学医学部附属病院 (Tokyo Metropolitan University Medical School Affiliated Hospital). The building seems empty and spooky. When a large group of Hakuho thugs in various levels show themselves.]

Kiryu: So you're the Hakuho, huh? I'm in a hurry here. Out of the way. Fine then. If it's a fight you want, that's what you'll get!

Kiryu: (Maybe I can beat some info about Daigo out of these guys…)

[He crashes three dozens of thugs on the ground floor and goes up. Soon he encounters Hakuho Captain and beats him up.]

Hakuho Captain: You just fought… through a whole fuckin' army…

Kiryu: Where's Daigo? Talk! Or do you need a little more convincing?

Hakuho Captain: I'll talk, I'll talk… He's up on the 25th floor of the other building, room 2501. Chairman Mine should be up there with him.

Kiryu: (The 25th floor!? I need to get moving!)

Go to Daigo’s Hospital Room
[Kiryu goes up floor by floor methodically killing Hakuho Thugs with guns he found. He uses an elevator and finally finds room 2501…. But there’s only a man in black coat there, Joji’s partner.]

Kiryu: It's you.

[He recalls they already had a fight.]

Kiryu: What are you doing here?

Man in Black Coat: (in ENGLISH) Looks like you're a little late. You just missed him. (takes his glasses off) If I'd known it would have come to this… I'd have killed you when first we met.

Kiryu: (in Japanese) What? Where's Daigo? What did you do with him!?

Man in Black Coat: (in ENGLISH) If you're looking for Daigo, Mine's taken him up to the roof.

Kiryu: (in Japanese) The roof, huh? And let me guess. If I want to get up there, I'll need to go through you.

Man in Black Coat: (in ENGLISH) You're welcome to try. This is the end of the line for you, Kazuma Kiryu!

[They had a Metal Gear style fight. Kiryu wipes the floor of the guy without much effort.]

Kiryu: (Mine and Daigo are on the roof… I've gotta hurry.)

[But the CIA operative isn’t finished yet! He clenches his hand.]

Go To The Roof
[Several CIA agents, armed with assault rifles and wearing tactical armor, stand in Kiryu's way. After a while, a man in a black coat with two handguns joins the fight. Kiryu defeats them all and goes to the roof. There we see Mine and Daigo on a gurney. Mine smokes and looks at the city. Kiryu rushes in.]

Kiryu: Mine!

Mine: So you've come. I knew you would. I'm glad to see you, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: Spare me the small talk! Mine. What are you going to do with Daigo!? You want to kill him, don't you? So you can take control of the Tojo Clan.

Mine: An interesting theory. But I couldn't care less about that. This isn't how it was meant to be.

Kiryu: What do you mean? Explain yourself!

Mine: Kiryu-san. The truth is, Daigo-san— The sixth chairman, I mean. I've been very worried about him.

Kiryu: What!?

Mine: My entire life, nobody believed in me. Not until the sixth chairman came along, that is. (drops the cigarette) Kiryu-san. You're aware that Kanda is the one who brought me into the yakuza world, yes?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Mine: Well, what if I told you I bribed him to let me in? I needed a fool recently out of prison, and Kanda fit the bill. Almost to a T.

Kiryu: Why stoop that low just to join the yakuza?

Mine: You see, just like you… I, too, was an orphan.

Kiryu: What!?

Mine: Alone in this world from the moment I was born. The only childhood memories I have… are ones of struggle for survival. I was like one of those children scavenging the ruins of post-war Tokyo. It's hard to believe such poverty still exists nowadays. You know what I went through. Loved by no one. Needed by no one. No companion but your own loneliness. I needed to make something of myself. Becoming successful. Making money. That was all I cared about. I worked myself to the bone. I made countless sacrifices. And do you know why? It was all about money. From the minute I made wealth my goal, every moment…. every breath I took was taken toward achieving that goal. Until at last, I could buy anything I wanted. Have any woman I wanted. My employees would gladly follow any order | gave them. But I came to a realization. All of that… was a lie.

Kiryu: What do you mean?

Mine: Don't you see? Humans by nature are selfish liars. No matter how many claim loyalty to the cause, they'll all abandon ship sooner or later. Living through that reality made me wonder. Does friendship truly exist? Is loyalty just an unreachable ideal? It was then that I learned of a system in which the bonds between men ruled supreme. 

Kiryu: In other words… the yakuza.

Mine: Correct. So I decided, I needed to see for myself if these bonds really existed. Bribing Kanda was simple. Just like that, I was in the Tojo Clan. That's where I met… Daigo-san here. Daigo-san, despite my lack of yakuza experience… despite my lack of human experience… He welcomed me with open arms. He wasn't much older than me. But he had the charisma of a true leader. It was incredible to see. He was the first person I had ever admired with every fiber of my being.

Kiryu: Then why? Why are you doing this?

Mine: The truth is, Kiryu-san. If Daigo-san were still alive right now, I never would have gotten involved.

Kiryu: What? Explain.

Mine: Daigo-san is as good as dead. I was devastated. Robbed of the one man I ever loved, I needed to find a new reason to live. And this is what I settled on. Meaningless as it may be, I craved the power to do what I wanted. 

Kiryu: So you started working with Black Monday.

Mine: Correct.

Kiryu: I don't understand. Daigo's right there, still breathing!

Mine: He's nothing more than a tangle of tubes now. That's not a life worth living.

[He aims a gun at Daigo.]

Kiryu: Don't do it, Mine!

Mine: This isn't Daigo-san I once knew. That man has been long dead. I can't bear to see him like this anymore.

Kiryu: Mine. Listen. You have it all wrong. As long as a person is clinging to life, there's value in their existence. Don't you get it? Daigo is fighting tooth and nail just to hold on… And you're just going to senselessly kill him anyway?

Mine: (laughs) I knew you'd say something like that.

Kiryu: What?

Mine: I suppose that's one of the reasons Daigo-san liked you. (aims his gun at Kiryu) But me? People like you who stop at nothing to help others make my fucking blood boil!

[He shoots and misses just an inch from Kiryu's head. Kiryu himself didn't even flinch.]

Mine: (angerly) Why do you do it!? You were an orphan, just like I was! How can you keep playing these games!?

[He shot some more times with the same result.]

Mine: There are two things left for me to do. The first is finally ending Daigo-san's pathetic wreck of an existence. The second is murdering you. The man he respected so much. Then, once the Tojo is finally mine… my life will have meaning—

Kiryu: You're wrong. That won't give you meaning.

Mine: What!?

Kiryu: You don't understand a damn thing. I think I see why everyone deserted you. It's plain as day.

Mine: Don't act like you know me!

Kiryu: What about the people who left? Do you still resent them?

Mine: (emotionally) Of course I do! Money's all those heartless bastards live for! All they crave! I'd slit their throats if they were here now! Have a problem with that!?

Kiryu: (calmly) You're just like them. You and them… You both let money control your lives. Never stopped to face those around you. All you've ever cared about is you. You refused to trust a single soul but yourself. That's why you've always been alone.

Mine: Shut your mouth!

Kiryu: Even so, Daigo always viewed you as his equal. But when you finally started trusting him.

Mine: (shots) Not another word!

[Kiryu silently removes his shirt and jacket exposing the dragon tattoo.]

Mine: What do you think you're doing!?

Kiryu: I can stand here talking all night. But nothing I say will ever get through. So I'll just have to teach you what I mean… The only way I know how.

Mine: (laughs madly) Even when your whole world's at stake, you still refuse to change your ways. (drops the gun) Fine then. If you really think you can change my mind, after all I've said… you're welcome to try. 

[He also removes his shirt and jacket revealing he has a dragon tattoo too.]

Mine: But fair warning. I won't go down easy. Not even to a legend like you. Kiryu-san. This is your last battle. Make the most of it.

Kiryu: Don't worry. I will. Let's do this!

Mine: Here I go! Kiryu!

[They had a fateful fight till the last man standing. Mine falls to the floor.]

Mine: (panting) Looks like… I… Lost.

[His phone’s ringing.]

Secretary Katase: This is Katase.

Mine: Uh-huh.

Secretary Katase: Sir? Are you hurt?

Mine: I'm fine.

Secretary Katase: Chairman, I've been so worried about—

Mine: You know… Katase. You're the only one… 

Secretary Katase: I need your advice, sir. Please. We've received an offer on the Dubai stock deal. 10 times the original market value. Our European creditors have requested a meeting with you after hearing the news, and…

[Mine just takes the phone away from his ear. The secretary keeps talking.]

Mine: Money, huh? No surprise there. It's the only thing I have left. All this time, I've been vain. Never relied on anyone. Never trusted anyone. Only the power of money.

Secretary Katase: Chairman, this deal could bring you billions! Please, you need to make a decision.

Mine: But I suppose… people yearn to trust others. And to be trusted in return. Maybe that's all anyone really needs. Hey, Kiryu.

Secretary Katase: Chairman! If we don't respond soon, who knows how they may respond! Please, sir! Answer me! Chairma—

[Mine hangs up.]

Mine: Why is it… Is this how it feels… When your world comes crashing down?

Kiryu: Mine. As long as you live, you can always rebuild. It's never too late to change.

[Mine tries to stand up. Kiryu gives him a hand. A group of men in black enters.]

Mine: So they've come.

Kiryu: What the… What are the CIA doing here?

Mine: They're not CIA. It's merely a cover. They're all Black Monday leadership.

Kiryu: Then, that man is…

Mine: Yes. Andre Richardson.

Kiryu: So it’s him.

Mine: That's right. He's the one who told me you were on your way here. They knew everything the CIA and that fool Kazama were trying to do.

Andre Richardson: (in ENGLISH aiming his gun) I'm afraid your role in all of this has come to an end.

Kiryu: Dammit. What are they gonna do?

Mine: Kill us and search for someone else who can get the military expansion bill passed. In other words… I've outlived my usefulness to them.

Andre Richardson: (in ENGLISH) Oh, there are plenty of people who could replace you. And unfortunately… You both know far too much for me to let either of you live. Die.

[Daigo falls off the gurney.]

Andre Richardson: (in ENGLISH) What!?

[Daigo swiftly grabs Mine’s gun, shots two Black Monday agents and shots off the gun out of Richardson’s hand.]

Andre Richardson: (in ENGLISH) What the fuck!?

Daigo: I'm not… ready to die yet! You hear me!?

[He shoots Andre Richardson.]

Andre Richardson: (in ENGLISH) Dammit! (seemingly dies)

Kiryu: Daigo! Daigo.

Daigo: (barely speaking) Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: Are you hurt!?

Daigo: (barely speaking) I… could ask you the same thing. What… happened here?

[Mine falls to his knees.]

Daigo: Mine? Mine. What are you doing here? Are you hurt? That was a close one, huh? But… it's all okay now.

Mine: Chairman…

Andre Richardson: (maniacal laughs)

Daigo: Damn. He's tougher than I thought!

Andre Richardson: (in ENGLISH) I won't let it end like this. I'll kill you all!

[Kiryu covers Daigo with himself. Mine runs at Richardson despite being shot in the chest.]

Andre Richardson: (in ENGLISH) Die, god damn you! Die!

[Mine takes the gun away from Richardson and takes him in his grasp. He leads him to the edge of the roof.]

Andre Richardson: (in ENGLISH) Stop! Stop!

Mine: Chairman. I'm sorry.

Daigo: Mine! You don't need to do this! You hear me!? Get back here!

Mine: Sorry, but the truth of it is… I don't deserve to live.

Daigo: Mine!

Mine: Kiryu-san. I might be a sorry excuse for a yakuza… But I still know how to uphold my code of honor.

Kiryu: Mine!

Andre Richardson: (in ENGLISH) Stop it! Are you nuts!?

Mine: Kiryu-san. I wish we could have met sooner. I really do.

Kiryu: Mine…!

Mine: (smirks) Maybe in my next life… I'll have what it takes to earn your respect.

Kiryu: No! Don't do this, Mine!

Daigo: (screams) Mine!

[But Mine takes a plunge off the hospital roof along with Andre Richardson. A helicopter flies in. There’s Haruka, Date and Joji in it.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz!

Daigo: Kiryu-san. Tell me the truth. The traitor to the Tojo… Was it Mine?

Kiryu: No. Not a chance. He… would never have betrayed you.

[Some time passes… Kiryu talking with Kazuki and Yuya at the Theater Square in Kamurocho.]

Kazuki: Understood. I assume you'll be going tonight, then.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Yuya: City's gonna be lonely without you.

Kiryu: Don't worry, Yuya. We'll come visit every now and then. 

Kazuki: I look forward to it. Haruka-chan's here for you.

[Haruka waves to Kiryu.]

Kiryu: Guess that's my cue.

Kazuki: Farewell.

[Kazuki and Yuya bow and Kiryu leaves but a man approaches him.]

Man: Hold up, Kiryu.

Kiryu: Wait… Hamazaki?

Hamazaki: I got nothing left. And it's all 'cause of you. My life's in tatters. But I'd rather put a noose 'round my neck than rot behind bars.

Kiryu: How can you say that? Why not try to redeem yourself instead?

Hamazaki: What?

Kiryu: If you're really ready to die, you have nothing to lose by living. As long as you believe in something, and have the will to start fresh… I'd gladly lend you a hand.

Hamazaki: You expect me to believe that shit?

[Kiryu stretches out this hand to Hamazaki.]

Kiryu: I do.

Hamazaki: Fair enough. Maybe I could buy into it.

[He approaches Kiryu and sticks a knife in his stomach. Stunned by the betrayal, Kiryu looks at Hamazaki.]

Hamazaki: You really think I got nothing to lose, huh!? Believing in stuff!? Starting fresh!? (angerly) Don't patronize me with that shit! You're gonna see, asshole! Nothing matters anymore when you're six fucking feet under! Don't you get it!? Answer me, dipshit! Once you're dead and gone, nobody's gonna fucking care if you believed in them!

Kiryu: No… You're wrong.

Yuya: (screams) Hey! The hell’re you doing!?

[He and Kazuki run to Hamazaki and restrain him in their pathetic manner. Kiryu falls on the asphalt.]

Kazuki: Kiryu-san!

Haruka: Uncle Kaz! Uncle Kaz! Uncle Kaz! Hold on, Uncle Kaz! Please! Don't leave me, Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: You know… Mine taught me something. Even in your final moments… You can still learn to believe in someone!

[The game ends with a wide shot of clean sky. CREDITS. After it we return to Okinawa. Mame looks at his new kennel.]

Izumi: Look, Mame! We built you a new house! Why won't he go in, Uncle Mikio?

Mikio: Maybe he's nervous or somethin’?

[The children happily play volleyball.]

Mitsuo: Here it comes!

Koji: Can't touch me! Take this!

Eri: Hop and a skip!

Riona: Hop and a skip! Whoops, I messed up!

Ayako: Wow! You're so good at drawing, Saki-chan!

Saki: Oh, it's nothing.

Eri: Hey! Come look, Haruka-chan!

[Haruka just stands in the yard looking to the skies. Suddenly… Kiryu walks out of the house. His wound is healing. The camera flies back, showing us a wide view of the orphanage and fades to black.]
