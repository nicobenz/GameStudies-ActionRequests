An image of the old wizard Mordamir leaps from the candle and begin to speak:

“Dunric, you have come to save me. I am in the dungeons far below. I know I can count on you.”

This explains your old teacher’s mysterious disappearance, but there is one thing strange about the message… Your name is not Dunric.

[Our wizard go forth and see an orc and a man. They’re fighting.]

Orc: Don’t interfere!

[Wizard defeat the orc.]

Man: I see you have come. You must rescue Mordamir! He is captive many levels below. The entrance to the lower level is hidden. Here is a key you will need. I must go now.

[At a body...]

You find the body of a slain fighter. Search? You find a ring. A name is etched on the band: Dunric!

[At a chest...]

It’s locked but you have the key. Open it? You find 20 gold pieces. You find a bag of bait. You find a bag of smelling spores.

[Next room]

Orc: Don’t advance, stop!

Wizard: Surrender at once!

Orc: I warned you, old man!

[Wizard defeats the orc.]

The Wizard finds a note:
Danger of attack by Shades! They are invisible in dark rooms, but their shadows are visible by torchlight. Search? You find a door key.

[At a chest…]

It’s unlocked. You find 50 gold pieces. You find a bottle. You discover a scroll with a charm spell to use on will o’ the wisps.

[Next room]

You find a shiny, reflective amulet. There are runes on one side.

[Next room]

[Wizard uses the amulet on a ray of light.]

You could hold it up to the light here. Do it? There is an incantation on the back. Read it? [the answer is “no”]

[The wizard descends into the open passage to the catacombs.]

[Next room.]

Orc: Foolish old man!

[After defeating the orc the wizard finds a pile of straw and sleep on it.]

The straw is a small but welcome comfort in your first day’s travel. You drift into an uneasy slumber, wondering about Mordamir. Where is he now? Can you rescue him? You dream of dangers that lie ahead.

[Next room]

You find a red gem. Take it?

A pile of bones. Search it? You find an Elven sword of agility. Take it? The sword permanently endows you with Elven agility and quickness in combat. You notice something that looks wet and green under the pile. You could search further. Search? [the answer is “no”]

[Next room]

Merchant: Greetings, friend! Come, I’ve got something you need. These parts are plagued with slime. You can’t venture safely without my slime potion, a bargain at only 100 gold pieces. Do it? [the answer is “no”]

Merchant: All right, 80 gold pieces for my potion. Rub it on your boots and slime won’t touch you. 80, friend. Do it?

[The wizard uses The Charm spell.]

This charms the will o’ wisps to follow you. Read the spell again to turn them against your enemies.

You find a granite stone, slightly larger than the gem. Take it?

[Next room]

[The Wizard kill two orcs.]
