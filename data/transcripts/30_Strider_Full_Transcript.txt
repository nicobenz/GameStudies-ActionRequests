"THE STRIDERS"
Are the toughest group of people who execute acts such as infiltration, abduction explosion, instigation, etc.

BRIEFING
MATIC: Hiryu. There is only one reason I asked you to come for. Kain has captured by the enemy. Since they once knew who he is, rescuing him is meaningless. Kill him! That's your mission!

HIRYU: Kill Kain… I can't do it... The first thing is to find him.
