[The opening scene. The expensive limousine is slowly driving along the night street. The camera switches to the cabin of the limousine and we see a girl with blue hair and a bizarre-looking man with a long nose.]

Bizarre-looking man: Welcome to the Velvet Room.

[You find yourself in the cabin of the limousine.]

CHAPTER 1: Reach Out To The Truth
Bizarre-looking man: Ah… It seems we have a guest with an intriguing destiny… *chuckle*

Igor: My name is Igor… I am delighted to make your acquaintance. This place exists between dream and reality, mind and matter… It is a room that only those who are bound by a ”contract” may enter… It may be that such a fate awaits you in the near future. Now then… Why don’t you introduce yourself…?

[You write that you’re Yu.]

Igor: Hm… I see. Now let’s take a look into your future, shall we? Do you believe in fortune telling? Each reading is done with the same cards, yet the result is always different… *chuckle* Life itself follows the same principles, doesn’t it? Hm… The Tower in the upright position represents the intermediate future. It seems a terrible catastrophe is imminent. The card indicating the future beyond that is…

[Igor flips the cards.]

Igor: The Moon, in the upright position. This card represents ”hesitation” and ”mystery” … Very interesting indeed. It seems you will encounter a misfortune at your destination, and a great mystery will be imposed upon you. In the coming days, you will enter into a contract of some sort, after which you will return here. The coming year is a turning point in your destiny… If the mystery goes unsolved, your future may be forever lost. My duty is to provide assistance to our guests to ensure that does not happen. Ah! I have neglected to introduce my assistant to you. This is Margaret. She is a resident of this place, like myself.

Margaret: My name is Margaret. I am here to accompany you through your journey.

Igor: We shall attend to the details another time. Until then, farewell…

[The screen fades. A cheerful and carefree girl runs along the beach, washed by sea waves. She drinks a ice-cold soda.]

Girl: I’m tired of diets! Enough with going to the gym! Good thing there’s something even I can handle!

Announcer: Slim down this summer, with refreshing taste of Calorie Magic!

[It seems that this is street advertising. Then the news appears on the screen.]

News reporter: And… we’re back! Now onto some juicy news… the Mayumi Yamano scandal. I’m sure…

Man: Heh… At first he bags a singer, then he has an affair with a TV announcer on his side… Do chicks really dig politicians?

Woman: Isn’t it just stuff like money and connections? When you get down to it, financial and political influence is what matters.

Man: Hey! What’s that supposed to mean?

Woman: Oh, what do you think?

[Yu taking a train and recall past events.]

Teacher: Well, I’m sure that you all know already, but at the end of this month he will be transfering to another school.

[All students appears to be in shock.]

Students: No way! Seriously? Oh my gosh I can’t believe this!

Teacher: Quiet down guys! I’m not done yet.

[Yu looks at the message that came to his phone.]

”Meet us outside Yasoinaba Station at 4PM.”

Train Announcer: We will arrive at the Yasokami Terminal in a few minutes. Passengers headed for Inaba city and Yasoinaba Station, please go to the other side of the platform.

News Reporter: The scandal involves the star Misuzu Hiiragi preparing to her tour overseas. Taro Namatame, a counselor secretary in the Inaba region whom she married just last year, is now under suspicion of having an affair. What’s more, his rumored mistress is the well known TV announcer, Ms. Mayumi Yamano…

Girl: Oh… Should we go soon?

Man: Yeah, it’s just about…

News Reporter: …a question on everyone’s mind is how this love triangle will affect…

April 11th, 2011. Monday.
[Yu arrived at the station.]

Train announcer: Yasoinaba.

Man’s Voice: Hey! Over here!

Middle-aged man: Well, you’re more handsome in person than in your photo. Welcome to Inaba. I’m Ryotaro Dojima. I’ll be looking after you. Let’s see… I’m your mother’s younger brother… and that about sums it up.

”It’s nice to meet you.” ✔
”It’s been a long time.”
”……”

Ryotaro Dojima: Heh. You probably don’t remember, but we’ve met. I’ve changed your diapers before, you know. This here’s my daughter. Come on, Nanako, introduce yourself to your cousin.

Nanako Dojima: ……’lo.

Ryotaro Dojima: *chickle* What are you so shy for?

[She slaps his ass.]

Ryotaro Dojima: Ow, hahaha.

Nanako Dojima: ……

Ryotaro Dojima: Well then… Let’s get going. My car’s over there.

[Ryotaro leaves. Strange looking girl approaches that main character.]

Unfriendly-looking girl: … Hey. You dropped this.

”Thank you.” ✔
”It’s not mine.”

Unfriendly-looking girl: Whatever. All I did was pick it up.

> It’s the note you made for yourself with Dojima’s address…

Unfriendly-looking girl: ……

[Strange looking girl leaves. Ryotaro Dojima comes.]

Ryotaro Dojima: What’s wrong?

> You got in the car and headed for Dojima’s house.

> Inaba, Central shopping district, Gas station…

Attendant: Hi! Welcome to Moel!

Ryotaro Dojima: Can you go to the bathroom by yourself?

Nanako Dojima: Uh-huh.

Attendant: It’s in the back, to your left. You know which way’s left? The side you don’t hold your chopsticks in.

Nanako Dojima: I know… Geez.

Attendant: Are you taking a trip?

Ryotaro Dojima: No, we just went to pick him up. He just moved here from the big city.

Attendant: The city, huh…?

Ryotaro Dojima: Fill up my car while you’re at it. Regular’s fine.

Attendant: Right away, Sir!

Ryotaro Dojima: Good a time as any for a smoke…

[Ryotaro Dojima leaves.]

Attendant: (to Yu) Are you in high school? Does it surprise a city boy to see how little there is out here? There’s so little to do, I’m sure you’ll get bored fast, You’ll either be hanging out with your friends or doing part-time jobs. Speaking of which, we’re actually looking for part-time help right now. Give it some thought, why don’t you? We don’t mind if you’re a student. Oh, I should get back to work.

> Nanako is looking at you.

Nanako Dojima: … Are you okay? Did you get carsick? You don’t look too good…

> Could it be exhaustion from the long trip…? Now that she mentions it, you feel a little dizzy…

Ryotaro Dojima: What’s wrong? You okay?

”I’m just tired. ✔
”It’s nothing.”
”I just felt lightheaded.”

Ryotaro Dojima: That’s understandable. It must have been a long trip for you. Why not take a little walk, get some fresh air? Just let me know when you are ready to go. I’ll wait here. Why don’t you take a walk and get some fresh air? The shopping district is near the house, so you should get to know where all the stores are.

[We have a chance to stretch our legs and exploding the shopping district. Sooner or later we returns to Ryotaro Dojima.]

Ryotaro Dojima: How are you feeling? Ready to get back in the car?

”I’m ready.” ✔
”Not yet…”

Ryotaro Dojima: All right, let’s hit the road then.

> You arrive at Dojima’s residence. For the next year, this place will be your home…

Ryotaro Dojima: All right, let’s have a toast.

[They drink.]

Ryotaro Dojima: So… Your mom and dad are busy as always. They’re working overseas, was it? I know it’s only for a year, but getting stuck in a place like this because of your parents… It’s rough being a kid. Well, it’s just me and Nanako here, so it’ll be nice having someone like you around. So long as you are here, you are part of the family, so make yourself at home.

”I’ll do just that.”
”Thank you for your kindness.” ✔
”Yes, Sir!”
”……”

Ryotaro Dojima: C’mon, there’s no need to be so formal. Look, you’re making Nanako all tense. Well, anyway… Let’s eat.

[Dojima’s phone ringing.]

Ryotaro Dojima: Ugh… Who’s calling at this hour? …Dojima speaking. Yeah? I see… So where is it? All right, I’m on my way. Looks like I made the right choice to skip the booze… Sorry, but I gotta go take care of some business. Go ahead and eat without me. I don’t know how late I’ll be. Nanako, you help him out, okay?

Nanako Dojima: …Okay.

Ryotaro Dojima: Nanako, it’s raining out. What did you do with the laundry!?

Nanako Dojima: I already brought it in!

Ryotaro Dojima: … All right. Well, I’m off.

Weather Announcer: -- for this week. Next, let’s take a look at the hourly breakdown of tomorrow’s weather. With storm clouds moving in from the West, expect rain throughout all the day tomorrow in most areas.

Nanako Dojima: … Let’s eat.

> You find yourself alone with Nanako… You might want to strike up a conversation…

”What does your dad do?” ✔
”It must be tough.”
”……”

Nanako Dojima: He… investigating stuff. Like crime scenes. My dad’s a detective.

Announcer: And now for the local news. City council secretary Taro Namatame is under fire for an alleged relationship with a female reporter. His wife, enka ballad sensation, Misuzu Hiiragi, revealed to this station that she will likely pursue damages. In response, Eye Television has decided to cancel all of announcer Mayumi Yamano’s televised appearances. Until allegations of an affair with Mr. Namatame resolved she’ll remain of the air and out of the public eye.

Nanako Dojima: …This is boring.

Commercial: At Junes, everyday is a Customer Appreciation Day. Come see for yourself, and get in touch with products! Every day’s great at your Junes!

Nanako Dojima: Every day’s great at your Junes!

Nanako Dojima: …Aren’t you going to eat?

[You start eating. After dinner you go to your room.]

> This is the room you’re borrowing from Dojima… Go to sleep?

Yes ✔
No

> You’ll be living in this town for one year, starting today… You wonder if everything will be all right… School starts tomorrow. You should hurry to bed.

Yu: …!? This is…?

> The area is covered in a thick fog… All you can do right now is proceed forward…

???: Do you seek the truth…?

> You heard someone’s voice…

???: If it’s truth you desire, come and find me…

> You hear the voice from up ahead…

[You go further.]

> You sense someone ahead… Will you continue?

Yes ✔
No

[You open a massive door and enter foggy room with a person inside. We can’t see the person because of the fog.]

???: So… You are the one pursuing me… Hmhmhm… Try all you like…

[You attack the person.]

???: Hmm… It seems that you can see a little, despite the fog…

[You attack again.]

???: I see… Indeed… That is very interesting information…

[You attack the person one more time.]

???: But… You will not catch me so easily… If what you seek is ”truth,” then your search will be even harder…

???: Everyone sees what they want to… And the fog only deepens.

???: …Will we meet again…? At a place other than here… Hmmm… I look forward to it…

> You are losing consciousness…

> You can hear someone’s voice…

Nanako Dojima: Breakfast ready!

> It’s almost time to get up… You feel like you had a nightmare… What could it have been about…? You’re starting school today. You should head to the living room for now…

April 12th, 2011. Tuesday.
Nanako Dojima: Good morning. Okay. Let’s eat.

”Did your father go to work?” ✔
”Do you do the cooking?”

Nanako Dojima: There was some kind of trouble. He won’t be back. You’re starting school today, right? My school’s on the way, so… let’s go together.

> Nanako seems somewhat restless… You decided to head to school with Nanako.

> School Zone, Samegawa Flood Plain…

Nanako Dojima: You keep going straight from here. My school’s this way. Bye.

> School Zone, Intersection in front of the school…

Biking student: Whoaaaa… !

Pained student: Ngh… Urrrrghhhh…

> That looked painful… You should leave him be…

> You’ve arrived at the main gates of Yasogami High School. What kind of student life awaits you here…?

Sitting student: Talk about bad luck… The homeroom teacher here is Morooka, isn’t it?

Student’s friend: Yeah, it’s King Moron alright… We get to enjoy his long-ass sermons every day for a whole year…

Female student: Hey you guys, I heard there’s going to be a transfer student from the city in this city.

Sitting student: Huh? Really? A guy or a girl?

Short-haired girl: A transfer student from the city… Just like you, huh, Yosuke? …Huh? You look dead today.

Pained student: Yeah, um… I don’t wanna talk about it…

Short-haired girl: What’s with him?

Black-haired girl: Who knows?

Mr. Morooka: Awright, shut your traps! I’m Kinshiro Morooka, your homeroom teacher from today forward! First things first! Just ’cause it’s spring doesn’t mean you can swoon over each other like love struck baboons. Long as I’m around, you students are going to be pure as the driven snow! Now I hate wasting my time, but I’d better introduce this transfer student. This sad sack’s been thrown from the big city out to the middle of nowhere like yesterday’s garbage. And he’s just as much of a loser here as he was there, so you girls better not get any ideas about hitting on him! Tell ’em your name, kid, and it quick.

”Nice to meet you all.”
”……”
”…You calling me a loser”? ✔

> Your Courage has increased. 

Mr. Morooka: Hmh… That’s it, you’re on my shit list, effective intermediately. Now listen up! This town is miles away from your big city of perverts and assholes, in more ways than one. You better not even think of getting involved with the girls here, let alone abusing them! But what do I know… it’s not like the old days. Even here, kids grow up so damn fast. Every time I turn my back, you’re fooling around on those damn phones, checking your life-journals and your my-places…

> Mr. Morooka goes on and on…

Short-haired girl: Excuse me! Is it okay if the transfer student sits here?

Mr. Morooka: Huh? Yeah, sure. Ya hear that? Your seat’s over there. So hurry up and sit down already!

Short-haired girl: He’s the worst, huh? Rotten luck for you to get stuck in this class… Well, we just have to hang in there for a year.

> You can hear people around you talking about you…

Male student: Sucks to be the transfer student, ending up in King Moron’s class on the first morning here…

Whiny student: Yeah, he won’t think twice about suspending you if you get on his bad side. Then again, we’re all in the same boat…

Mr. Morooka: Shut your traps! I’m taking roll, and I damn well expect you to respond in an orderly manner!

> Your life at this new school has begun. Will you be able to fit in here…?

Mr. Morooka: That’s all for today. Normal lectures will start tomorrow.

School intercom: Attention, all teachers. Please report immediately to the Faculty Office for a brief staff meeting. All students must return to their classrooms and are not to leave the school until further notice.

Mr. Morooka: Hmh. You heard the announcement. Don’t go anywhere until you hear otherwise.

Brown-haired girl: He’s seriously getting on my nerves…

Excited student: Did something happen? Don’t those sirens sound really close? Ugh, I can’t see a damn thing. Frickin’ fog…

Rumor-loving student: Yeah, like every time it rain lately, it gets all foggy.

Knowledgeable student: Hey, did you hear? I hear that paparazzi’s looking all over for that announcer.

Rumor-loving student: Oh yeah. You mean Mayumi Yamano, right? I heard some guys spotted her at the shopping district.

Knowledgeable student: Actually, I heard that…

Rumor-loving student: Are you serious!?

Rumor-loving student: H-Hey, Yukiko-san. Mind if I ask you something…? Is it true that announcer’s staying at your family’s inn?

Black-haired girl: I can’t discuss such things.

Rumor-loving student: Y-Yeah, I guess not.

Short-haired girl: *sigh* Sheesh, how much longer is this gonna take?

Black-haired girl: There’s no telling.

Short-haired girl: I shoulda left before the announcement came on… By the way, didja try what I told you the other day? You know… That thing about rainy nights…

Black-haired girl: Oh… No, not yet. Sorry.

Short-haired girl: Ahhh, that’s okay. It’s just, I heard a guy in the class next door yell something like, ”My soulmate is Yamano, the announcer!”

School intercom: Attention, all students. There has been an incident in the the school district. Police officers have been dispatched around the School Zone. Please stay calm and contact your parents or guardians as soon as possible, and quickly leave the school grounds. Do not disturb the police officers. Head directly home. I repeat…

Excited student: ”Incident”!?

Girl’s friend: What, something actually happened?

Brown-haired girl: C’mon, let’s go take a look!

Short-haired girl: Hey, are you going home by yourself? Why don’t you come with us? Oh, nearly forgot! I’m Chie Satonaka. You know I sit next to you, right?

”Of course.” ✔
”You do?”

Chie Satonaka: Well, nice to meet you! This is Yukiko Amagi.

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, nice to meet you… I’m sorry that this is so sudden…

Chie Satonaka: C’mon, don’t apologize like that. It nukes me look like I got no upbringing. I just wanted to ask some stuff. Really, that’s all.

Bleak-looking student: Uh, um, Miss Satonaka…? This was really awesome. Like, the way they moved was just amazing to see… And… I’m really sorry! It was an accident! Please just have mercy until my next paycheck! See ya! Thanks!

Chie Satonaka: Stop right there! What did you do to my DVD!?

[She runs to him and strike his balls.]

Bleak-looking student: Argh!

Chie Satonaka: What the!? I can’t believe this! It’s completely cracked… My ”Trial of the Dragon… !

Bleak-looking student: I think mine’s cracked too… C-Critical hit to the nads…

Yukiko Amagi: A-Are you all right?

Bleak-looking student: Oh, Yukiko-san… Are you worried about me…?

Chie Satonaka: He’s fine, Yukiko. Let’s ditch him and go home.

Strange student: You’re Yuki, right? Y-You want to go hang out somewhere?

Yukiko Amagi: What…? Wh-Who are you?

Onlooking student: What’s up with him? What school’s he from?

Spectacled student: Never mind that, he’s going for Yukiko-san? Man, you’d think he’d at least wait until she’s alone to make his move…

Onlooking student: I bet you a can of TaP he gets knocked out.

Spectacled student: No bet. Haven’t you heard how difficult the Amagi Challenge is?

Strange student: Um, s-so… are you coming or not?

Yukiko Amagi: I-I’m not going…

Strange student: …Fine!

Yukiko Amagi: Wh-What did he want from me…?

Chie Satonaka: What did he want…? Obviously, he was asking you out on a date.

Yukiko Amagi: Huh? Really…?

Chie Satonaka: You really had no clue? Sheesh… But then again, that was way over the top. It was creepy how he called you Yuki all of a sudden.

Cycling student: Yo, Yukiko-san. Turned down another lovelorn fool, huh? Man, you’re cruel… You got me the same way last year.

Yukiko Amagi: I don’t recall doing that.

Cycling student: Whoa, you serious? So then, you wanna hang out sometime!?

Yukiko Amagi: …I’d rather not.

Cycling student: That’ll teach me to get my hopes up… Anyways, you two better not pick on the transfer student too much.

Chie Satonaka: We’re just curious, is all!

Yukiko Amagi: U-Um, I’m sorry for dragging you into this…

Chie Satonaka: C’mon, let’s go. Everyone’s staring.

Chie Satonaka: Ah… so you came here because of your parents’ job. Haha, I thought it was something way more serious. There really is nothing here, huh? That’s what makes it nice, but there is nothing much we can show to people from outside. Though, there is something from Mt. Yasogami… I think our dyed clothes or pottery or something is kinda famous. Oh wait, and there’s the Amagi Im! Yukiko’s family runs it. It’s the pride of Inaba!

Yukiko Amagi: Huh? It’s… just an old inn.

Chie Satonaka: No way, it’s been in all sortsa magazines as a hidden treasure. It’s a great inn! It’s been going for generations, and Yukiko here is going to take over someday. Their inn actually attracts a lot of visitors to Inaba. It pretty much keeps this town going.

Yukiko Amagi: …I don’t think that’s entirely true.

Chie Satonaka: So, tell me. You think Yukiko’s cute, huh?

”I think so, yeah.” ✔
”It’s hard to say.”
”……”

Chie Satonaka: I knew it!

Yukiko Amagi: Come on… Don’t start this again…

Chie Satonaka: She’s really popular at school, but she’s never had a boyfriend. Kinda weird, huh?

Yukiko Amagi: C-Come on, stop it. Y-You shouldn’t believe that, okay? It’s not true that I’m popular or that I’ve never had a boyfriend! Wait, n-no! What I meant to say was, I-I don’t need a boyfriend! Geez… Chie!

Chie Satonaka: Hahaha! Sorry, I’m sorry. But this is our chance to talk to someone from the big city, and you barely said a word! Hey, what’s that?

Shopping housewife: So that high schooler left school early, and as she came down this street…

Spectator housewife: Wow. Who could imagine THAT hanging from an antenna?

Shopping housewife: I wanted to see it too.

Spectator housewife: Uh, you got here too late… The police and fire department took it down just a moment ago.

Shopping housewife: Well, I think it’s terrifying. I can’t believe a dead body showed up around here.

Chie Satonaka: Wait… What did she just say? A dead body!?

Ryotaro Dojima: Hey, what’re you doing here?

”Did something happen?”
”We were curious.”
”We’re just passing by.” ✔

Ryotaro Dojima: Huh… I should have figured that’d happen. That damn principal. We told him not to let them through here…

Chie Satonaka: …You know this guy?

Ryotaro Dojima: I’m Detective Dojima, his guardian. Ohh… Well, how should I say this… hope you get along with him. But you three really ought to stop wandering around and head straight home.

Young detective: Ngh… Uuuurrghhh…

Ryotaro Dojima: Adachi! How long are you going to act like a rookie? You want to be sent back to the central office!?

Young detective: I-I’m sorry… Nngh…

Ryotaro Dojima: *sigh* Go wash your face. We’re gonna go around and gather information!

Chie Satonaka: Was this what that announcement was about…?

Yukiko Amagi: What do they mean… it was hanging from the antenna…?

Chie Satonaka: Hey, Yukiko…? Why don’t we go to Junes some other time?

Yukiko Amagi: Good idea…

Chie Satonaka: Alright then, we’re taking off. Starting tomorrow, neighbor, let’s do our best!

> The two of them left. You decide to head away from the crime scene…

Nanako Dojima: I wonder if Dad’s not coming home again tonight…

Announcer: Our top story this evening concerns a bizarre case in a quiet suburb. Around noon today, a woman was found dead near the Samegawa River in Inaba.

> The School Zone is being shown on TV. Could this be the incident you heard about…?

Announcer: The deceased has been identified as Ms. Mayumi Yamano, a 27 -year-old announcer at the local television station. The initial results of the Inaba Police Department’s investigation have revealed…

Nanako Dojima: Ah! The Inaba Police Department! Th-That’s where dad works!

”Are you worried about him?”
”It’ll be all right.” ✔
”……”

Nanako Dojima: …I know. That’s his job, so this stuff happens.

Announcer: The body was found hanging from a large television antenna atop a local resident’s roof. Authorities are uncertain as to why the body was in such a state. With the cause of death also uncertain, police continue to investigate whether the death is an accident or a homicide. A thick fog common to the area has slowed their progress, and plans to fully canvass the area are delayed until tomorrow.

> It seems that the local TV station’s announcer was found dead near the Yasogami High School campus. The announcer, Mayurni Yamano… Her affair with a local councilman’s secretary had been on the news just the other day.

Nanako Dojima: They found her on the roof? That’s scary… Oh, it’s Junes!

Commercial: At Junes, every day is Customer Appreciation Day. Come see for yourself, and get in touch with our products! Every day’s great at your Junes!

Nanako Dojima: Every day’s great at your Junes!

> Nanako is looking at you expectantly…

”Do you like that song?” ✔
”You’re a good singer.”
”Your Junes!”

Nanako Dojima: Yep. It’s popular at school too.

> Nanako sings the song to herself over and over again. It seems that she’s forgotten all about the scary story.

CHAPTER 2: The Midnight Channel
> You’re still tired from getting used to your new life… You should return to your room and rest…

April 13th, 2011. Wednesday.
[You go to school and see a student fall off his bike. He turns out to be so clumsy that he falls headfirst into a trash can…]

Rolling student: S-someone…

> Maybe you should help him…

Rolling student: Whew, you saved me. Thanks! Umm… Oh yeah, that's right. You're that transfer student, Yu Narukami.

”Nice to meet you too.”
”Are you okay?” ✔
”Is your bike okay?”

Rolling student: Oh yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I’m Yosuke Hanamura. Nice to meet ya.

> Yosuke seems to be all right…

Yosuke Hanamura: Say, did you hear about the incident from yesterday? They found that announcer lady hanging from an antenna! You think it was some kinda warning? There's no way something that weird could've been an accident.

”You might be right.” ✔
”I don't know.”

Yosuke Hanamura:Dangling a dead body over a roof like that… That’s just messed up. Then again, it's pretty messed up to kill someone in the first place. Oh crap, we're late! You wanna ride? It's a little squeaky, but it should be fine.

[You run to your school with Yosuke.]

Mr. Morooka: Be quiet, idiots! You guys ARE in high school, aren’t you!? Can’t you shut up during class? Don’t you have any common sense? First of all, my job is to waste my precious time teaching you assholes philosophy! And since I’m so nice… I’ll straighten up your rotten attitudes while I’m at it! Aren’t you honored!? And I’ll be going especially hard on any of you morons that’re curious about the murder! Got it!? Now, get your books out!

> You listened to the lecture intently… Your Knowledge has increased.

[After classes.]

Yosuke Hanamura: So, you getting used to this place?

”Yeah.” ✔
”Not yet.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Wow, that was fast. There isn’t much to do here compared to the big city, but there is that certain… something you can’t get anywhere else. The air's clean, the food's great… Oh, know about the local delicacy? It’s grilled steak, man! Like that’s anything special, huh? I know a place where you can get it cheap. Wanna come? You helped me out this morning, so it's on me.

Chie Satonaka: What about me, huh? No apologies? My ”Trial of the Dragon.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Urgh… You always come around when I'm talking about food…

Chie Satonaka: How about it, Yukiko? Don’t you think he should treat us, too?

Yukiko Amagi: I'll pass… I don't want to gain any more weight. I need to help out at the inn today, anyway.

Yosuke Hanamura: Wow, Yukiko-san! You started training to take over the business?

Yukiko Amagi: It's not like that! I'm just helping out when it gets busy. Well, I should be on my way.

Chie Satonaka: Oh well. We should get going too.

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Do I seriously have to treat two people…?

> Junes, Food court…

Chie Satonaka: THIS is the cheap place you were talking about…? They don’t have grilled steak here.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, well, once you hopped on the freeloader train, I had to change my plans.

Chie Satonaka: Still, that’s no reason to take us to your place.

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude, this isn’t my place or anything. (to you) Oh, right. I haven't told you yet, huh? I moved here from another city about six months back. This location just opened up, and my dad was assigned to manage it. So our entire family came out here. (give you a soda) Here, this is to welcome you to town. Satonaka, yours is on me too.

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, I know.

> The conversation became animated over small talk…

Chie Satonaka:It’s only been half a year since this place opened up, but I haven’t been to the local shopping district much since. A lot of stores there started closing, and… Oh, uh…

Yosuke Hanamura: …You can't blame it all on Junes, can you? Hey… It’s Saki—senpai! Sorry, be right back.

”Who’s that?”
”Is she Yosuke’s girlfriend?” ✔

Chie Satonaka: Haha, he wishes. That’s Saki Konishi. Her family runs a liquor store in the shopping district. …I think she’s working here part-time, though.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, how's it going? You look beat.

Saki Konishi: Heeey! I’m finally on break… What’s up, Hana-chan? Boosting the family business by bringing your friends here?

Yosuke Hanamura: Madam, you wound me! Kidding aside… You look down. Did something happen?

Saki Konishi: …It’s nothing. I’m just a little tired.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, if you need to talk, I'm always willing to listen. I…

Saki Konishi: *chuckle* I’m okay. Thanks, though. *sigh* Why’d I leave school early yesterday…? Hey… is he the kid who transferred here? (she approach you) Are you the transfer student? Oh, did you hear about me already? It must be nice to have someone else from the big city to talk to, huh? I don’t see Hana-chan hanging out with the other guys much.

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh--not necessarily…

Saki Konishi: He doesn’t have too many friends, so I hope you two get along good. Hana-chan’s a good guy, but he can get nosy sometimes. You gotta tell him right to his face when he starts to annoy you.

”Yeah, he’s annoying.”
”That’s not true.”
”Nah, he’s a great guy.” ✔

Saki Konishi: Ahaha, I know… I’m just kidding. Well, my break’s just about over. Back to work I go…

Yosuke Hanamura: C-C'mon, Sempai. There's no need to worry about something like that.

Saki Konishi: Well, my break's just about over. Back to work I go… Laters!

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, uh, Senpai…! Hahah, Saki-senpai says I’m annoying, but she’s even nosier than me. She has a younger brother, and she treats me pretty much the same way…

Chie Satonaka: Ohhh, you don’t want her treating you like a brother, huh? Haha, I get it… So that’s how it is… The daughter of a local family-run liquor store and the scion of the invading chain… Hoho, the flame of forbidden love!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wha--!? Dude, it's not like that.

Chie Satonaka: Oh reaaaally… Well, I know just the thing to cheer up that lovesick heart. You ever hear of the Midnight Channel? You’re supposed to look into a TV that’s switched off, alone, exactly at midnight on a rainy night. While you’re staring at your own image, another person will appear on the screen… And they say that person’s your soulmate.

Yosuke Hanamura: What? For a second, I thought you were actually going to say something useful… How can you get all excited over such a childish urban legend like that?

Chie Satonaka: Childish, huh? You don’t believe it, do you!? Well, it’s raining tonight! Let’s all try it out--then you’ll see!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wow, I’m trying to remember the last time I heard something this stupid… Ooh, what if the culprit behind it was still lurking around…? Heehee…

Chie Satonaka: Sheesh, you shouldn’t joke about stuff like that. Now who’s the childish one…? All I am saying is, you guys better try it out tonight.

> You heard the rumor about the Midnight Channel, where one can see one’s soulmate on a rainy night. Maybe you should try it out tonight…

> Another dinner alone with Nanako…

Ryotaro Dojima: I’m back. Did anything happen while I was out? I’m sorry… Been busy at work. Can you put the news on for me?

Announcer: Next, more details in the developing story on the incident in foggy Inaba. Mayumi Yamano’s dead body was found hanging above a house in this isolated rural town. It is confirmed that Ms. Yamano had been involved in an affair with Taro Namatame, husband of enka singer Misuzu Hiiragi.

> It’s a follow-up report about the incident yesterday… When Ms. Yamano, the TV announcer, was alive, she was having an affair with a councilman’s secretary… The man’s wife seems to be Misuzu Hiiragi, an enka singer… Could the incident be tied to their lovers’ quarrel…?

Announcer: The police plan to investigate this relationship and question any personnel involved with them. In addition, we now bring you an exclusive interview with the local student who found Ms. Yamano’s body.

Ryotaro Dojima: *sigh* An interview with the kid…? Where the hell did they find her?

Reporter: What went through your mind when you saw it? Could you tell she was dead? Did you see her face?

> The female student’s face and voice are indistinct. But you feel like you’ve seen her before somewhere…

Reporter: Don’t you think it’s scary that someone was killed on a foggy day?

Female student: Huh…? She was killed?

Reporter: Oh, errr… So did you see anyone suspicious around here? We heard that you found it when you left school early. Did you have some personal business to take care of?

> The reporter’s enthusiasm seems to be perplexing the girl. Looking closely… she reminds you of Saki Konishi, Yosuke’s senpai…

Announcer: —a tragedy that occurred near the local shopping district. Many storeowners are raising concerns about losing customers as a result…

Ryotaro Dojima: Hmph. If they lose more customers, it’ll be because you’re making such a stink about it…

Commentator: It really is a bizarre case, isn’t it? I mean, hanging someone upside down from an antenna… I’d have to say it’s a warning or a sign from the culprit.

Announcer: Yes, but so far, no one has come forward to take credit for the crime.

Ryotaro Dojima: Loads of prank calls, though…

Commentator: So the cause of death is still unknown? And they don’t have a circle suspect yet? Taxpayers’ funds are going to a police force who can’t even figure out if this is an accident or a homicide?

Announcer: We’ll be right back after these messages.

Commercial: At Junes, every day is Customer Appreciation Day. Come see for yourself, and get in touch with our products! Every day’s great at your Junes!

Nanako Dojima: Every day’s great at your Junes! Hey Dad… Can we go to Junes together sometime?

> He seems to be asleep… The rain falls into the night… You’re reminded that you made a promise to test out the rumors of this Midnight Channel. You should check it out in your room…

Watch TV in your room ✔
Not just yet

> You can hear it raining outside… It’s almost midnight…

> ”Your soulmate appears if you look into a TV on a rainy night”… Could Chie’s story be true…?

[You are standing in your room. It's dark outside, it's raining and thundering. You slowly walk over to the television. The screen shows nothing but your reflection. You smile at your own naivety and turn away, when suddenly something begins to happen. The screen lights up. Among the static, you can see the image of a girl. Your head begins to hurt. You hear a voice.]

The Truth: I am thou… Thou art I… Thou art the one, who opens the door…

[Your head stops hurting. Nothing is displayed on the TV screen. You touch the screen and you start to get sucked in. You scream with booing, but you manage to get your hand out.]

Nanako Dojima: Are you okay…?

”I'm okay.” ✔
”Kind of…”
”Did I wake you up?”

Nanako Dojima: Okay. Well, good night.

>Nanako seems to have returned to her room. You decide to talk about it with the others tomorrow.

April 14th, 2011. Thursday.
Chie Satonaka: Perfect timing! Sorry, move over!

> Chie forced herself under your umbrella…

Chie Satonaka: I did have my own, but I saw this kung fu movie where they used an umbrella to pull some sweet moves… And… I accidentally broke mine trying to mimic the movie. By the way… did you see it!?

”I did.”
”See what?” ✔

Chie Satonaka: You know, the thing we were talking about yesterday. That Midnight Channel… Never mind. I’ll save it for when the other are around. We’re gonna be late for school. I-It’s kinda awkward to only bring this up now, but… we’re pretty close here… U-Um, I’m gonna just go ahead and run the rest of the way!

”Don’t worry about it.”
”You’ll catch a cold.”
”Then let’s race!” ✔

Chie Satonaka: Huh!? We’re BOTH gonna run through the rain? What’s the point in that? Besides, it’s not like I wanted to make a break for it… Haha, am I worrying too much? Eh, I’ll keep going with you anyway.

[School.]

Kimiko Sofue: Hello, everyone. My name is Kimiko Sofue, and I don’t know how much you know about world history, but I’m an expert. First, a little about me. I love to use my dowser to look for lost items, and there’s nothing quite like a romance. In fact, world history is a magnificent romance. History is like a river, it was born in the past and flows ever forward. I hope we can all enjoy the profundity of history together. Hohoho. And since this is my first lecture, I’ll start with an easy mention. Our transferee, Mr. Narukami, please stand up. The western calendar is based on Anno Domini, the traditionally believed year of Jesus Christ’s birth. What is the year before 1 AD called?
”0 AD.”
”1 BC.” ✔
”-1 AD.”

> You gave the answer you think is correct…

Kimiko Sofue: Ah, you seem to understand this well. If you think that history is like math, 0 AD would be the natural motion, but world history is much more complicated The Gregorian calendar we use today is . . on the Julian calendar, which was made w there was no concept of the zero as a o That’s why, when counting backwards, we go from 1 AD straight to 1 BC. Hopefully that was a nice introduction to world history…

> You gave the correct answer… Your Knowledge has increased.

[The classes is over.]

Short girl: What's up with the body being hung upside-down? That's so freaky!

Sitting girl: Is it to be like, mimicking an execution? It's messed up…

Short girl: My senpai told me it was a third-year named Saki who found the body.

Yosuke Hanamura: (walks in) Y-Yo. Um… It's, uh, it's not really that important, but… Well, yesterday on TV, I… Oh, uhh… Never mind. Look, I’ll tell you later. Ahaha…

Chie Satonaka: (walks in) Yosuke, did you hear the rumor? Saki—senpai’s supposedly the one who discovered that body.

Yosuke Hanamura: I wonder if that's why she looked so down… She doesn't seem to be at school today either.

Chie Satonaka: Huh? Hey Yukiko, are you helping out at the inn today too?

Yukiko Amagi: Things are really out of hand right now… I'm sorry. (leaves)

Yosuke Hanamura: Is it just me, or does Yukiko-san seem way stressed out today?

Chie Satonaka: I guess they’re running her ragged… By the way, did see… it… last night?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh…? Uh, well… What about you?

Chie Satonaka: I did! I seriously saw a girl! But… my soulmate’s a girl? What’s that supposed to mean? I couldn't quite tell who it was, but it was a girl for sure… Her hair was brown, about shoulder length. She was wearing our school uniform, and…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey… I think that's the same person I saw. I couldn't make out that nuch detail, though. The image I saw was much blurrier…

Chie Satonaka: Wait, so you saw it too!? And we saw the same girl…? Does that mean… we have the same soulmate?

Yosuke Hanamura: How should I know? How ‘bout you? Did see it?

> You told them about what happened last night.

Yosuke Hanamura: It sounds like we all saw the same person… But weird voices aside, what was that about getting sucked into your TV…? Were you that tired last night? You must've just fallen asleep in front of your TV.

Chie Satonaka: That’d be one interesting dream, though. I like the part where you got stuck ’cause your TV was too small. That’s pretty realistic. If it had been bigger-- Ohhh, that reminds me. Our family’s been talking about buying a bigger TV.

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh yeah? Well, flatscreen TVs are definitely in these days. Wanna go check ’em out on the way back? We’re beefing up our electronic department this month.

Chie Satonaka: Oh, definitely! My parents don’t know any about electronics, and I’ve just gotta see my kung-fu movies on the big screen! Hwa-taaaa!

Yosuke Hanamura: We've got some pretty big ones in stock. I bet they'd be big enough for you to fit into, hehe.

> They don’t believe you at all… You decided to go to Junes with the others.

> Junes, Electronics department…

Chie Satonaka: Wow, this is huge! And… Holy crap, it’s expensive! Who buys something like this?

Yosuke Hanamura: I dunno… Rich folks? Honestly, not many people shop for TVs here. That's why we don't have clerks around.

Chie Satonaka: Huh… Not worth trying then, I guess. Well, at least looking’s free.

Yosuke Hanamura: (touches the screen) …Nope, can’t get in. Figures.

Chie Satonaka: Haha, this proves it. It was all just a dream.

Yosuke Hanamura: Besides, these flat-screen TVs are so thin, you'd just end up on the other side… Argh, what am I saying!? So, Chie. What kind of TV are you guys in the market for?

Chie Satonaka: They said they wanted one that’s cheap. You got any suggestions?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, Miss, might I suggest this one over here? It’s the newest model, just released this spring…

Chie Satonaka: Wha—-that’s not cheap at all! There’s way too many zeroes!

Yosuke Hanamura: I should've asked what you meant by ”cheap” right off the bat.

Chie Satonaka: You’ve got connections, right? C’mon, hook me up!

Yosuke Hanamura: You know I can't do that… Hey, how about this one over here? It’s a display unit. It’s a little old, but…

> With a TV this big, you really might be able to go inside…

[You touch the screen and your palm sinks into the TV. Your friends don't notice and continue talking.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh yeah, Yu, what kind of TV do you--

Chie Satonaka: Huh? Something wrong, Yosuke?

Yosuke Hanamura: I-ls his arm… in the TV…?

Chie Satonaka: Whoa… Uhhh… Is that some kinda… new model? L—Like with a new function?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hell no! (runs to you)

Chie Satonaka: (runs to you) You gotta be kidding me… Did you really stick your hand through the screen?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh man… This is for real… That's some magic trick, man! So how's it work, huh!? What's the magician's secret!?

> Both of them are staring at you, astonished… You might be able to put in more than just your arm…

[You put your head into the TV…]

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hey, don't do that! What're you doing!?

Chie Satonaka:Oh my God!!

> There’s empty space inside…

Yosuke Hanamura:Wh-What do you mean, ”inside”!?

Chie Satonaka: Wh—What do you mean, ”empty space”!?

> It seems very spacious in here…

Yosuke Hanamura:Wh-What do you mean, ”spacious”!?

Chie Satonaka: I mean, what’s going on!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Holy crap… I-I think this is all too much for my bladder…

Chie Satonaka: What the-—? Are you gonna pee your pants!?

Yosuke Hanamura: I've been holding it in all day! I-I haven't had a chance to go… Aaarrgh! Can’t… hold it… anymore…! (runs away and quickly gets back) Shit! Customers! They're coming!

Chie Satonaka: What!? But we’ve got a guy half stuck in the TV here! Wh—What’re we gonna do!?

[They run around in a panic and push you inside the TV and fall in there themselves.]

Yosuke Hanamura: What the!? W-Wai--WHOA!!

[They fall, hitting the floor painfully.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Ouch!… I landed right on my wallet!

Chie Satonaka: Man… where the heck are we? What is this place? Some place inside Junes?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hell no it isn’t! I mean, we fell through a TV! Actually… uh… what is going on here?

Chie Satonaka: So… uh… we’re still alive… Right?

”Where are we?”
”Are you guys okay?” ✔
”Is this a dream?”

> Your Understanding has increased.

Yosuke Hanamura: I think my butt's cracked now…

Chie Satonaka: Of course it is!

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa!

Chie Satonaka: Wh—What now!? Did you wet your pants!?

Yosuke Hanamura: No, stupid! Look around!

Chie Satonaka: Is this… a studio? All this fog… Or is it smoke? There's no place like this in Inaba, is there…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hell no… But man… this place is huge…

Chie Satonaka: What're we gonna do…?

”Let's look around.” ✔
”Let's go home.”
”It's up to you.”

Chie Satonaka: Huh? B-But… Look, we need to get home and – H-Huh…? Wait a minute… Which way did we come in from? I don’t see a way in… or out!

Yosuke Hanamura: What? That can't be right! H-How could that be!?

Chie Satonaka: I don’t know! Don’t ask me! I can’t take this anymore! I wanna go home!

Yosuke Hanamura: Okay… so how!?

”Let’s calm down.”
”Let’s look for a way out.” ✔
”We’re doomed. ”

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-You're right. Okay… okay. Let's calm down and think about this. All right, so we need to find a way out.

Chie Satonaka: Is there really a way outta here…?

Yosuke Hanamura: We got in… so we must be able to get somehow.

Chie Satonaka: That's true, but…

Yosuke Hanamura: If there’s no exit, we’re trapped, so let’s cross our fingers and look around.

Chie Satonaka: What is this place…? It feels different from where We were before…

Yosuke Hanamura: It looks like we’re in some kinda building, but… Damn, this fog’s so thick, I can hardly see.

Chie Satonaka: Are you sure we’re not wandering farther away?

Yosuke Hanamura: I can't be positive, but we've gotta trust our instinct a little.

Chie Satonaka: I know, but…

> It seems that there’s no choice for now but to continue onward…

[They enter someone’s room.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, is it me or is the fog lighter here? (pull out his phone) No service. What a surprise…

Chie Satonaka: Can’t you guys slow down a little? It’s hard enough to see where you’re going… Huh? What the…!? (the room is stained with red and yellow) It's a dead end! There's exit!

Yosuke Hanamura: It keeps getting creepier and creepier the further we go… Aargh! I can't hold it any longer… My bladder's gonna explode…! (runs up to the wall)

Chie Satonaka: Yosuke!? What’re you doing!?

Yosuke Hanamura: I gotta let it out before I piss my pants!

Chie Satonaka: You’re going here!? Oh, you have got to be kidding…

Yosuke Hanamura: T-Turn around! I can't go if everyone's watching ! Aaaaargh… I can’t do it! It’s all your fault if my bladder bursts!

Chie Satonaka: Like I care… Anyways… what’s with this room? Check out these posters… Their faces are all cut out… Someone must really hate this person…

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude… this chair and rope… That kind of arrangement is never good… It's tied in a noose… Is this a scarf?

Chie Satonaka: C’mon… Let’s go back to where we came from and look somewhere else for an exit…
Yosuke Hanamura: Hey… I think I've seen that poster before…

Chie Satonaka: Who CARES!? Let’s go! I’m sick of this place! And I’m not feeling so good…

Yosuke Hanamura: Now that you mention it, me too…

> Your body does feel heavy… Could it be due to this place’s oppressive atmosphere…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright, let's go back. I'm seriously starting to feel sick…

Chie Satonaka: Whew… We finally made it back here… Wait… What's that… ?

Yosuke Hanamura: Th-There's something over there!

Chie Satonaka: What is this thing? A monkey? A bear…?

Yosuke Hanamura: What in the world…?

Mysterious bear: Th—That’s what I wanna know! Who are you guys…?

Chie Satonaka: *gasp* It talked!! W-What are you!? Y-You wanna fight!?

Mysterious bear: D—Don’t yell at me like that…

> The bear is cowering in fear… Maybe it would be better to ask him nicely…

”What is this place?”
”What are you?” ✔
”Is this a dream?”

Mysterious bear: I’m a bear. Can’t you tell? I live here by myself. I’ve always lived here. It doesn’t have a name.

Yosuke Hanamura: You… live here?

Mysterious bear: If I was you guys, I’d hurry back to the other side. Someone’s been throwing people in here. It’s a big headache.

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Throwing people in? What’re you talking about?

Mysterious bear: I dunno who's doing it! I just want them to think before they go doing things like that!

Chie Satonaka: Hey, what’s your problem? What gives YOU the right to yell at us like that!? What ARE you!? Where are we!? What the heck’s going on here!?

Mysterious bear: I already told you… A-Anyways, you should hurry back.

Yosuke Hanamura: What it comes down to is, you want us to get outta here, right? Well, so do we! We just don't know how, damnit!

Mysterious bear: Urrrrgh! That's why I'm saying I'll let you out!

Yosuke Hanamura: Like I keep saying, we don’t know where the frickin’ exit—— Wait… What?

[A three TV appears before his eyes.]

Chie Satonaka: Wh—Where did those TVs come from!?

Mysterious bear: Okay, now go, go, get outta here! I’m a busy bear!

Chie Satonaka: What’s going on now!? Whoa! Hey, what’re you doing!

Yosuke Hanamura: S-Stop pushing!

[They return to the real world.]

Chie Satonaka: Huh? Is this…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Did we… make it back?

Store announcement: Attention, shoppers. Our daily limited time sale will now begin at the side dish area on the first floor. Why not try the delicious, fresh produce Junes picked for you this morning as your side dish for dinner tonight? All ages are invited to take advantage of this incredible bargain!

Yosuke Hanamura: Crap, it’s already that late!?

Chie Satonaka: Looks like we were in there for quite a while…

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s right… Now I remember where I saw that poster before… Look over there! That's the poster we saw!

Chie Satonaka: What’s up now? Hey, you’re right, they’re the same. I couldn’t tell before without the face, but it was Misuzu Hiiragi… She’s been all over the news lately. Something about… her husband having an affair with that announcer lady who die the other day.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, so does that mean…? That weird room we saw… Could it be related to that Yamano lady’s death…? Now that I think about it… there was that creepy noose hanging from the ceiling… Yaaargh, stop! No more! We gotta stop talking about this. I’m gonna wipe what happened today from my brain. I don’t think my poor heart can take anymore.

Chie Satonaka: I’m feeling a chill too… Let’s go home… I wanna lie down and rest.

[You get home.]

> You still feel sluggish…

Ryotaro Dojima: Hey, welcome home. Uh——Hmm… Well, I doubt you’d know… But have you heard anything about a student named Saki Konishi?

”She discovered the body.”
”People feel sorry for her.”
”She wasn’t at school today.” ✔

Ryotaro Dojima: Oh. I see… To be honest… we got a call from her family. She’s disappeared. We’ve got people looking for her, but she hasn’t been found yet… *sigh* Work just keeps piling up…

Announcer: And now, more on the case still casting a shadow over the foggy town of Inaba. Not long ago, television announcer Mayumi Yamano was found dead in the small town. Up until now, her whereabouts prior to her death had been unknown. But the police investigation has found that she had been staying in the region’s famous Amagi Inn.

> The Amagi Inn… It’s the inn that Yukiko’s family runs…

Announcer: She had apparently been staying there alone. Perhaps she was taking a vacation to recover from her ordeal…?

Commentator: Oh yes, the Amagi Inn! Their hot springs are first-rate. The manager’s teenage daughter also works there, and it’s rumored that she’ll take over the inn this spring. If that happens, she’ll be one of the youngest managers on record! I should book another trip there!

Announcer: Uhh… I see… Moving along, it’s time for the weather report. The rain has begun to subside. From now until morning, heavy fog warning will be in effect in the Inaba region. Visibility will be severely reduced, so please be careful if you plan on driving in the area…

> The news continues.

> Just before the announcer was found dead, she was apparently staying at the Amagi Inn, run by Yukiko’s family… And it seems the whereabouts of Saki Konishi, who discovered the body, are unknown…

Nanako Dojima: Is the ramen ready now?

Ryotaro Dojima: Give it some more time.

> You sneezed. You feel a slight chill…

Ryotaro Dojima: Are you sick? You’re probably still adjusting to the new environment. Nanako, could you get him some cold medicine? You should get to bed after you take it.

CHAPTER 3: Izanagi
April 15th, 2011. Friday.
[We see a small animated clip of a girl's corpse hanging from a pole… You wake up and go down to the first floor.]

> You should rest early today…

Ryotaro Dojima: Ah, you’re up. Well, I’m off.

> Dojima left the house…

Nanako Dojima: …Dad has to go do something. He got a call, so he left.

> Nanako looks worried…

> You can hear girls gossiping…

Red umbrella girl: When I looked, I saw three police cars zooming by.

White umbrella girl: You live by the police station, don’t you? Did you hear anything?

Red umbrella girl: I heard some yelling, but nothing more. Total disappointment.

White umbrella girl: Geez, you need to pay more attention to stuff like that. How else are we supposed to get the juicy stories?

> You hear sirens nearby… It seems there’s been an incident… You decide to head to school.

Rumor-loving girl: Hey… Did you see it yesterday?

Long-haired girl: Of course not… What, is that rumor for real?

Rumor-loving girl: I dunno, but it seems like a lot of people have seen it.

> You overhear people gossiping about something.

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko said she’d be here after lunch… I wonder why they’re holding a school assembly all of a sudden. …Hey, what’s wrong, Yosuke?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, it's nothing…

Ms. Sofue: Everyone, please settle down. The school assembly is about to begin. First, the Principal has something to say.

Principal: I… regret to say that I have a terrible announcement for all of you. One of our third-year students, Ms. Saki Konishi of Class 3… …has passed away.

Chie Satonaka: Passed away…!?

Yosuke Hanamura: ……

Principal: Ms. Konishi was found deceased early this morning… The reasons behind her passing are currently under investigation by the police. If they ask you for your cooperation, I urge you, as students of this school, to provide only the facts. All right, please quiet down… I have been assured by the faculty that there’s been no evidence that bullying was involved in the incident. So mind what you say, not only to the police but to anyone who asks…

Chie Satonaka: Found dead…? How could this happen…?

Yosuke Hanamura: ……

> The Principal’s address continues…

[After a while, you and your friends are walking along the school corridor and you hear the voices of two girls.]

Rumor-loving girl: She died the same way as that announcer, right? That’s so creepy…

Girl’s friend: Well, last time, it was from an antenna, but this time she was hanging from a telephone pole. It’s gotta be a serial murder case…

Rumor-loving girl: Someone said the cause of death was some unknown poison.

Girl’s friend: Unknown…? C’mon, this isn’t some sci-fi drama. Oh, by the way, did you hear? Someone saw a girl that looked like Saki on that Midnight Channel thingie. They said she totally looked like she was in pain. Isn’t that scary?

Rumor-loving girl: Haha, sounds like someone had a nightmare. The media’s been broadcasting their interviews with her nonstop, so maybe they just had Saki on the brain.

[They leave.]

Chie Satonaka: Sheesh, it’s easy to toss around theories if you’re not personally involved…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey… Did you guys check out the TV last night?

Chie Satonaka: Yosuke! Not you too!

Yosuke Hanamura: Just listen for a sec! Something kept bothering me, so… I watched it again, and… I think the girl on the screen… was Saki-senpai. There's no mistaking it… Senpai looked like… she was writhing in pain…And then… she disappeared from the screen.

Chie Satonaka: What?

Yosuke Hanamura: You heard Senpai’s body was found in a similar situation as that announcer’s, right…? Well, remember that guy you told us about? How he was all excited that his soulmate was the announcer? Maybe… Just maybe, but… Ms. Yamano might’ve been on that Midnight Channel before she died, too.

Chie Satonaka: What’s that supposed to mean…? Hold on… Are you saying…? People who appear on that TV… die…?

Yosuke Hanamura: I can't say for sure. But something tells me… I just can’t dismiss it as coincidence.

Chie Satonaka: ……

Yosuke Hanamura: Plus, remember what that bear thing said? How that place was dangerous, and we should leave before the fog clears…? It also said that someone’s been throwing people in there. And that room with the posters on the wall… It has to have something to do with the announcer’s death. I mean… don’t you think there’s some kind of connection there? Couldn't that world in the TV have something to do with Senpai and the announcer's death!? Well…? What do you think…?

”You might be right.” ✔
”That's preposterous.”

Yosuke Hanamura: …So it's not just me, huh? If there is a connection, then it’s a good bet that the two of them went inside that world. That would explain the posters in that room. Which means… if we look around, we might find a place that has something to do with Senpai, too.

Chie Satonaka: Yosuke, don't tell me…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah… I’m thinking about going in again. I want to find out for myself.

Chie Satonaka: D-Don’t do this… You should just let the police handle this and--

Yosuke Hanamura: You think we can rely on the police!? They haven’t made any progress on the announcer’s case. Besides, even if we told them about the world inside the TV, there's no way they're gonna believe us! If I’m completely off-base with this, that’s fine… It's just… I need to know why Senpai had to die like this.

Chie Satonaka: Yosuke…

Yosuke Hanamura: After what I’ve seen and what I’ve put together, there’s no way I can ignore it now… Sorry… but you’re the only person who can help me. I’m gonna go get ready. I’ll be waiting for you at Junes. (runs away)

> Yosuke has asked you to take him into the TV world again…

Chie Satonaka: I can kinda understand how he feels… But we can’t be sure we’ll be able to get out safely again. What should we do…?

Go with Yosuke ✔
Stop Yosuke
Let Chie decide

Chie Satonaka: Y-You serious…? Anyways, let’s go to Junes. We can’t leave Yosuke alone…

[You come into an electronics store. Yosuke is standing with a golf club and a rope in his hands…]

Yosuke Hanamura: You guys came…!

Chie Satonaka: We came to stop you, idiot! C’mon… You really shouldn’t do this. It’s too dangerous.

Yosuke Hanamura: I know… But we were able to come back once, right? If we go in from the same location, maybe we’ll meet that bear again.

Chie Satonaka: ”Maybe” isn’t good enough!

Yosuke Hanamura: Look, I can’t just act like everyone else and pretend this has nothing to do with me.

Chie Satonaka: That's true, but…

Yosuke Hanamura: What about you? Could you just walk away?

”I can't leave it alone.”
”This doesn't involve me.”
”I'm worried about Chie.” ✔

> There’s no telling what may happen over there… You voiced your concern over Chie coming along. Your Understanding has increased.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, it’ll be just you and me. Don’t worry, I’m not going in without a plan. Chie, I’m leaving you in charge of this.

Chie Satonaka: Huh? What's that? A rope…?

Yosuke Hanamura: We’ll go in with this tied to me, so I want you to hold on to this and wait here.

Chie Satonaka: Wh-What? Then, this is a lifeline? C’mon, wait a sec…

Yosuke Hanamura: Here, Yu… This is for you. (give you the club and some medicine) I thought it might be better than going in empty-handed. Alright… Let’s go. There’s no use wasting any more time. Chie, whatever you do, don’t let go of the rope!

Chie Satonaka: H-Hey! I said wait!

[You and Yosuke enter the TV World. The rope cuts.]

Chie Satonaka: See…? I knew this wasn't gonna work… Now what…?

[Meanwhile…]

Yosuke Hanamura: Owww… Is this…? Look, this is the same place as last time! So they are connected from place to place!

Mysterious bear: Y-You guys… Why’d you come back…? I get it! You're the ones behind this!

Yosuke Hanamura: You’re that thing from last time…! Wait, what the hell did you just say!?

Mysterious bear: Lately, I can tell someone’s been throwing people in here. It’s making this world more and more messed up… This is the second time you guys came here. And I don’t think anyone forced you in. That means you’re the most suspicious! You guys must be the ones throwing the people in here, raaaawr!

”Hell no!”
”Don't label us like that.” ✔
”Shut up…”

Yosuke Hanamura: What’re you talking about, ”throwing people in”!? If someone was thrown in here and they couldn’t get out, they might die! Who would do such a-- Wait a sec… All this talk about someone throwing people in here… Does he mean Senpai and the announcer? Did that ”someone” throw those two in here? H-Hey… What do you think?

”That must be it.” ✔
”They accidentally fell in.”
”I don't know.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah… I agree. Let's assume he's telling the truth… Could it be that someone’s throwing people in here, intending to kill them…? If that's the case…

Mysterious bear: What’re you guys mumbling about? Why’d you come here, anyways!? It's a one-way door! You can't get out once you're in! Remember? How I had to let you guys out?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, whatever. We don't need your help this time! See, this time we have a lifeli-- Whaaaaat!? H-Hey! You better let us out once we're done investigating here!

Mysterious bear: Grrrrr! I’m the one who wants to investigate! I've lived here for a long time. But it's never been noisy like this till now. Do you have proof!? Prove to me you’re not throwing people in here!

”Proof!?”
”It doesn't work that way…” ✔
”Shut up.”

Mysterious bear: See! So it is you guys!

Yosuke Hanamura: For the last time, it’s not us, so we’ve got nothing to prove to you! Hey, you better answer our questions. This isn’t like last time, when we came by accident. We’re dead serious! Listen up, ’cause people have died in our world… Every time the fog appears, a dead body shows up with it. It has to be related to this place somehow! If you know something, tell us!

Mysterious bear: A dead body? Whenever the fog appears…? I know that if it’s foggy on your side, the fog lifts here. It’s really dangerous when the fog lifts. That’s when the Shadows get violent. Aaaah… I get it…

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh…? If you get it, then explain it to us, dammit! If it’s foggy on our side, it isn’t in here…? Shadows get violent…?

Mysterious bear: That’s why I said to hurry back! It’s dangerous when that happens! Okay, no more questions. I know you guys did it! You better stop right now!

Yosuke Hanamura: I’ve told you and told you, we’re not the ones doing it! I’ve about had it with you… Why the hell won’t you listen to what we’re saying!?

Mysterious bear: I-I’m just saying… you might be the culprits. I'm just making sure…

Yosuke Hanamura: What…? Man, this bear’s driving me nuts… What is this place, anyways? It looks like a TV studio… Is something being filmed here…? H-Hey, don’t tell me… Is that weird show being filmed here!?

Mysterious bear: Weird show? Filmed? What does that mean?

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh… I’m asking if someone’s been filming the people that get thrown in here.

Mysterious bear: ……? I don't get it… This world has always been like this. No one has ever done that filming thing here.

”Always been like this…?”
”What do mean?” ✔
”Run that by me again?”

Mysterious bear: Only me and Shadows are here! I told you before!

Yosuke Hanamura: Ugh… We don’t know what these Shadow things are! Or what you are either, for that matter! You keep telling us to prove our innocence, but you’re the most suspicious thing here! Maybe you’re the real culprit! And what’s with that stupid costume!? I’d say it’s time you showed your face! (tear off bear’s empty head) Wh-What the hell are you…? I-It’s empty inside…

Mysterious bear: Me…? The culprit…? I wouldn't do such a thing… I just live here… I just want to live here peacefully…

Yosuke Hanamura: ……

Mysterious bear: Okay. I’ll believe that you guys aren’t the culprits. But I want you to find the real guy who did all this. You have to stop him. Promise me, or else… I'm not gonna let you guys outta here.

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-You little…!

Mysterious bear: This can’t keep going on! My home here will be a complete mess! And then… and then… I… Waaah…

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What’re you crying for all of a sudden…? Geez, this thing’s really weirding me out…

> The mysterious bear is asking you to find the culprit behind this… Someone on the outside is throwing people into this world… If the culprit isn’t you, he wants you to find the real culprit… The mysterious bear seems serious about this…

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* Hey, what should we do?

> You remember the words of the mysterious old man who called himself Igor… ”It seems you will encounter a misfortune at your destination, and a great mystery will be imposed upon you…” Could this be the mystery that will be thrust upon you…? What was the ”contract” Igor spoke of…? Could finding the culprit and solving the case be part of this promise…? In any case, since you cannot leave the TV world on your own, there seems to be no other option…

Mysterious bear: You’re the only ones I can ask. Will you promise me…?

”I promise.”
”We've got choice…” ✔

Mysterious bear: Th-Thank you!

Yosuke Hanamura: Damn bear… Practically holding a gun to our heads… But… it’s true that we came here to figure things out. So far, we’re completely in the dark. Look for the culprit, huh…? Bring it on! You got my word, too. Might as well introduce ourselves… I’m Yosuke Hanamura, and this is my buddy Yu Narukami. You got a name?

Mysterious bear: …Teddie.

Yosuke Hanamura: *groan* Figures… But how are we supposed to find the culprit in the first place?

Teddie: I dunno… Oh, but I know where the last person came in.

Yosuke Hanamura: The last person…? You mean Saki-senpai!?

Teddie: I mean the person who came in and disappeared last time. I dunno the name. I'll take you there. You might find clues. Oh, one thing first. You two should put these on.

Yosuke Hanamura: What're these glasses for…?

> As you put on the glasses, your vision instantly becomes much clearer!

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa! The difference is like night and day. With these on, it's like the fog doesn't exist.

Teddie: They'll help you walk through the fog. …Well, I've been here for a long time. So you can rely on me! Uh… But I can only show you where the place is. You guys will have to defend yourselves.

Yosuke Hanamura: What happened to relying on you!? Th-There better be any monsters! You understand!? We brought weapons, but I mean… They’re more for show! We just got here! If it’s so dangerous, why don’t you do something instead of relying on us!?

Teddie: Uh uh. No way. I’ve got no muscles. Oh! Oh! I’ll give you guys moral support from a safe distance! How's that sound?

> Can Teddie really not fight…?

Try touching Teddie ✔
Try pushing Teddie
Try hitting Teddie

Teddie: (falls) N-Nooo…

Yosuke Hanamura: I-Is this thing for real!? Ugh, this is so lame… We swore to find the culprit and this is all the backup we get…?

Teddie: …Oh yeah. Can I ask you something? Who’s this Saki-senpai person? Someone you know?

Yosuke Hanamura: That doesn’t matter right now… Anyways, at least now we know Senpai might have been thrown in here. Maybe we can find more information, too. Let’s get moving, Yu.

Teddie: W-Waaaaait!

[You follow Yosuke.]

Yosuke Hanamura: What is this place…? It looks just like the shopping district… What’s going on here!?

Teddie: Some weird places have appeared here recently. Things are getting so tangled, I dunno what to do…

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh… by the way, why are you standing so far from us? …You better not be blaming to high-tail it if something does come up.

Teddie: Of course not! I mean. Uh. I can’t stand too close, you know. I’d get in your way…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hrrrm… Man, they really went all out on this… But out of all the places in town, why’d they replicate this one?

Teddie: How should I know? This is reality for the one who’s here.

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* As usual, nothing you say makes any sense… But if this is our shopping district, we’re not far from Saki-senpai’s… I knew it…! This is the liquor store that Senpai’s parents run. Does this mean… Senpai disappeared here? What could’ve happened…?

Teddie: W—Wait a second. Th-They’re here!

Yosuke Hanamura: What?

Teddie: …Shadows. I had a feeling they were going to attack…!

[Shadows appear from the portal in the store. They are ready to attack. Your head begins to hurt again and you hear a voice.]

The Truth: I am thou… Thou art I… The time has come… …open thine eyes and call forth what is within!

[A card appears in your hands. You turn it over and slowly say.]

Yu: Per… so… na.

[A stream of energy bursts out of you and a spirit appears behind. You ready for the fight.]

Teddie: Stay calm and listen. Some Shadows have weaknesses. If you can pinpoint that weakness and take advantage of it, the battle will be a lot easier! I can tell this one has a weakness too! Try stuff out and see what works! I’ll keep track of what attacks have what effects on enemies!

[You defeat the Shadows with your new power!]

> Your HP and SP have increased! Yu Narukami has faced his other self… He has obtained the facade used to overcome life’s hardships, the Persona Izanagi!

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa… Wh-What was that!? Did I hear you say ”Persona”!? What was it-- I mean, what did you do!? Hey, you think I can do it too…?

Teddie: Calm down, Yosuke. You're troubling Sensei!

Yosuke Hanamura: S-Sensei…?

Teddie: Gosh almighty! You're amazing, Sensei! I am one impressed bear! I can't believe you were hiding such an amazing power! No wonder the Shadows were scared of you! *gasp* Are you the one who's able to bring people into this world? Hah! That's what I thought! This is really something. Don't you think so, Yosuke?

Yosuke Hanamura: (kicks Teddie) Dude, you call him Sensei and then don't show me any respect!?

Teddie: Sorry…

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Well, your support wasn’t bad, though. I gotta give you some credit for that.

Teddie: Huh? R-Really…? Heehee.

Yosuke Hanamura: All right, you two keep it up, and I think we’ll be fine from here on out. Now let’s get back to the investigation!

[The team walks to the entrance to the Konishi’s store that leads to some different demension.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Man… I wonder what could have happened to Senpai here.

> Voices begin to echo from somewhere…

Voice 1: I wish Junes would go under…

Voice 2: It's all because of that store…

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What the…!?

Voice 3: Oh, I heard that Konishi-san’s daughter is working there.

Voice 4: Oh my… How could she, with her family’s business suffering like it is…?

Voice 5: I heard their sales have gone downhill because of Junes.

Yosuke Hanamura: S-Stop it…

Voice 6: That poor father… to have his own daughter working for the enemy.

Voice 7: What a troublesome child…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey… Hey, Ted! You said that this place is reality for those that are here, right!? So… does that mean this was Senpai’s reality when she wandered in here…?

Teddie: I… only know about what’s over here.

Yosuke Hanamura: Whatever’s going on here… We’ll find out ourselves!

[The team enters the Konishi’s store.]

CHAPTER 4: Shadow Yosuke
Yosuke Hanamura: Dammit, not again…

> You begin to hear a man yelling…

Middle-aged voice: Saki, how many times do I have to tell you!?

Yosuke Hanamura: I-Is this… Senpai’s dad…?

Middle-aged voice: You know what the neighbors say about you, right!? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? You’re the eldest daughter of a family who’s owned this store for generations! Is it the money? Or did you meet some guy there? Just tell me why you have to work THERE, of all places!

Yosuke Hanamura: I… I can't believe this… She seemed like she had fun at work… She never said anything like this to me… You’re telling me THIS was how Senpai really saw things!? These photos… Hey… Is this… ? It’s the photo we took the other day with the other part-timers at Junes… Wh-Why's it cut up like this… ?

> The scrap of the photo shows Saki Konishi smiling… Yosuke is standing next to her…

Saki’s voice: I… never had the chance to say it…

Yosuke Hanamura: Is that… Senpai's voice!?

Saki’s voice: I always wanted to tell Hana-chan…

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh…? Me…?

Saki’s voice: …that he was a real pain in the ass. I was nice to him just because he was the store manager's son, that's all… But he takes it completely the wrong way and gets all enthusiastic… What a dip.

Yosuke Hanamura: P-Pain in the ass…?

Saki's voice: Who cares about Junes, anyway? Because of that store, our business is ruined, my parents hate me, the neighbors talk behind my back… I wish everything would just disappear…

Yosuke Hanamura: I-It's a lie… This can't be… Senpai's not like that…!

Yosuke?: It's *sniff* so sad… I feel so sorry for myself… Boo hoo… Actually, I’m the one who thinks everything’s a pain in the ass. Hahaha…

Teddie: H-Huh? Two Yosukes…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Who are you!? I-I wouldn't think that…

Other Yosuke: Hahaha… Yeah, right. How long are you going to keep deluding yourself? Screw the shopping district, and Junes too! You’re sick of everything, especially living out in the sticks!

Yosuke Hanamura: What’re you saying…? That’s not true, I--

Other Yosuke: You put on a good show of being carefree and happy-go-lucky ’cause you’re so terrified of being alone. The more the merrier, right? You’ve gotta be surrounded by people to block out the pain of isolation. And what’s this about checking out this world for Saki-senpai’s sake? Hah! I know the real reason you came snooping…

Yosuke Hanamura: S-Stop it!

Other Yosuke: Hahaha! Why so panicked? I thought I was just spouting bullshit! Or maybe… I DO know everything you’re thinking! Why’s that…? Because I AM you! You just came because you thought it sounded like a good time! What else is there to do out in this shithole? A world inside the TV--now that’s exciting! You didn’t have a single other reason for coming here, did you!?

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s not true… Stop… Stop it…

Other Yosuke: You’re just trying to act like a big shot… If all went well, hey, maybe you could even be a hero! And that Senpai you were so sweet on? Her death was the perfect excuse!

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s not true! What are you!? Who are you!?

Other Yosuke: *chuckle* I already told ya. I’m you… Your Shadow… There’s nothing I don’t know about you!

Yosuke Hanamura: Screw that! I don't know you! (screams) You can’t be me, you son of a bitch!!

Other Yosuke: (laughs) That’s right! Say it again!

Yosuke Hanamura: You’re nothing like me!

Other Yosuke: Yeah, that’s right… I am me now. I’m not you anymore, see?

[Yosuke’s frightened. The Other Yosuke transforms into something else. A monster.]

Shadow Yosuke: I am a shadow… The true self… I’ll crush everything that bores me… Starting with you! (punches Yu) How long can you survive this?

Teddie: This one’s much stronger than the last type! Be careful! Whenever you feel threatened, just defend yourself!

[You fight the monster to save your friend!]

Shadow Yosuke: Heh, that’s it…? Boring… What a frickin’ pain in the ass…! Get outta my way!

[You defeat Shadow Yosuke!]

> You felt a surge of energy inside after the recent battle. Izanagi has leveled up!

Yosuke Hanamura: I… I…

Teddie: Yosuke, are you okay!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-Yeah… What… happened…? (to the shadow self) You… You’re… not me…

Teddie: That thing came from you, Yosuke… You have to admit it… or it’ll go berserk again…

> Yosuke seems reluctant to accept it…

”You're still yourself.” ✔
”You have to be brave.”
”Everyone’s the same inside.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Myself… Dammit… It hurts to face yourself… I knew it wasn’t lying… But I was so ashamed that I didn’t want to admit it… You’re me… and I’m you. When you get down to it, all of this is me.

> The strength of heart required to face oneself has been made manifest… 

[Yosuke’s shadow tuns into something else.]

> Yosuke has faced his other self… He has obtained the facade used to overcome life’s hardships, the Persona Jiraiya!

Yosuke Hanamura: This is my Persona… When we heard Senpai's voice… I wonder if that was something Senpai had been keeping deep down inside… Haha… ”He was a real pain in the ass,” huh? What a way to find out… Geez, this is so embarrassing… If you weren’t here, I don’t know what woulda happened… Thanks, Yu. Hey, Teddie… Could Senpai have been attacked by her other self here? Like how it just happened to me?

Teddie: I think so. The Shadows here were originally born from humans. Sometimes the fog clears. Then they all go berserk… And you saw what happens next. A strong-willed Shadow draws others to it. And the big mass of Shadows kills the host.

Yosuke Hanamura: So that’s why people die when it gets foggy in our world…

Teddie: Yosuke’s pretty worn out… This world isn’t made for humans. It’s not comfortable for you here. I don’t hear any more voices. I think we’re done with this place. Let’s go back.

[The team returns to the entrance to the TV World.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, Teddie. You said that this place is reality for people who enter, right? So that shopping district, and the weird room we saw before… Did they exist because the ones who died entered this world, and it became their reality? I guess what I’m trying to ask is… Did those places form because of the people who entered this world?

Teddie: I don’t know. It’s never happened before… But that’s probably where they were when the Shadows attacked them.

”It was the same for them?” ✔
”This world killed them?”
”……”

Teddie: The fog does lift here sometimes. The Shadows get really violent then. I always get so scared. I have to hide when it happens. …I sensed people here twice before. But both of them disappeared after the fog lifted…

Yosuke Hanamura: So let’s get this straight… Senpai and that Yamano lady were thrown in here, and since they couldn’t get out, they wandered around… After a while, that Shadow thing came out of them. The fog cleared, it went berserk, and it ended up killing them… Does that sound right? So if I’d been here until the fog cleared, I woulda been in much deeper trouble?

Teddie: Yeah, I’m pretty sure. You were lucky. Sensei and me were here with you…

Yosuke Hanamura: Dammit…! Senpai and that announcer… They were stuck here all alone… No one could save them…

Teddie: Yosuke… They disappeared when the fog lifted. But they were safe before that. No Shadows attacked them. They attacked us, though… Maybe they’re keeping a close eye on us. They might see people who investigate this place as enemies… It’ll be dangerous, but we might be able to fight them! We might save people!

Yosuke Hanamura: Are you saying, if anyone else gets thrown in here, we can save them before they disappear!? Like how you guys just saved me!?

”That seems to be the case.”
”We need to find the culprit.”
”We won't know unless we try.” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Anyways… We need to catch the one who’s throwing people in here and make him stop. Yeah… I’m finally starting to understand what’s going on.

Teddie: U-Um… Can I ask something too…? If Shadows are born from humans, what was Teddie born from?

Yosuke Hanamura: You don’t even know where you came from? How should we know?

Teddie: I know some things. Mostly about this world… But I don’t know anything about myself. To be honest, I never thought about it until now…

Yosuke Hanamura: Are you serious…? No wonder we couldn’t get a straight answer out of you…

Teddie: Will you guys… come back here…?

”Of course.”
”We made a promise?”
”We have no choice.” ✔

Teddie: Then… Will you keep your promise?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, you’re the one who said you weren’t letting us out unless we do.

Teddie: Oh! Th-That’s right! Okay, I’ll let you out. But there’s one thing. I’ll be waiting for you guys here. You need to come in from the same place every time. So we can meet up.

”From the same place…?”
”The TV at Junes…?” ✔

Teddie: You could come in from somewhere else. But then you won’t end up here. You might show up somewhere I couldn’t get to you. Then you’d be doooomed… Got it!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, pretty much… Alright, can you show us the way out?

Teddie: Roger that! One exit comin’ right up!

[He knocks on air and the 3 TV sets appears.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Cool… First we need to make sure there aren’t any employees milling around out there…

Teddie: Okay! Go go go! Squiiiish!

[He pushes them out.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Argh! Hey! Stop squeezing, you little-- Whoa!

[They land on Chie on the other side.]

Chie Satonaka: Ah! Y-You guys came baaack…!

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Chie? Whoa, what’s with that face?

Chie Satonaka: (hits Yosuke with the rope) The nerve of you guys! You are such morons! I can’t believe this! You guys suck! The rope got cut off… I had no idea what to do… I was so worried… I mean scared stiff, dammit! I hate you both!

Yosuke Hanamura: I… I think that mighta kinda sorta been our fault. Maybe we did go a little too far… Let’s apologize to her tomorrow. I’m completely wiped out… I’m gonna go home, soak in the shower for a while, and get some sleep. I think… I’m gonna sleep well tonight. Hehe… Well, see you in the morning!

> Near the flood plain while walking home from Junes…

[You meet Yukiko dressed in classic Japanese outfit - kimono.]

Yukiko Amagi: Hm? Oh… Are you surprised to see me dressed this way? My parents sent me out on an errand… Um… Are you getting used to your new town and school?

”Somewhat.” ✔
”Not really.”
”I like it here.”

Yukiko Amagi: …I'm glad to hear that. It must be difficult, moving to a place you know nothing about. I’ve never been out of Inaba, so I wouldn’t know what it’s like to transfer to a new school… Oh! Are you getting along with Chie? I mean, I always leave early, so… Umm…

”We're getting along.” ✔
”She's a real handful.”
”I don't know yet.”

Yukiko Amagi: I’m glad to her that. Chie’s very supportive, you know. It’s always her who gives me the little extra push I need. We had homeroom together last year too, and I still remember how we’d cut class sometimes. Oh… I should get going. I need to make tomorrow’s arrangements with our head chef. Our inn can’t function without me right now. Um… I’ll see you at school, then.

[Evening. You get back home and eat with Nanako while watching TV news.]

Nanako Dojima: Dad’s late…

Announcer: Our next story is an update in our ongoing report on the bizarre murders occurring in Inaba. At around 7:00 A.M., local high school student Saki Konishi was found dead in Inaba’s residential area. Since the body was positioned similarly to the last victim, and since Ms. Konishi was the one who discovered that body… Police are proceeding under the assumption that this may be a serial murder case related to the death of Mayumi Yamano. The coroner’s report has established Ms. Konishi’s time of death at around 1:00 A.M. last night. The body went unnoticed until this morning as a result of the heavy fog blanketing the area.

Nanako Dojima: Another incident… Dad won’t be coming home tonight.

”It can't be helped.”
”Are you worried about him?”
”I'll be here with you.” ✔

Nanako Dojima: …I’ll be okay. Can you help me do some stuff around the house?

> Nanako seems to be very reliable for her age.

Narrator: …Amagi Inn, located upstream of Samegawa River, is the town’s oldest historical landmark. Vacationers are known to travel surprising distances in order to visit its open-air, radium-rich hot springs.

Reporter: After the incident with Ms. Yamano, the manager has stepped aside, leaving her daughter Yukiko to fill her shoes.

> Yukiko is on TV, wearing a kimono.

Reporter: In other words, she’s a manager who’s still in high school. Now that has a nice ring to it… Let’s see if we can interview her. Excuse me!

Yukiko Amagi: Hm…? Um… Are you speaking to me?

Reporter: We’ve heard that you’re the new manager. Is it true you’re still in high school?

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, well, I’m only filling in temporarily…

Reporter: Someday, though… That aside, wow! You’re looking gorgeous in that kimono. You must have had a lot of male visitors.

Yukiko Amagi: Huh? No, um…

> The reporter’s rambling goes further and further off subject…

Nanako Dojima: …This is boring. Oh, I need to do the dishes…

> You decided to help out with the housework.

CHAPTER 5: Lacey Unmentionables
[After helping Nanako you get to your room.]

> It's raining tonight. Something may appear on TV. You should go back to your room and check the TV… Will something appear on TV…?

[You turn on your TV…]

Weather announcer: In other Inaba-related news, meteorologists are predicting heavy fog throughout the year. The region has seen an abnormal amount of fog over the past few years, and the cause of the climate change is unknown. Whatever the reason, residents of the Inaba area should be extra careful. Our broadcast tonight was extended to bring you up-to-date news on the incident in Inaba. The time is now midnight.

[You turn off the TV. Something appear on the screen…]

> …The image is there again. It seems that if the conditions are met, you can see it as many times as you want… …A silhouette appeared! It seems to be a woman. It looks like she’s wearing a kimono… The image is so out of focus that you can't tell who it is… 

> What would happen if you touched the image on the Midnight Channel…? Would you be able to touch the person on screen…?

[You touch the screen and your arm sucks in to the TV World.]

> The image disappeared… You should speak to Yosuke and the others about this tomorrow. You decide to go to bed for tonight. 

[You go to sleep and teleport to the limo… the Velvet Room.]

> This is…

Igor: Welcome. Do be alarmed. You are fast asleep in the real world… I have summoned you within your dreams.

> It seems you’ve been summoned to the Velvet Room…

Igor: And so we meet again.

Margaret: This is a space that only those who have, in one way or another, entered into a contract may enter… In your daily life, you subconsciously heard the call to awaken, and you chose to follow the destiny of your inner voice… …thereby enacting your glorious awakening to your power.

Igor: Hold on to this…

> Obtained Velvet Key.

Igor: From this night forth, you are our guest in this Velvet Room. Your destiny will require you to hone power, and for that, you will inevitably require our help. There is but one price for this assistance… You must abide by your contract and assume responsibility for all decisions you may make.

”I understand.”
”I don't get it.” ✔

Igor: …That is fine, for now. The Persona you have acquired… It is a side of you that shows itself when you face the world around you. Perhaps you can think of it as… a facade of determination you wear to face various difficulties in life. Your Persona ability, however, is that of the wild card… Compared to that of others, it is very special. It is like the number zero… empty, yet holding infinite potential within itself.

”Special…?” ✔
”Empty…?”

Igor: The Persona ability is the power to control one’s own heart… And the heart is strengthened through bonds. As you form bonds by becoming involved with others, your own Social Links will gradually develop. The power of these Social Links is what will determine your Persona's abilities.

”Control one's heart…?”
”I still don't get it.” ✔

Margaret: Social Links are necessary for more than strengthening your Persona. At times, they will help light the way to the truth you are searching for.

Igor: Where will your awakened power of the wild card take you…? I look forward to traveling the road of your destiny together… *chuckle* ‘Til we meet again…

April 16th, 2011. Saturday.
Yosuke Hanamura: Yo! You saw what was on last night, right? I couldn’t tell who it was, but if someone’s shown up on TV, we can’t ignore it. Let’s go check it out after school. Maybe Teddie can tell us something. If it turns out someone was thrown in again, there really might be a culprit behind all this. Even if it is something about that place that’s killing the victims… If someone’s using that world as a weapon, that’s unforgivable. We need to find the culprit… no matter what it takes! There’s no way the police can do it… Who’d believe that the murderer kills people by throwing them into the TV?

”It has to be us.”
”I want to keep my word too.”
”Let's bring an end to this.” ✔
”You do it.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah… I agree. You know, I tried stickin’ my head in the TV last night, the way you did, and it actually worked. I think I can do that now because I have the same power… Persona, wasn’t it? Could be that we got this sift from someone specifically so we could solve the case. Then again, you managed to go inside the TV and get you Persona first… I feel like, as long as you’re with me, I can find the culprit and crack this case. …Well, let’s do our best!

> Even with so much mystery swirling around, Yosuke is trying his hardest to move on… You sense a faint stirring of friendship between you and Yosuke…

Thou art I… And I am thou…
Thou hast established a new bond…
It brings thee closer to the truth…
Thou shalt be blessed when creating Personas of the Magician Arcana…

> As you form a bond with Yosuke, feel the power in your heart strengthening… …You recall Igor's words.

Igor: ”The Persona ability is the power to control one’s own heart… And the heart is strengthened through bonds. As you form bands by becoming involved with others, your own Social Links will gradually develop. The power of these Social Links is what will determine you Persona’s abilities.”

> Social Links… Is this bond with Yosuke what Igor was talking about…? You have established the Yosuke Hanamura Social Link of the Magician Arcana! Yosuke’s determination in battle has been enhanced… Yosuke can now wake up a knocked-down ally during battle!

[After classes Chie rushes in!]

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh… Chie! Um… About yesterday… We’re sorry we worried you…

Chie Satonaka: Never mind that. Is Yukiko still not here?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Y-Yukiko-san? Uh… no…? At least, I haven’t seen be today.

Chie Satonaka: Oh man… What should I do…? Hey, is that stuff you were talking about for real? You know… All that about how people showing up on the Midnight Channel is related to that other world.

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, we were just talking about that. We’re thinking of checking it out later--

Chie Satonaka: The person on TV yesterday… I think it was Yukiko. That kimono looked like the one she wears at the inn, and she wore it during that interview a few days too. I got worried, so I emailed her last night, but she hasn’t responded… I called her earlier in the evening though, and she said she’d be at school today… I…

Yosuke Hanamura: Calm down. We get the picture. And you still haven’t heard from her?

Chie Satonaka: No…

> You summed the information you gained in that other world for Chie.

Chie Satonaka: What’s that supposed to mean…? Wait, are you saying… Yukiko was thrown in there!?

Yosuke Hanamura: We don’t know yet for sure. We should check to see if she’s safe first.

Chie Satonaka: No good… Her voicemail picked up… S-She’s not answering…

Yosuke Hanamura: Are you serious…? Then is Yukiko-san inside that place…?

Chie Satonaka: S-Stop it! Something must’ve come us, like an errand or something… Oh, or she might be helping at the inn… She wouldn’t be able to answer her cell if that’s it…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, but would she skip school for that?

Chie Satonaka: W-Well, I’ll give the inn a call… Umm… I’ve got the rather here somewhere… C’mon, Yukiko… Pick up… Oh, is this Yukiko!? Thank god, she’s there! Ah, uh. I see… Nah, it was nothing, haha. I’ll email you again later… *sigh* She was over at the inn. She said they had a big group reservation, and she had to help out. Yeah… Now that I think about it, this has happened before, too. At least once a year. She said she’ll be at the inn tomorrow, too. Oh, for crying out loud, Yosuke! You got me worried over nothing! She was totally fine! And you were all, ”Is Yukiko-san inside that place…?” Hmph…

Yosuke Hanamura: Sorry… But there is a reason we thought that.

Chie Satonaka: Oh yeah…? What?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well… we thought people show in on the Midnight Channel because they’re already over in that world. I mean, it makes sense, right? People show up on TV because they’re inside the TV… But Yukiko-san’s still here, in that world. We might want to see what this is about. Alright, let’s meet to at Junes after school.

[After school the team meet up at Junes food court.]

> You explained to Chie in detail again about what happened last night.

Yosuke Hanamura: O-Okay, I think that’s more than enough about my sorry escapades.

Chie Satonaka: If I hadn’t seen the place first hand… I’d never have believed a story like that.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, no kidding. Anyways, we need to know what’s going on inside--

Chie Satonaka: How? By talking to that Teddie guy?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah. Too bad there’s so many customers around… I forgot there’s a sale in the electronics department today… I got it! C’mere a sec. Try sticking your hand in and calling him over. I bet that bear’s wandering around the entrance anyway. Hey Chie, stand over here. Make a wall with me.

Chie Satonaka: A wall?

> You tried beckoning Teddie over… Something bit you!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What’s wrong!?

Chie Satonaka: Shhh! Not so loud, you idiot! D-Dude, is that a bite mark!? Are you okay!?

”I'm fine.”
”I'll be all right.”
”I think I'm cry…” ✔

Chie Satonaka: Ohh, c’mon, don’t cry… Shesh, that stupid bear must’ve done it… (quietly) Hey, you! We know you're in there!

Teddie: Ooh ooh, is this a game?

Yosuke Hanamura: No, it’s not a game! Can you sense anyone inside there right now?

Teddie: Who’s ”anyone”? I’m a lonely little bear like always. This land feels so bear-ren…

Chie Satonaka: (quietly) Shut it! So there’s no one inside…? You’re sure?

Teddie: I-I’m not lying! My nose is running as good as ever!

Chie Satonaka: I’m gonna go warn Yukiko anyway. Since she’ll be busy this weekend helping out at the inn, I doubt she’d go anywhere alone, but still…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah… You'll walk with her to school on Monday, right?

Chie Satonaka: Sure, I’ll go pick her up at her house.

Yosuke Hanamura: Maybe we’ll find out more on tonight’s Midnight Channel. Cross your fingers that this is all just a misunderstanding… What’s your cell number? I’ll call you when I watch it tonight.

> You exchanged cell numbers with Yosuke.

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright, don’t forget to watch tonight.

> Was it really Yukiko who appeared last night…? You need to watch the Midnight Channel again tonight…

[We jump to a crime scene. Dojima and a young policeman standing in a rain.]

Tohru Adachi: Looks like we’ve found all we’re gonna find here. And we still got nothing that points directly to a suspect…

Ryotaro Dojima: We don’t even know if this is a homicide.

Tohru Adachi: Well, what else could it be? There’s no way a body could end to like that by accident!

Ryotaro Dojima: …I know. We haven't found the cause of death for the first vic, and now we've got a second one just like it… If this is a murder case, there’s no doubt we’re dealing with a single perp. But if that’s true… what the hell is going on?

Tohru Adachi: You know, I thought at first this all spun out of that love triangle.
Ryotaro Dojima: No. That singer--Misuzu Hiiragi has a solid alibi. She was performing overseas, and her phone records prove it. And remember, the only reason the scandal went public was because Hiiragi herself broke it to the media. No one would put themselves under suspicion that way if they had murder on their mind.

Tohru Adachi: Got a point there…

Ryotaro Dojima: Same with Taro Namatame, her husband. No matter how much we shake him down, nothing links him to the murders. He's been working in the city for the past six months. Seems he was here recently because of the scandal, but he was swanned with work back home at the time of the incident. There are eyewitnesses and other evidence placing him at his office the night that Mayumi Yamano died. And we can’t find anything that shows Yamano making contact with Namatame before or after her disappearance…

Tohru Adachi: You hear Namatame’s career has also been killed stone dead? He’s been fired from his position as secretary. He's practically as much of a victim as the Yamano girl.

Ryotaro Dojima: Yeah, I agree… Then we have the second case, regarding Saki Konishi… She’s the one who discovered Yamano’s corpse… But I don’t buy the killer shutting her up as a possible motive. She was killed well after she reported the body, and the culprit didn’t hide her. It’s like they were meant to be found. The only other connection is that she attended the same school as the daughter of the inn where Yamano was holed up. But that hardly paints to a motive. Coincidences like that are common in a town as small as ours.

Tohru Adachi: Yeah… I heard about that angle on the news, too.

Ryotaro Dojima: What!? Is the story about the inn out already?

Tohru Adachi: Okay, I got it! How's this? Maybe there was something about the corpse that only Saki Konishi knew! And our perp killed her to keep whatever it was from leaking out!

Ryotaro Dojima: ……Either way, all we can do now is keep investigating anyone involved with the victims… Our perp… It has to be someone in Inaba.

Tohru Adachi: Ooh, is your detective's intuition at work?

[You get back home. Nanako watching TV quiz.]

Nanako Dojima: Hmm… This answer is hard…

> Nanako is absorbed in the quiz show. You should leave her alone… You should check the Midnight Channel tonight too… 

[You go up to your room on the second floor.]

>It’s raining tonight. Will something appear on TV…?

[An image appears on the turned off TV… It’s a news report?]

Yukiko in Pink Dress: Good evening! Tonight, princess Yukiko has a big surprise! I’m gonna go score myself a hot stud! Welcome to ”Not a dream, not a hoax” Princess Yukiko’s hunt for her prince charming! And I came prepared! (touches her crotch) I’ve got my lacy unmentionables on, stacked from top to bottom! I’m out to catch a whole harem, and the best of the lot is gonna be all mine! Well… here I go!

[She runs into her castle in the TV World.]

> That was definitely Yukiko on the Midnight Channel just now…

[Yosuke calls you.]

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hey, did you see that!? That was Yukiko-san for sure! It looked like her… I mean, she even said her name! But didn't the stuff she was saying sound weird!? And she looked like she was on some low-budget TV show… Was it like this before, too? What’s going on…?

”Calm down.”
”Try to contact Yukiko.” ✔
”Try to contact Chie.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-Yeah, I know. Uhhh… Crap, I don’t know her number… Oh yeah, I can just call Chie! Tomorrow’s Sunday, so let’s meet up at Junes first thing in the morning!

> You promised to meet up with Yosuke tomorrow. You decide to go to bed early tonight.

April 17th, 2011. Sunday.
[You wake up and go to the first floor.]

Nanako Dojima: Oh, good morning.

> It seems that only Nanako is here.

”Where's your father?” ✔
”You're up early today.”

Nanako Dojima: He left already. He said he’s gonna be late.

> If you leave, Nanako will be left all alone to look after the house… On the other hand, you have important business with Yosuke today…

Nanako Dojima: Are you going somewhere? I’ll be fine by myself. (turns on the TV)

Weather announcer: --so the weather this weekend will be perfect for going out. As for next week’s forecast…

Nanako Dojima: Oh, the sun’s gonna come out. I should do some laundry. Uh… weren’t you going somewhere?

> You decided to go out.

[Junes. Food court.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Sorry for the holdup. I found some stuff we can use in the closet at home. Take a look at these!

[He pulls out two swords!]

Yosuke Hanamura: We’ve got our Personas, but a golf club’s not that reliable of a weapon. So, which one strikes you fancy?

”The katana.” ✔
”The nata.”
”Neither.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Ahh, you’ve got discerning taste. This is a Junes exclusive. The blade's fake, though… As for me… Wait, maybe both would be good, too. (swings the swords) K-Kinda like this!? Or like this!? What about this!?

Patrolman: Two suspicious young males found, one armed with multiple weapons. Request intermediate backup.

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh…? Ohhh crap. I mean… No… No no no no, this isn’t what it looks like. We didn’t steal it… Uh, I guess that’s not what matters… A-Anyways, we’re not doing anything bad! We’re just two ordinary kids who like weapons and… Ugh, that doesn’t sound right either. Ahaha…

Patrolman: Put the weapons down now! We’ll listen to your story at the station. Hands where I can see them, too! I said now!

Yosuke Hanamura: B-But… This isn’t…

Patrolman: Are you resisting an officer of the law!? Y-You’re under arrest!

[Two more patrolmen appears.]

> You were taken to the police station with Yosuke as suspects…

Ryotaro Dojima: …You didn’t seem the type to pull a stupid stunt like this. You know what’s been some on around town. We got men stationed everywhere. For god’s sake… You’re lucky I was around, or this would have ended up on your permanent record.

Yosuke Hanamura: We’re sorry…

> Your weapons have been confiscated…

Plain clothes man: Wait, so the one that disappeared is the Amagi girl…?

Uniformed officer: Seems like it… But she’s Just a high schooler, you know. Could be that she decided to run away from home…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey… Did he say Amagi…? Then… She really is…

Ryotaro Dojima: Hm? Who’s what now?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, uh, nothing…

Ryotaro Dojima: I’m sure you’ve seen on the news that there’s an investigation in progress… We’re sensitive about certain things. You're free to go. But this better not happen again.

[He leaves. Adachi appears.]

Tohru Adachi: Whoa… Pardon me. Huh? Aren't you the kid staying at Dojima-san's place?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh…! Uh, can we ask you something? It's about Yukiko-san… I mean, Yukiko Amagi of the Amagi Inn… Did something happened to her?

Tohru Adachi: Huh? Oh, um… Am I allowed to say… ? Well, if you’re friends with Ms. Amagi… Keep this between us, okay? We got a call from Ms. Amagi’s parents yesterday evening sayin’ they couldn’t find her anywhere. Since it was the weekend, the workers at the inn were extremely busy, and no one saw Ms. Amagi around that time. Oh, but that doesn't necessarily mean this is a case just yet! But, people've been turning up dead on foggy days… So we're really sensitive to stuff like this. By the way, did she say anything to you guys about maybe going through some hard times?

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh…? Hard times?

Tohru Adachi: Well, that announcer, Ms. Yamano, was staying at the Amagi inn before the first murder. Seems Ms. Yamano had some harsh words for the manager about the staff’s attitude towards guests. The stress of it caused the manager to collapse. And with Ms. Amagi being the manager’s daughter… She must’ve felt pretty strongly about the incident, y’know. By the way, did Ms. Amagi hint that she might be leaving the house? ’Cause if not, there’s been some theories floating around that she’s laying low for some reason or another… …Crap, I think I’ve gone too far. You didn’t hear that, okay?

Ryotaro Dojima: (screaming) Adachi, what the hell are you chatting with civvies for!? And where’s my coffee!?

Tohru Adachi: S-Sorry! I got it right here! (to the team) Psst! Forget I said anything! Please!

[You and Yosuke go down to the reception desk.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey… Does that detective think that Yukiko-san--

Chie Satonaka: There you are! Sheesh, what’re you guys doing!? I’ve been looking everywhere!

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh, well, there was a slight misunderstanding… We’ll tell you about it later. Anyways, something’s up with Yukiko-san!

Chie Satonaka: Huh? You know already!? I kept calling her cell, but she didn’t pick up… So I went to her house, and it turns out Yukiko really did disappear…!

Yosuke Hanamura: I guess we’ve got no choice but to go now… But that aside, the cops are saying some weird stuff. They think Yukiko-san’s hiding to ”lay low”… Apparently Yukiko-san’s mom collapsed because that announcer lady bitched her out. They think that gives her a motive, and the fact that the mar died right after makes her even more suspicious…

Chie Satonaka: (screams in rage) What!? They think Yukiko did it!? What the hell is wrong with them!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude, don’t snap at me! Yukiko’s the victim here, dammit, not the suspect…

> They both seem agitated…

”Look, we need to save her.”
”Let's all calm down.” ✔

Chie Satonaka: Y-You're right. So… what're we gonna do!?

Yosuke Hanamura: With the police totally on the wrong track, we’ve gotta handle it ourselves.

Chie Satonaka: I’m going too! And that's final! I'm going to save Yukiko no matter what!

Yosuke Hanamura: Are you gonna be all right? But man… They just confiscated our weapons. We can’t go in empty-handed…

Chie Satonaka: Weapons…? I know just the place! C’mon, follow me!

[They go to a blacksmith at the Shopping District.]

Chie Satonaka: Here we are!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What kinda shop is this…?

Chie Satonaka: A metalworks… I guess? They sell all sorts of metal crap… like katanas and stuff.

Yosuke Hanamura: Doesn’t that seem weird to you!? Why would you know about a place like this anyway? Oh, I get it… You watched one to many kung-fu movies, and…

Chie Satonaka: It's not that at all! I overheard some guys in our class talk about it. They said this place sells weapons and armor. Here, this one looks good. But it might be too heavy…

Yosuke Hanamura: I dunno, Chie… I still think it’s too dangerous. I know how you feel, but--

Chie Satonaka: You don’t! You don't know shit about how I feel… Yukiko might die from this, for crying out loud! I'm going, and that's that!

”Oh, alright.”
” You really shouldn't do this.”
”Okay, but stay behind us…” ✔

Chie Satonaka: Psh, I'll be fine! My reflexes are second to none!

Yosuke Hanamura: Listen… I’m not kidding around. You don’t know what it’s like in there! If you’re not gonna listen to our warnings, we’re leaving you here! If you insist on coming, just make sure you have something to protect yourself.

Chie Satonaka: Alright…

Yosuke Hanamura: But man, what should we get…? Hey, Yu. Mind picking out something for me, too?  You’re our main asset in battle right now, so I think you should choose whatever makes it easiest for you.

> Received 5000 yen from Yosuke. (about $44)

Chie Satonaka: I got my stuff all picked out! How about you guys?

Yosuke Hanamura: You know… if we wear this stuff around town, we’ll just get picked up again. But it’s not like we can waltz into Junes with a sack full of sear and expect no one to notice, either…

Chie Satonaka: Why not conceal them under our uniforms? I don't think people would notice.

Yosuke Hanamura: Okay… Let’s try that. Alright, let's split up and get ready. The store’ll be crowded until the afternoon sale ends, and if we walk around together, the cops might get suspicious.

Chie Satonaka: Then I'll see you guys at the Junes food court!

[You talk to the smith, Old Man Daidara.]

Old Man Daidara: Have you come to see my art? Please, look around. Take you time.

[You buy some weapons and leave the store.]

> There’s a bizarre door before you… It seems the others can’t see the door…

Voice in your head: So it finally begins… Now, if you’ll give me a moment of your time…

> The Velvet Key in your pocket is shining…

[You enter the door and find yourself in the limo, the Velvet Room.]

Igor: We have been expecting you. The catastrophe that is headed your way… It has already taken human lives in its approach towards you… But you have nothing to fear. You already have the power to fight against it. It seems that the time for you to use your Persona has come… *chuckle*

Margaret: Your Persona ability is that of the wild card. If you strengthen your bonds properly, their power will help you overcome any ordeal. Our role is to facilitate that.

Igor: My contribution… is to give birth to new Personas. By mixing together multiple Persona cards, I can transmute them into a new form… This, in other words, is the fusion of Personas. You have the power to hold multiple Personas and to use them accordingly. When you defeat an enemy, the seeds of possibility you attain will appear before you as cards. At times, they may be hard to grasp… but you must master your fear and reach out to them. When you obtain new cards, please do not hesitate to bring them here. If you have been developing your Social Links, then your Persona will gain even more power… They will be one of your chief sources of strength… You would do well to take this to heart.

> You recall that you have the Magician Social Link with Yosuke… 

> It seems that when a Persona of the Magician Arcana is fused, that Persona will gain even more power…

Margaret: The tome you see in my hand is the Persona Compendium. Registering the Personas you hold will allow you to recall them at any time. Please see me when you wish to use it. Oh, and one more thing… I would like to introduce a new resident of the Velvet Room, who will be helping you on your journey.

Unfriendly-looking girl: ……

Margaret: …Marie?

Marie: Yeah, I can hear. Nice to meet you.

> The girl seems unfriendly… You feel that you've met her somewhere before…

”I've met you somewhere…”
”Why are here?” ✔
”……”

Marie: …Dunno. It doesn't matter.

Margaret: Excuse her. This is Marie. Her soul is still very young and--

Marie: Shut up! Don't tell him any more about me than you need to.

Margaret: …As you can see. She may be brusque at times, but please understand that she is only an apprentice and forgive her for her impoliteness.

”Got it.” ✔
”I guess.”

Margaret: Marie will be dealing with ”Skill Cards.” Using these cards will allow you to provide your Personas with new powers. Also, I am sure she will help you form a bond between yourself and the ”outside world.” Marie will contact you at a later date. Please feel free to speak with her here when you wish to use her services.

Igor: *chuckle* Do you recall my words to you before? ”The coming year is a turning point in your destiny… If the mystery goes unsolved, your future may be forever lost.” I meant precisely what I said. Defeat in battle is not the only way your journey may come to an end… Please do not forget this. When next we meet, you will come here of your own will. *chuckle* I look forward to it. Until then… farewell.

> You remember that you’re supposed to meet the others at the James food court.

[You go to Junes.]

Yosuke Hanamura: We really stick out… Guess it doesn’t help that we’re in our school uniforms on a Sunday. The sale should end soon, so that’ll get rid of some of the people wandering around here. Alright… let’s get going. Chie, it's not too late to--

Chie Satonaka: I'm going!

Yosuke Hanamura: Fine, but don't push yourself, got it!?

[The team enters the TV World.]

Chie Satonaka: Whoa, it really is that bear from last time…

Teddie: I've been deli-bear-ating over it for a long time now. Hey, that wasn’t a bad joke. Heehee…!

Yosuke Hanamura: So… did you figure anything out? Eh, it’s probably useless to think about it too much. I’ve seen the inside of your skull, and it was empty.

Teddie: How rude! You’re right, though. I try and try but nothing comes out of my head.

Chie Satonaka: Will you guys shut up!? Now’s not the time for stupid jokes! Listen… Someone came here yesterday, right?

Teddie: Wow! There’s a girl with a better nose than me!? What’s your name, Miss?

Chie Satonaka: M-Miss? Uh… I’m Chie. But never mind that! Tell me more about that ”someone”!

Teddie: I think it happened a little after I talked with you guys. After that, it felt like someone was here.

Yosuke Hanamura: Is it Yukiko-san!?

Teddie: I don’t know. I haven’t looked… The presence is over that way. That’s probably where they are.

Chie Satonaka: Over there, huh? Is everyone ready?

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-Yeah!

[The team runs to the evil looking castle.]

Chie Satonaka: What the…? A castle!? Y’think this is the place they showed on TV last time?

Yosuke Hanamura: You’re positive that no one’s behind a camera for that bizarre midnight program?

Teddie: Program…? I don’t know. Maybe people on your side can see stuff in this world. It might be that. I dunno… And I told you before! There's only me and Shadows here! There's ”camera” stuff going on. This world has been like this from the beginning.

Yosuke Hanamura: ”From the beginning”…? That's what we don't understand!

Teddie: I dunno… Can you guys explain everything about your world? I’ve never seen this ”program” thingy before. So I don’t know.

Chie Satonaka: Well… is that really what's happening? Are we really looking into this world? Because the first time Yukiko showed up on that Channel was before she disappeared. Doesn’t that seem off? I mean, Yukiko saying stuff like ”score myself a hot stud”? That’s not like her at all!

Teddie: ”Score”? ”Stud”…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, I couldn’t believe it either… Yukiko-san would never say anything like that. I wonder… Is this kinda like what happened to me last time…?

Teddie: There’s a lot of stuff I still don’t get. But after hearing your story… I think that ”program” happens because of the person who appears on it. Or something like that…

Chie Satonaka: So… Yukiko is producing that show herself? Ugh, I don't get this at all! Hey… Do you feel Yukiko’s presence from inside?

Teddie: I’m pretty sure. So, um, what's this ”scoring with a hot stud” thing…?

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko's here… I'm going on ahead!

[She runs to the castle.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, wait! Don't go alone! Geez! We better follow her! Tch… She ran off on her own…

Teddie: Urk…! There are lots of Shadows in the castle. It’ll be dangerous inside for a girl by herself…

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude, are you serious!? Why didn't tell us before!? C'mon, let's find Chie!

CHAPTER 6: Shadow Chie
Teddie: That girl ran off on her own… That’s kinda dangerous! We should catch a to her quick, Sensei!

> Obtained Revival Bead x3.

Teddie: I gathered all of these myself. I’ll give them to you, Sensei.

> Obtained Peach Seed x5 and Drop x5.

Yosuke Hanamura: This is bad, Yu! We better hurry after Chie!

[You and Yosuke enter Yukiko’s Castle.]

Teddie: She hasn’t gone that far yet.

Yosuke Hanamura: Ugh, she ran off all alone… Dammit, let's go!

Teddie: Um, wait a second! The Shadows have gotten aggravated ever since you two got here. They’ll probably attack as soon as they find you, Sensei. So try to get the jump on Shadows before they can attack you!

[The team defeats the first enemy.]

> You see mysterious cards before your eyes…

> You recalled what Igor told you…

Igor: ”When you defeat an enemy, the seeds of possibility you attain will appear before you as cards. At times, they may be hard to grasp… but you must master your fear and reach out to them.”

[You win some bonus cards and the team continue exploring the castle. At the second floor…]

Teddie: Hmm… You’re good at fighting, Sensei. Compared to you, Yosuke stinks…

Yosuke Hanamura: Shut up, Ted! Though I do gotta admit… You have a knack for this stuff.

Teddie: Doesn’t he? So you should be the one to give Yosuke orders during a fight.

Yosuke Hanamura: It ticks me off to hear Teddie say that stuff, but I don’t wanna cause trouble doing my own thing in battle… So don’t hesitate to order me around. I’m counting on you.

[The team approach a door.]

Teddie: There she is!

[The team enters and find Chie just standing in the middle of it.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Chie! Are you all right!? Chie…?

Yukiko’s voice: She said that red looks good on me…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yukiko-san!?

Yukiko’s voice: I hated my name… Yukiko… ”Snow”… Snow is cold and it melts quickly… It’s transient… worthless… But it’s perfect for me… Apart from inheriting the inn, I’m worthless… Still… Chie told me that red looks good on me.

Yosuke Hanamura: Are these… Yukiko-san’s inner thoughts? I remember hearing Saki-senpai’s, too…

Teddie: Yeah. This castle is probably here because of this Yukiko person.

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko…

Yukiko’s voice: Chie was the only one who save my life meaning… She’s bright and strong, and she can do anything… She has everything that I don’t… Compared to Chie, I’m… I’m… Chie protects me… She looks after my worthless life… And I… I don’t deserve am of it… Chie is so kind…

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko, I-I…

Chie-like voice: ”Chie is so kind,” huh? What a joke.

Chie Satonaka: Wh-What…!?

[Shadow Chie appears.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh man… Is that…!?

Teddie: It's just like Yosuke! She lost control over her messed self! Now it’s a Shadow!

Other Chie: Are we talking about THAT Yukiko!? She says I’m protecting her!? She says she's worthless! *chuckle* That’s how it should be, right?

Chie Satonaka: Wh-What’re you saying?

Other Chie: Yukiko’s sooo good looking… sooo fair-skinned… sooo feminine… She’s the one all the guys drool over. When Yukiko looked at me with such jealousy… Man, did I get a charge out of that. Yukiko knows the score. She can’t do anything if I’m not around… I'm better than her… Much, much better!

Chie Satonaka: No! I have never thought that!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What’re we gonna do?

”We need to protect Chie.” ✔
”I don't know.”
”……”

Teddie: We need to protect Chie-chan right now!

Chie Satonaka: N-No, don’t come near me! Don’t look at me!

Yosuke Hanamura: Chie, calm down!

Chie Satonaka: No… No, this isn’t me!

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Wait, stupid! Don’t say anything else like that!

Other Chie: *chuckle* That’s right. I’m the one who can’t do anything alone… I can’t win as a girl, let alone as a person… I’m pathetic. But Yukiko… She depends on me… *chuckle* That’s why she’s my friend… I’ll never loosen my grip on her… She’s too important to me.

Chie Satonaka: No… That is not how I think of her…

Other Chie: *chuckle* So, you’re just gonna tun your back and deny me again? But things are different now. When the time comes… I’ll be the die left standing. You won’t mind, right? I’m still you!

Chie Satonaka: Shut up! You’re…

Yosuke Hanamura: Chie, no!

Chie Satonaka: (screaming) You’re not me!

Other Chie: *chuckle* Heehee… Ahahahahahaha!

[Chie’s shadow tuns into a monster.]

Chie Satonaka: Aaagh!

Yosuke Hanamura: Chie!

Teddie: I-It’s coming! You have to use your powers to save Chie-chan!

[The fight begins.]

Shadow Chie: I am a shadow… The true self… What do you guys think you’re doing? Trying to defend the ”real” me? Then you’re gonna pay the price!

Yosuke Hanamura: Shut up! Quit being such a pain! Chie… Just hang in there a little longer…

Shadow Chie: Hah… Think you can stop me that easy!?

[The team hits Shadow Chie a couple of time… with their katanas.]

Shadow Chie: Looks like you won’t understand without a little pain! Ahahaha, how lame! You’re all so deadly serious, and we’ve only gotten started! Are you guys idiots!? Why are you protecting her like that? She’s nothing but a grubby bitch! Ngh… Don’t make fun of me… You’re… You’re nothing against me…!

[The team wins the fight!]

Chie Satonaka: Ngh…

Yosuke Hanamura: Chie! Are you okay!?

Chie Satonaka: What happened…? (to her shadow) What’s the matter…? Got nothing to say anymore?

Yosuke Hanamura: Stop it, Chie. It's all right.

Chie Satonaka: B-But…

”You're more than that thing.” ✔
”Everyone has different faces. ”
”We understand. ”

Chie Satonaka: B-But I…

Yosuke Hanamura: He’s right… I went through the same thing. So I can understand… I mean Everyone has a side like this…

Chie Satonaka: (to her shadow) Yeah… I kinda get it now. You are me… A side of me I couldn’t forgive… That I tried to ignore… But you still exist. You’re a part of me…

> The strength of heart required to face oneself has been made manifest… Chie has faced her other self… She has obtained the facade used to overcome life’s hardships, the Persona Tomoe!

Chie Satonaka: I… Um, it’s true that part of me feels that way… But I wasn’t lying about being friends with Yukiko…!

Yosuke Hanamura: Like we didn’t know that already.

[Chie falls on her kneels.]

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hey! Chie!

Chie Satonaka: I’m okay… Just a little tired…

Yosuke Hanamura: You don’t look okay at all… And I bet… You can use the same power we have now.

Chie Satonaka: Huh…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, what should we do?

”Let's go back.”
”Let's take a break.” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: All right. Let’s get back to the entrance, though. It’s dangerous around here.

Chie Satonaka: I-I never said I needed a break! I… can still keep going…

Teddie: Don’t overdo it!

Yosuke Hanamura: It’s not that we don’t think you can. It’s just, we have to save Yukiko-san, no matter what. Now that you have the power, you can fight with us. It’d be much better for us all if you had your strength back. That’s why we’re saying we should go back and regroup.

Chie Satonaka: But Yukiko’s still in here, isn’t she!? I-I… If those were Yukiko’s true feelings… then I have to tell her something. I’m not as strong as she thinks! It’s because she was with me… Because we were always together, I was able to act that way. If we weren’t, I’d…

Teddie: Well, you need to get your strength back! Then you can tell her! Yuki-chan’s normal. The Shadows don’t attack normal people. They only attack when the fog lifts here.

Yosuke Hanamura: So Yukiko-san will be safe until then, right?

Teddie: I'm positive.

Chie Satonaka: Why…? I don't get it…

Yosuke Hanamura: Teddie told us that the weather here is the opposite of our own world. When it fogs over in our world… That’s the day it lifts here, and that’s when the Shadows attack their victim. So even if we leave for a while, Yukiko-san won’t be in danger until the fog starts to cover Inaba. I’m sure of it. It was the same way for that announcer and Senpai… Don’t you remember how it was foggy in town on the days they died?

Chie Satonaka: You mean… they were killed by their other selves?

Yosuke Hanamura: The fog usually appears after it rains. But it’s been sunny lately. I don’t think it’s going to rain anytime soon. Don’t worry so much. We’ll check the weather forecast first thing when we get back.

Chie Satonaka: But… But I can’t turn back now! We’ve come so far! Yukiko’s still here! She’s all alone… She must be so scared!

Yosuke Hanamura: Then you tell me how much further we gotta go to reach Yukiko-san!

Chie Satonaka: Th-That's…!

Yosuke Hanamura: You don’t know what’s a ahead. The enemies might be even stronger. If we push ourselves too hard and set wiped out, who’ll save Yukiko-san then!? We can’t fail, no matter what… Am I wrong?

Chie Satonaka: …….Alright. I shouldn’t have rushed in like that by myself…

”No worries.
”Let’s go together next time.” ✔
”I know how you feel.”

Yosuke Hanamura: No worries. We’re definitely gonna save Yukiko-san… Right?

Chie Satonaka: …Right!

[The team walk to the entrance to the TV World.]

Chie Satonaka: I… I’m feeling even worse than the last time I came in here… My head feels like it’s gonna split open… Are you guys okay?

”We’re totally okay.”
”Why just Chie…?”
”It’s thanks to these.” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s right, you’re not wearing the glasses.

Chie Satonaka: Oh yeah… What’s with those glasses? Did your eyesight go bad?

Yosuke Hanamura: Man… You didn’t notice until now? How panicked were you…?

Teddie: Tum de dumm! I got a pair ready for Chie-chan, too. Here you go!

Chie Satonaka: Whoa! What the--I? This is awesome! It’s like the fog doesn’t exist!

Yosuke Hanamura: Why didn’t you whip those out earlier if you had them?

Teddie: I made them right now! You didn’t tell me she was coming! It was all so sadden! I mean, sudden!

Chie Satonaka: Huh… so that’s the trick. I was wondering how you guys could see where you were going. Hey, is it alright if I keep these?

Teddie: Fo’ sho!

Chie Satonaka: We’ll have to stop here today… But I’ll be back with these pupies! You guys better not come here without me, got it!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, let’s all promise each other… Nobody goes in alone. It’s way too dangerous. If we don’t work together, we won’t be able to solve this case or save Yukiko-san… right?

”You're right.” ✔
”I disagree.”

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, I agree. I promise too.

”Let's save Yukiko!” ✔
”Let's solve the case.”
”This'll be a breeze for us.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright, so from tomorrow on, we’ll try and come here as much as we can after school… And that includes days off. Hey… Would you mind being our leader? You were the first to get this power, and you’re way better in a fight than either of us. I think it’s best for all of us if you set the pace of the investigation, and we follow your lead. I’m cool playing second banana.

”Leave it to me.” ✔
”Ehh… sure, why not.”
”No.”

Yosuke Hanamura: I had a feeling you’d say that. I mean, I’m more the adviser type, y’know? An ideas man, not an executive.

Chie Satonaka: I’m with Yosuke. If you’re the one calling the shots, I’d feel a lot more comfortable about this.

Teddie: I’m with Yosuke too. If you’re the one calling the shots, my pillow will be a lot more comfortable at night.

Chie Satonaka: Teddie, would you please stop talking? I’m really on edge right now…

> You’ve been unanimously appointed team leader. Your days of pursuing this case alongside your friends have beam… You have established the Investigation Team Social Link of the Fool Arcana! You may earn an EXP bonus when fusing Personas of the Fool Arcana!

Yosuke Hanamura: Okay. Let’s get some rest for today, so we’re ready for tomorrow on. And don’t forget to check the weather forecast. It gets foggy after a lot of rain, so let’s keep an eye out. Also, let’s make sure we gear up for next time.

> You decide to return to Jams and go back home. The three of you are having dinner.

Announcer: That’s all for world news tonight. Coming up next, the local news.

> Dojima is quiet, with a stern expression on his face.

Ryotaro Dojima: Hey. Mind if I ask something? You aren’t getting involved with any strange business, are you…? What happened at the station this afternoon… it’s still bothering me. Is there… anything you’re not telling me?

”Of course not.” ✔
”It’s nothing important.”
”Don’t worry.”

Ryotaro Dojima: …I see. Well, it’s just been nagging at me, that’s all…

Nanako Dojima: What’s wrong? Are you fighting?

Ryotaro Dojima: No… We’re not having a fight.

Nanako Dojima: This isn’t the police station…

Ryotaro Dojima: I agreed to look after you. So don’t get yourself involved in anything that could get you into trouble. Got that?

Weather announcer: And now, our weather forecast. Due to high-pressure fronts from the west, that sunny spring-like weather will stay with us for a while longer.

Nanako Dojima: Is this lady the one who decides the weather? ’Cause when she says that it’ll be sunny, it always is…

Ryotaro Dojima: Uh, she’s not really deciding it… …Never mind.

> The news continues, headless of the heavy atmosphere…

CHAPTER 7: The Aeon
> You can hear Nanako calling you from downstairs…

Mr. Morooka: *ahem* It’s me, Morooka. I have something that I’ve prepared just for you. I was going to deliver it to you house, but the situation’s changed. I need you to come pick it up. Er, where am I? I was getting to that! *ahem* I am in front of the gas station at the shopping district. You got that? Now hurry m and come pick it up!

> Morooka has summoned you…

Ryotaro Dojima: Who called you just now? Don’t tell me you’re planning on going out at this hour.

”My homeroom teacher need to see me.” ✔
”It’s nothing.”

Ryotaro Dojima: Your homeroom teacher wants to see you? You just transferred here, and you’ve already done something? No… This is you we’re talking about. Well, I understand. Go take care of business and hurry back have.

Female student:: But it’s not a lie! I really am on the way home from cram school! I can go home by myself! I wasn’t trying to stay out and party!

Mr. Morooka: Oh, you’re here. Sooner than I expected! This is the school jersey I got for you! Go on, take it!

> You obtained Yaso High Jersey.

Mr. Morooka: I need to see this girl home! You know the way to your own house, don’t you?

Samegawa Flood Plain

> The dog is digging at the ground with a single-minded determination that is admirable…

> You’ve finished your business. Return home? Yes/No

Ryotaro Dojima: You’re home. So, what was it? Huh? You were given a school jersey? That’s it? He could’ve just given you that at school… Well, I’m sure telling you that isn’t helping. School’s tough enough as it is. With these incidents going on, everyone’s on edge…

> You’re tired from everything that happened today…

> You should return to your room and rest…

April 18th, 2011. Monday.
[Early morning at school. The classes didn’t start yet.]

Yosuke Hanamura: I wonder how Chie’s doing. Too much stuff happened yesterday. I hope she’s back to her usual self…

Chie Satonaka: Um… Thanks for everything yesterday. It’s kinda embarrassing, ya know? You two were right there to see my hidden feelings and all… The same thing happened to Yosuke, right? Soooo… what was it like?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Uhhh, how should I put this… Oh, I nearly forgot! None of that happened when yours awakened, huh? Hmmm, could that be because you’ve got nothing to hide?

Chie Satonaka: Oh? So nothing happened for you? I gotta agree that you seem like a pretty open guy. There’s a funny air about you… I dunno, I guess that’s what draws people to you, or something like that.

> Unfortunately, you didn’t have enough Courage to actually say that…

Chie Satonaka: I dunno, I guess that’s what draws people to you, or something like that.

”Was that a compliment?” ✔
”Want me to bare it all?”
”Falling for me, huh?”

Chie Satonaka: Haha, yep, it’s a compliment. Anyways, what’s most important right now is to rescue Yukiko. I’m dead set on coming. Remember… You promised.

[The bell rings to announce the start of the class.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh crap, I still haven’t gone to the bathroom! (runs away)

Chie Satonaka: Th-Thanks for saving me… Yosuke’s cool and all, but… There really is something different about you. I feel like you won’t let me down…

> You sense Chie’s gratitude to you…

> You feel a faint bond forming between you and Chie…

Thou art I… And I am thou…
Thou hast established a new bond…
It brings thee closer to the truth…
Thou shalt be blessed when creating Personas of the Chariot Arcana…

> You have established the Chie Satonaka Social Link of the Chariot Arcana!

> You may earn an EXP buns when fusing Personas of the Chariot Arcana!

> Chie’s determination in battle has been enhanced…

> Chie can now wake to a knocked-down ally during battle!

> You haven’t yet asked Chie for her contact information.

> Unfortunately, you didn’t have enough Courage…

> You haven’t yet asked Chie for her contact information. 

Chie Satonaka: Oh… right. You’ll need this from now on, huh?

> You exchanged cell numbers with Chie.

Chie Satonaka: We have to be careful of the fog that sets in after the rain, right? Let’s save her before that happens!

> After the rain continues for a while, it may become foggy…

> You must train yourself as much as possible until then…

> You should go to the Junes food court on days that you want to explore the other world…

Mr. Kondo: Helloooo and good afternooooon, all! My name is Mr. Kondo, your P.E. teacher! But since no one at this school teaches English, I’ll be doubling up my roles! …Don’t be so disappointed. In fact, I’ve spent some time overseas! One week of vacation time, to be exact! But that’s more than enough to teach a class! Hahaha! We’ll start with the basics of the basics: the English alphabet! It starts with the letter A, then B, then C, and then… 23 more! Maybe that was a little too basic? Hahaha! All right! I’ll give you an alphabet- related pop quiz, then! Let’s see… Narukami! The word ”alphabet” comes from the words ”alpha” and what other one?

> You gave the answer you think is correct…

Mr. Kondo: It comes from the first two letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha and beta! By the way, any set of western European characters in a specific order is called an alphabet. In Japan, when we say ”alphabet” we’re talking about the English alphabet, but it doesn’t always mean the English one!

> You gave the correct answer…

> Your Knowledge has increased.

> Classes have ended for today.

> The fog will come after several days of rain… You must prepare to take action.

[At Velvet Room in Shopping District…]

Igor: Welcome… to the Velvet Room. Well, then… I shall tell you about how I can offer you my ”assistance.” I can gather a number of the Personas you possess and provide you with the ability to ”fuse” them. I have suggestions for the creation of powerful Personas that may be of use to you… If you want to summon a new Persona that you have not registered, please try the ”Summon Persona” option. However, if you register a Persona in the Compendium you will be able to summon that Persona by selecting ”Check Compendium.” If you wish to know more about the Compendium please ask Margaret. …I will now explain how to create new Personas through fusion. There is a variety of methods to fuse Personas together. A Normal Spread is a fusion of two Personas… A Triangle Spread is the fusion of three… There are many Persona cards that can be used as the basis for fusions, and an even larger number of fusion results. The drawback is that using multiple Personas in a fusion always. results in a single Persona… Do not forget this. Also, a Persona created through fusion may gain additional powers depending on the day it is created. Refer to the Fusion Forecast to help ensure that your fusion results go as you desire. If you would like a more detailed explanation, feel free to ask.

[Talking with Marie in Velvet Room…]

Marie: A wish? I don’t have any. I do… but it’s not for now. …Telling you wouldn’t help anyway.

> Marie doesn’t seem interested in you…

> It seems your relationship needs some sort of spark in order to deepen…

Marie: Oh… You came. You trust come here a lot, huh. Whatcha want this time? A Persona? A Skill Card? It doesn’t matter to me.

Margaret: …Excuse us. Marie, you must learn to restrain yourself.

Marie: Huh? What’s that supposed to mean? Stupiduptightblockheadtwerp.

Margaret: *sigh* I apologize sincerely. She is far too unruly for me to handle. *chuckle* You are mite right. However… This is all to help you on your journey. This room is inseparable from your fate. Nothing in this room happens without purpose …It seems that you and Marie had already met before you encountered her in this room. Encountering one who is not of man, and communicating with her… You fate has led you to this meeting.

”One who is not of man’?”
”Marie and I connected?”
”It’s not my problem.” ✔

Margaret: Well now… We shall see. This room is the crossroads of your fates. You, the customer, and she who is not of man, who has wandered into this place. Where will this meeting lead? Excuse me for saying so, but we, too, are a bit interested in the outcome. Though she was in this land before you, in the end, Marie is not of man… In other words, her understandings of the world in which you live is incomplete. Therefore… I ask of you to please take her outside this room, if you would. …Okay, Marie?

Marie: ……Wh… Whatever… Never mind.

> It seems Marie is interested in leaving this place…

> You should speak with her when you have the time…

Marie: Huh…? You came. I’m surprised. I didn’t think you were interested. Look, I’m sure you already know, but… I want you to take me somewhere. It’s small, it’s dark, The Nose never says anything. It’s stuffy in here. I’m really not supposed to leave the room, but Margaret said it’d be okay if I went with you. I… uh… Well, never mind. So, will you take me somewhere?

> It seems Marie is intent on going out…

> If you become closer to her, maybe she could tell you something…

”Sure.” ✔
”Maybe next time.”

Marie: Really?! …Don’t you think you’re giving in too easily? I’ll have you twisted around my finger if you keep this In. ”Twisted around my finger…” That’s the saying, right? I’ve been studying.

> You decided to take Marie outside the Velvet Room…

> Shopping District, in front of Souzai Daigaku…

> You took Marie out of the Velvet Room…

Marie: Phew. I can finally breathe now. It’s stuffy in that car. Y’know… I feel weird. It’s like… nostalgic, for the smell and all.

”Nostalgic?” ✔
”What smell?”
”Because it’s the countryside.”

Marie: Yeah, nostalgic. That’s what I said. It just… feels that way. There’s a lot of stuff that I’ve never noticed before. Hey, lady. I want one of those skewer things.

Lady: Oh, hello. That’ll be 320 yen, please.

Marie: Thwee hunnert twin… Bleh. That’s hard to say. …You can’t eat without money? You have money!? …That’s awesome. You’re awesome.

> Marie looks surprised…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yo, Yu. Gettin’ your steak on, huh? …She’s cute. What? What’s going on here? Who’s this!?

”She’s an acquaintance.”
”She’s a friend.” ✔
”She’s my little sister.”

Marie: Friend…? I guess… I don’t know.

Yosuke Hanamura: Ahh, I see. A ”friend,” you say, huh? Oh yeah, I’m Yosuke Hanamura. I’m his friend. His partner, y’know.

Marie: …Partner? You mean like a close friend?

Yosuke Hanamura: Heheh, that about sums it up. Er, what’s your name?

Marie: Huh…? Uh… Marie.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hmmm, Marie-chan, is it? You want a steak skewer? All right, this one’s on me!

Marie: …You mean you’ll buy it for me? …Is that okay?

”There’s no reason to decline.” ✔
”You should reserve yourself.”
”That’s great.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, don’t worry! I got a little extra in my last paycheck. Three steak skewers! One for each of us.

Lady: Oh my, business is booming! Just a moment, please.

> You ate Steak Skewers with Yosuke and Marie…

Yosuke Hanamura: Whew! Is that a bellyful or what! This place always has huge portions. So, Marie-chan, what’d you think of the local specialty?

Marie: It’s really weird. It’s tough, hard to bite into, and it got cold while I was still eating it.

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, uh… That’s good. …Didn’t sand like you liked it at the beginning there. But, all’s well that ends well!

Marie: Hey, why’s it called ”steak,” anyway? Is it short for something?

”It’s short for ‘Beefsteak.’”
”It’s short for ‘Steak-out.’”
”It’s short for ‘Steeeaaaaaaak.’” ✔

Marie: …That’s stupid. Might as well just call it ”ake.” That’s what I’m gonna do.

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh, that isn’t much better… And you! Don’t tell her lies! She’s believing it!

Marie: You eat this every day? …No fair. I sould’ve come earlier…

> It seems Marie has taken a liking to Steak Skewers…

> You made small talk with Yosuke and Marie…

Yosuke Hanamura: Ah, crap! I left my key back in my locker at work! I’ve gotta go back to Junes! See you later, Yu! You too, Marie-chan!

Marie: …Your ”partner” is a funny person. But he bought me meat. That makes him a good person. That is fact. Hey, let’s go somewhere else. Somewhere with a nice view.

> The hill overlookoing town…

> After several times in which you lost Marie the moment you took your eyes off her, you managed to bring her here…

Marie: Hmmm… It’s really green here. Green and… green. And some brown and… Darker green? Leaves of green fly away, Farewell to you, clouds of the sky… I fly as well, lost as the day, Farewell to you, moon of the night.

> Marie is murmuring something to herself… Whatever it is, it rhymes…

Marie: N-No! I-I-I wasn’t making up a poem! It’s just some words that I was thinking! That’s all! Yeah! ShutupIhateyouyoustupidjerk! D-Don’t snoop on me! I don’t know why… but I feel good about this place. It reminds me of something. Are there any other places we can go? I want to see more. ….No I’m not going home. I notice a lot of things when I’m with you. It’s pretty fun.

> You sense that Marie expects something of you…

> You feel that you understand Marie a bit more now…

Thou art I… And I am thou…
Thou hast established a new bond…
It brings thee closer to the truth…
Thou shalt be blessed when creating Personas of the Aeon Arcana…

> You have established the Marie Social Link of the Aeon Arcana!

> You may earn an EXP bows when fusing Personas of the Aeon Arcana!

Marie: All right, next! Where to now?

> You show Marie around, then escort her back to the Velvet Room…

> It seems Dojima isn’t home…

> Sneak out to the town at night? Yes/No

> This month’s schedule is…

> Your Knowledge may increase if you studied here.

> Do you want to study? Yes/No

> You decided to study.

> Your Knowledge has increased.

April 19th, 2011. Tuesday.
[On the next day someone is calling Yu…]

Margaret: I realize this is sudden, but… I’m Margaret. We met at the Velvet Room the other day. There is one important point I forgot to warn you about, so I thought it best to contact you immediately. Going to save your friends is a selfless and noble deed… By all means, we encourage and support you in regards to this matter. But to proceed too hastily in that quest will mean facing one battle after the next. Though you may be pressed for time, devoting yourself to battle will not quench your heart’s yearnings. The bonds created through Social Links are another important means of strengthening the powers of your Persona… Do not hasten heedlessly through your days, and remember the importance of moving at a sustainable pace. Please remember that. Well then, if you’ll excuse me…

> You took Margaret’s advice to heart.

> You should think carefully about how you spend your days…

[Going to school…]

Male student in a sweatsuit: Yo…

Cheerful male student: Oh, what’s up? You got morning practice?

> You can hear the two talking…

Male student in a sweatsuit: You know how guys can join the sports clubs starting today, right?

Cheerful male student: Dude… If you run around in that, how’re people gonna know which club you’re in?

Male student in a sweatsuit: …I didn’t think about that.

Cheerful male student: Haha! That’s classic you. I hope our club gets some fresh blood, too. It gets everyone excited!

Male student in a sweatsuit: Are you guys not going to try and get people to sign up?

Cheerful male student: I don’t know about that. Everyone’s saying they want a girl to be our manager, though. Oh, hey! Let’s stop by the shrine in the shopping district on our way home today. Might as well pray for some newcomers.

Male student in a sweatsuit: We’re leaving that up to God now…? Well, all right. Oh yeah, did you hear that rumor? About the thing that lives at the shrine?

Cheerful male student: I did! I wonder if it’s true.

> Classes have ended for today. The fog will come after several days of rain… You must prepare to take action.

> You recall being told that you can join a sports club. Maybe you can find out how to join one by visiting the faculty office on the first floor of the classroom building…

Female student: Have you heard that the Midnight Channel reveals the person you’re destined for? Everyone’s totally into that lately. Especially me! I wonder if I could get it to work… Hehe, only one way to find out! Especially me! I wonder If I could get it to work… Hehe, only one way to find out! What about YOU, Senpai? Is there a certain someone you’d like to see in the TV?

”Kinda.” ✔
”No, not really.”

Female student: REALLY!? Oh, it pains me not to ask who, but… I shall refrain! Ahhh, the beauty of being young! Good luck, Senpai!

Athletic student: Hey man, what do you think of the mountains!?

”They’re fine…” ✔
”Don’t like ‘em much.”
”Who cares?”

Athletic student: Cool, great minds think alike! Well, I’ve mostly only read about them, but… aren’t they awesome!? A lot of people say there’s like, negative and positive ions in the mountains that are good for you health!

> This is the faculty office. Maybe you can inquire about joining a club…

”Go inside and ask about clubs.” ✔
”Maybe another time.”

Mr. Morooka: Eh? You want to join a club? Ohhh, no! I know what you’re really after! You’re just trawling for girls, aren’t you!? Admit it! Listen up! A club is apposed to be…

> For some reason, you find yourself getting lectured…

Mr. Morooka: So, still want to join a club?

”Ask about sports clubs.” ✔
”Ask about cultural clubs.”
”Ask about multiple clubs.”
”Nothing.”

Mr. Morooka: Trying to break a youthful sweat, are you!? After leaving the faculty office, make a left, and go through the exit down the hall to get to where the snorts club meet! By the way, club days are Tuesday. Thursday, and Saturday! Sports clubs don’t meet on rainy days! Got it!? So are we done here?Go home already! Are you staying at school to hang out with a girl later on or something!?

> You can go to the gym or the field from here.

> It seems the clubs are practicing.

> Do you want to join the basketball or the soccer club…?

> Come to think of it… You recall Igor’s words…

Igor: ”As you form bonds by becoming involved with others, you’ own Social Links will gradually develop. The power of these Social Links is what will determine you’ Persona’s abilities.”

> …You wonder if you can create a Social Link here…

> Will you join the basketball or soccer club…?

”Join the basketball club.”
”Join the soccer club.” ✔
”Take a tour first.”
”Never mind.”

P. E. teacher: …Alright guys, listen up. You have a new teammate! You all know Yu Narukami, right? He’s from the city, so I’m sure he’s got some moves he’s just waiting to show off! I’d say this season is in the bag! I’m even thinking about making him captain!

> You can hear the other players whispering…

Team members: The city, huh? I bet he played for some big team back home… Tch, look at him. City slicker… Probably thinks he’s better than us… Yeah, we’re just a buncha hicks to him…

P. E. teacher: Here, why don’t you say something to the team?

”Hi…”
”Nice to meet you.” ✔
”I’m your new captain.”

Team members: …Yeah.

> They don’t seem very friendly…

P.E. teacher: Alright, let’s start with a few laps! Yu, why don’t you just watch for today? Practices are on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, but we don’t practice in the rain. We take the week before exams off too, so make sure you use that time to study hard, okay?

> The other players, showing no interest in you, dispersed about the field…

Soccer player: Don’t let ’em get to you. Just play hard and have fun. I’m Daisuke Nagase. Second year, same as you. Nice to meet you.

Male student: Yo Daisuke, you waiting for a special invitation!? Let’s go! Oh, hey, you’re the transfer student, right? Joined the soccer team, huh? Good, ’cause they need all the help they can get. Pretty weak team, know what I’m saying? Good, ’cause they need all the help they can get. Pretty weak team, know what I’m saying?

Daisuke Nagase: Shut up! Your team is just as lame!

Daisuke Nagase: This big mouth here is Kou. He’s the same grade as us, but he’s on the basketball team.

Male student: Kou Ichijo. I’m the basketball team’s up-and-coming MVP.

Daisuke Nagase: Man, get your head outta the clouds.

Kou Ichijo: Hey, and that’s not all! I’m pretty smart too, so if you need any help on your tests, I’m you man. …How ’bout it, transfer student? You a smart guy?

Daisuke Nagase: Stop calling him that. The team’s already giving him enough crap as it is…

Kou Ichijo: Ahhh, I can hear it now. ”Us country folk ain’t some set shown to by no big shot city boy!” Gotta love those guys. Well, as long as he’s got some skills, they’ll back off sooner or later. You played much soccer before, Yu?

”Plenty.”
”A little.” ✔
”Not even once.”

Kou Ichijo: Hmmm, then maybe this’ll take longer than I thought…

> You became friends with Kou Ichijo of the basketball team and Daisuke Nagase of the soccer team.

> They accepted you regardless of the rest of the team’s hostility.

> You feel a faint bond forming between the three of you…

> You have established the Fellow Athletes Social Link of the Strength Arcana! 

> You may earn an EXP bonus when fusing Personas of the Strength Arcana!

Daisuke Nagase: Dammit, now I’m behind on my laps. Yu, wait up for me so we can walk home together.

Kou Ichijo: Alright, I’ll go get changed. See you in a few.

> You finished watching practice and walked home with Kou and Daisuke.

CHAPTER 8: Yukiko’s Castle
> Do you want to study? Yes/No

> Your Knowledge has increased.

Mr. Hosoi: My name is Mr. Hosoi and in this class you’ll be learning about contemporary writing. Let’s all have fun. I know this is off-topic, but what’s the point of applying for colleges outside Inaba? Why even bother? Nothing good ever comes out of carpeting with city-folk. The countryside is all you need. Well, since this is our very first lesson, why don’t you show me how much you already know. Now, then… How many parts are there in Murakami’s ”The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle”? Hana-chan! I’m calling on you! I get the feeling you’re not much of a reader!

Yosuke Hanamura: Yu! C’mon, man, help me here!

> You gave him the answer you think is correct.

”Two.”
”Three.” ✔
”Seven.”

Mr. Hosoi: Very good , Hana-chan! Either you’re more literary than you look, or that was a lucky guess. Very good , Hana-chan! Either you’re more literary than you look, or that was a lucky guess. ”The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle” was released as three separate stories. It’s the eighth of his twelve published books. His latest book, ”1Q84,” was published in 2009. Its first printing sold out on the very first day of sale! And, of course, that’s not counting all his short stories and essays, which I don’t have time to get into right now.

Yosuke Hanamura: Phew… You’re a life saver, Yu. Thanks.

> Yosuke appreciates you!

> You feel you’ve become a little closer to Yosuke…

> Your Expression has increased.

> Classes have ended for today.

> The fog will come after several days of rain… You must prepare to take action.

[Going to the town…]

[Bookstore.]

> It seems a new book has arrived.

> ”The Lovely Man”
Price: 1200 yen.
The famous Man series--now in stock!

> Should I buy it…?

> Books can be read somewhere that you can be alone.

> Perhaps you should try reading them on the sofa in your room once you’re home…

[School.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Yo, Yu. …You tired? Rushing things isn’t gonna help us… I know! How ’bout we take a little break?

> Maybe you should hang out with Yosuke and relax…

> Since you have Pixie, a Persona of the Magician Arcana, you feel you could be closer…

> You feel your relationship with Yosuke is going to become closer soon…

> Will you spend the afternoon with Yosuke? Yes/No

> Shopping District, Souzai Daigaku…

> The famous steak croquettes are tough…

Yosuke Hanamura: Sticking chunks of steak in croquettes… Man, this really is the country, huh? Well, it is good… though it’s tough.

Chie Satonaka: called this stuff ”tender and juicy”… What kinda teeth does she have…?

> You can hear the women’s conversation…

Gossiping lady: He’s from Junes… Yasogami High School, right?

Talkative lady: His classmate… Sato-san…? Went out of business…

Gossiping lady: This shopping district could disappear, and yet…

Yosuke Hanamura: Sorry about that. You know me, I’m infamous around here.

”It must be tough.” ✔
”You’re bragging about it?”
”Why are you infamous?”

Yosuke Hanamura: Naah, not really. It’s mainly my parents, I’m not personally involved. Anyways, there’s nothing I can do about it.

> Yosuke shrugs…

Yosuke Hanamura: I don’t think there’s anyone in Inaba who doesn’t know me, at school or around town… Not that I mind, but… It sucks that I always gotta mind my manners.

> Yosuke smiles cheerfully…

> You feel you understand Yosuke a bit more…

> The Yosuke Hanamura’s Social Link has reached level 2!

> Your power to create Personas of the Magician Arcana has grown!

> Yosuke’s growth of heart has affected his Persona as well…

Yosuke Hanamura: Still, this croquettes is darn good, huh? I’m gonna have another. You want one too, right?

> You ate croquettes with Yosuke until your stomach started to bulge, then went home…

Nanako Dojima: I went to the bookstore, but it was full of all these crazy books. It didn’t have the manga I like to read.

> You remember that you have a book that you haven’t finished yet. Perhaps you should sit on the sofa and read…

> A sofa suitable for reading on.

> You have a book right now…

> Read The Lovely Man? Yes/No

> You begin reading The Lovely Man…

> Every chapter begins: ”All men have the great spirit of masculinity within themselves.”

> This spirit of true manhood transcends space and time, and all people, of all cultures and genders, feel its call…

> …You feel more like a real man than ever before.

> There’s still some pages of The Lovely Man left.

> You decide to save them to read next time.

> Classes have ended for today.

> The fog will come after several days of rain… You must prepare to take action.

[Shopping District, South I]

> It seems that you can go to the food court from here.

> Call your friends to meet up at the food court?

Chie Satonaka: Everyone’s here, right?

[They enter the TV.]

Chie Satonaka: Don’t worry! We can do this!

Teddie: Let’s play! Huh? No time? I’ll take you to the castle! Let me know when you’re ready, Sensei. Leave it to me to show the way!

”Search for Yukiko” ✔
”Never mind”

Teddie: Okay! Let me show you the way! If you don’t want to waste time walking back to the entrance, use this to teleport back here. Be careful!

[Yu enters the castle.]

Teddie: Hrmm… Sensei, can I bother you for a second? The hall here seems different from before, so this place might set pretty tricky… But I’m with you! Don’t you worry, Sensei!

> Obtained 1 Peach Seed.

[Couple of battles later Yu finds big door.]

Teddie: I sense someone behind this door…

[The gang enters the door.]

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yukiko-san! Are you all right!?

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko… what’s wrong?

Yukiko Amagi: *chuckle* Heehee. Ahahahahahaha ! Oh my! Special guests? I wonder how they’ll play into all this! *chuckle* Things are really heating up! Okie-dokie! I’m going to hunt for my Price Charming! Ohhh, where could he be…? This place is huge! It’s sooo exciting, but it makes it so hard to find him! Ooh! Maybe he’s playing hide-and-seek in the fog! Ready or not, here I come! Let’s go further in then, shall we!?

[Logo appears: ”Princess Yukiko’s HUNT FOR HER PRINCE CHARMING!”. The gang hear applause.]>

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What the hell is this!?

Chie Satonaka: You’re not Yukiko… Who are you!?

Yukiko Amagi: *chuckle* What’re you talking about? I’m Yukiko… and Yukiko is me.

Chie Satonaka: No! Don’t tell me, are you--!? Where’s the real Yukiko!?

Yosuke Hanamura: What’s with these voices…

Teddie: The Shadows are getting agitated!

Yukiko: Well, I’m off again! Heehee! You’d better be waiting with bells on, my dear Prince!

[She leaves.]

Chie Satonaka: Hey, wait! That clearly wasn’t the real Yukiko. It had to be…

Teddie: I think it was. It must have been the other part of herself.

Yosuke Hanamura: So it’s just like what happened to us…

Teddie: But I don’t think she was excited for nothing. The real Yukiko wants to show us something. I can feel it. It’s hard to explain… It seems like she has a strong connection to this castle. This is a lot more dangerous than I thought!

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko…! (runs away)

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey… Not again! Dammit, we told her not to run off on her own!

> You hear voices from somewhere…

Yukiko’s voice: Teeheehee… My Prince will soon come for me. *chuckle* I’ll always be waiting… Forever and ever…

Teddie: Hrmm… I hear her voice… But all I sense around here are you and Shadows. Watch out for the Shadows, and keep going! When a Shadow has its back to you, carefully get in close and snack it!

[On the next floor.]

Yukiko’s voice: Thank you for coming to the Amagi Inn today. Your room is right this way. If we can help you in any way, please let us know immediately.

Teddie: …What’s this voice talking about? This place isn’t an inn. It’s totally a castle!

[On the next floor.]

Teddie: Where is she?

Yukiko’s voice: Hmhmhm… Ohoho…

Teddie: I can sense her! She must be on this floor!

Yukiko’s voice: Wow! By any chance, are you… My Princes? I’m locked up here… Please save me! Hmhmhm… I’m sure my Princes can do it… I’m sure they’ll brave any danger to release me from this place… I’ll be waiting for you! Ohoho…

Teddie: This seems very strange… Be careful.

[The heroes find another locked door.]

> The door seems to be locked…

Teddie: I can sense someone beyond this door… It’s that girl’s scent!

> Open the door and enter? Yes/No

CHAPTER 9: Shadow Yukiko
Teddie: I sense someone beyond this door… It’s that girl’s scent!

> Open the door and enter?

Yukiko Amagi: *chickle* My Prince wouldn’t lose to guards such as this, correct?

Teddie: Gyaaaaaah! I’ve never seen such a strong one before!

[After the gang defeat Yukiko’s Prince…]

Yukiko’s voice: *chickle* If you really are my Prince, then we will sure meet again. I am but a trapped soul… I can not leave this place even if I wished… *chickle*

Teddie: I don’t sense her anymore… Oh! Are you okay, Senpai? I’m sure we’ve got a lag ways to go. Don’t push yourself too hard! If you’re tired, you should head back!

[When entering the new floor, the gang hear a voice…]

Reporter’s voice: In other words, she’s a manager who’s still in high school. Now that has a nice ring to it… Let’s see if we can interview her. Excuse me!

Yukiko’s voice: Shut up!

Male student’s voice: H-Hey, Yukiko-san. Mind if I ask you something…? Is it true that announcer’s staying at your family’s inn?

Yukiko’s voice: Shut up, shut up!

Reporter’s voice: Someday, though… That aside, wow! You’re looking gorgeous in that kimono. You must have a lot of male visitors.

Yukiko’s voice: Leave me alone! I'm sick of it…

Teddie: I don’t get what’s going on with all those voices, but I can sense that we’re getting closer. Hang in there!

[On the next floor.]

Yukiko’s voice: Hasn’t my Prince come yet? My dear Prince… Please hurry and take me away! Somewhere… To a world where no one knows me…

Teddie: It’s close! She’s just beyond here!

[The gang approaches the door.]

Teddie: Huh? This smell is… It must be her! She’s right behind this door!

[Yu bravely opens it!]

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko!

Yosuke Hanamura: I knew it… There’s two of her!

Shadow Yukiko: Oh? Oooooh, what’s this? Three princes are here to see me!? My, my! Are you the surprise guests who came in late? Awwwww… I wish I’d gotten a better look at you! My, it’s getting crowded here. Why don’t you and I go somewhere else…? A land far, far away, where no one knows me. If you’re my Prince, you’d take me there, won’t you? C’mon… pretty please?

Teddie: Oooh. Is this ”scoring a hot stud”!?

Chie Satonaka: Three princes…? Wait, does that include me, too…?

Teddie: Duh! The third one’s gotta be me!

Yosuke Hanamura: I seriously doubt that…

Shadow Yukiko: Chie… *chuckle* Yes, she’s my Prince… She always leads the way… Chie’s a strong prince… Or at least she WAS.

Chie Satonaka: Was..?

Shadow Yukiko: When it comes down to it, Chie’s just not good enough! She can’t take me away from here! She can’t save me!

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko…

Yukiko Amagi: S-stop…

Shadow Yukiko: Historic inn? Manager training!? I’m sick of all these things chaining me down! I never asked to be born here! Everything’s decided for me! I’m so sick of it! To hell with it all!

Yukiko Amagi: That’s not true…

Shadow Yukiko: I just want to go somewhere far away… Anywhere but here… Someone, please take me away… I can’t leave here on my own… I’m completely useless…

Yukiko Amagi: Stop… Please stop…

Shadow Yukiko: I have no hope if I stay, and no courage to leave… So I sit on my ass hoping that someday my Prince will come! I don’t care where we go! Anywhere’s fine! As long as it’s not here, I don’t give a damn! Historical tradition? Pride of the town? What a bunch of bullshit!

Yukiko Amagi: How dare you…?

Shadow Yukiko: That’s how I really feel. Isn’t that right… me!?

Yukiko Amagi: N-no…

Yosuke Hanamura: Stop! Don’t say it!

Yukiko Amagi: No! You’re not me!

Shadow Yukiko: Heeheehee… ! Aaaah! This feels wonderful! It’s this building… more and more… If keeps up… I’ll… I’ll…! *chuckle* Ahaha! Ahahahahahaha!

[She transforms into giant phoenix like bird in a cage.]

Yukiko Amagi: (shocked) Aagh!

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko!

Teddie: We have to stop it! That girl’s in danger!

Yosuke Hanamura: We know!

Chie Satonaka: It’s all right, Yukiko… Just hang in there! We’ll save you!

[The fight begins.]

Shadow Yukiko: I am a shadow… The true self… Now, my Prince… Why don’t we dance and make merry together? *chuckle*

Chie Satonaka: Hang in there, Yukiko… I’m right here for you!

Shadow Yukiko: Oh really… ? Then I’ll make sure to give you plenty to deal with!

[The gang hits Shadow Yukiko a couple of times…]

Shadow Yukiko: What, are you trying to make me mad…? *chuckle* We’re not done yet. Show me this strength of yous! Come, my Prince… Heeheehee… (after the heroes defeats him) My prince! My dear prince! (Yukiko tries to summon another one) Why… Why won’t he come… ? Hmph, looks like I had the wrong idea… You’re no princes… Die, you worthless commoners!

[Shadow Yukiko defeated.]

Yukiko Amagi: Ngh…

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko! Yukiko, are you hurt…!?

Yukiko Amagi: No. I’m not--

Yosuke Hanamura: We understand. You’re not the only one like that, Yukiko-san. Everyone has something they can’t show to other people, or don’t want to admit to themselves…

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko… I’m sorry. I was so self-centered that… I never understood what you were going through… I’m your friend, and I still… I’m so sorry…

Yukiko Amagi: Chie…

Chie Satonaka: I was always jealous of you, Yukiko. You had everything that I didn’t… That jealousy was like a wall, and I was so lonely…! I wanted you to need me… But it was me who needed you. I can’t do anything right on my own… I’ve caused so much table for Yosuke and the others. If you weren’t by my side, I… I wouldn’t know what to do…

Yukiko Amagi: Chie… I never saw the real you either… I was too busy trying to find an easy way out. (to shadow self) ”I want to run away”… ”I want someone to save me”… You’re right, those feelings are part of me, too. I understand now… You’re me.

> The strength of heart required to face oneself has been made manifest…

> Yukiko has faced her other self…

> She has obtained the facade used to overcome life’s hardships, the Persona Konohana Sakuya!

[Yukiko falls on the floor.]

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko!

Yosuke Hanamura: Are you okay?

Yukiko Amagi: Yes, I’m just a little tired… You all came to rescue me…?

Chie Satonaka: Of course!

Yukiko Amagi: Thank you…

Chie Satonaka: (wiping tears)Don’t even mention it. I’m just so glad you’re safe…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hehe… Right on.

Teddie: So, who threw you in here?

Yukiko Amagi: Huh…? Who are you? Rather… What are you?

Teddie: I’m Teddie! So, who threw you in?

Yukiko Amagi: I don’t know… I think… someone called my name… But my memory’s a blur. I can’t remember who it was… I’m sorry, um… Teddie.

Teddie: No new clues…

Yosuke Hanamura: Not necessarily. Now we know for sure that someone threw Yukiko-san in here.

Teddie: Hrmm… Then it really isn’t you guys…

”Of course not! ” ✔
”You still suspected us?”
”Are you satisfied now?”

Teddie: J-Just joking!

Yosuke Hanamura: You little…! You’re one lying sack of honey…

Chie Satonaka: Anyways, let’s hurry back home. Yukiko looks exhausted… Thanks again, Teddie!

Teddie: Huh? Wait, you’re leavin’ me here?

Yosuke Hanamura: Leaving you? What’re you talking about? You live here.

Teddie: Well… yeah, but…

Yukiko Amagi: I’m sorry, Teddie. I promise to come again… So be a good boy and wait here until then.

[She pets Teddie.]

Teddie: R-Raaaawr! My, it’s getting crowded here. Why don’t you and I go somewhere else…? C’mon… Pretty please?

Yosuke Hanamura: Gah… You’re giving me the creeps! That’s it, you’re stuck here for the rest of your life!

[We’re back at the mall’s food court.]

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko…? Are you all right? You’re not hurt anywhere, are you?

Yukiko Amagi: No… I’m just a little tired…

”How did you get in there?”
”Do you remember anything?” ✔
”Did you see the killer?”

Yukiko Amagi: I’m sorry, but… I don’t remember anything…

Chie Satonaka: Well, no worries! You’re safe, and that’s more than enough.

Yosuke Hanamura: But there’s no mistake that Yukiko-san was… uh… …Attacked… the same way as the last two victims. And I think the one we saw on the Midnight Channel wasn’t the real Yukiko-san, but her Shadow. Maybe the things Yukiko-san was suppressing in this world took form in the TV…?

Chie Satonaka: You know, Teddie was saying something like that…

Yosuke Hanamura: Awww, it’s no use. I’m just going round and round in circles. What kinda person could be doing this?

”Let’s give it some thought.”
”Let’s call it a day.” ✔

> You’re worried about Yukiko’s condition right now…

> Your Understanding has increased.

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, we can go over it some other day. Yukiko really needs to get some rest. I’ll take her home.

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, that’s right… Sorry. Yukiko-san must be exhausted. (Yukiko leaves) We’ll talk about all this some more once she gets her strength back.

> You were able to rescue Yukiko safely.

> But this case’s mysteries have deepened even further…

> For now, you should wait for Yukiko to recover.

[Dojima’s house.]

Nanako Dojima: He’s home! (she see a man with her dad) Um… hello…

Young detective: Hi there.

Ryotaro Dojima: We got off work at the same time, so I’m giving him a ride back to his place. I thought we might as well swim by.

Young detective: Nice to meet ya. I’m Adachi, the guy who’s been your dad’s slave since spring.

Ryotaro Dojima: I can still work you harder, you know.

Tohru Adachi: Haha, good one, Sir! Ha… ha… Oh, I almost forgot! You’re friends with Yukiko Amagi, right? They found her safe and sound! Tell all your friends at school!

”That’s a relief.” ✔
”We all know already.”
”We owe you a lot.”

Tohru Adachi: Yeah, for us on the force too. But this doesn’t mean the case is closed, though. We were just questioning Ms. Amagi, but she says she doesn’t remember anything that happened while she was missing. And we can’t figure out her whereabouts during the missing period, either. It’s like she really disappeared. It’s all pretty fishy, if you ask me… Like there’s something else some on…

[Dojima hits him.]

Tohru Adachi: Ow!

Ryotaro Dojima: Stop blabbering, dumbass!

Tohru Adachi: S-Sorry…

Ryotaro Dojima: Ignore him. He’s just spouting some wild fantasy.

”I’ll forget it, then.” ✔
”Yukiko isn’t involved.”
”Are you doubting Yukiko…?”

Ryotaro Dojima: Yeah, don’t give it a second thought. Sheesh, he’s a real pain sometimes…

Nanako Dojima: I’m hungry.

Ryotaro Dojima: Hey, you’re right. My stomach’s growling too.

Tohru Adachi: Hahaha, so you do have a softer side around Nanako-chan, Sir.

Ryotaro Dojima: Shut up and siddown… And wash those hands first! Hm, I should do the same…

> Dinner promises to be lively for once…

April 22nd, 2011. Friday. School
> Classes have ended for today.

> You are waiting for Yukiko to recover.

CHAPTER 10: Ladies Man
Old Lady Shiroku: We’ve received some new merchandise.

[You restock your items.]

> This vending machine sells drinks for 120 yen each. You have 42888 yen. What would you like to buy?

[You buy EVERYTHING.]

> It looks like all the drinks are sold out…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yo, Yu. If you’re free, wanna go somewhere?

> Yosuke wants to go somewhere.

> Since you have Pixie, 3 Persona of the Magician Arcana, you feel you could be closer… 

> You feel your relationship with Yosuke is going to become closer soon…

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright! Let’s go, then.

> Yosuke looks happy. 

> Okina City, in front of Okina Station…

> Yosuke brought you all the way here…

Yosuke Hanamura: Mmm… It’s been a while since I breathed this kinda air! Y’know, I’m just a poor little city boy drawn to that urban scent. Wait a minute… Am I starting to sound like Teddie?

”He’s sounding like you too.”
”Teddie’s cute.”
”Hrun, you’re looking hairier.” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Now that you mention it, the foam in my facial soap this morning had…! H-Hey, you’re making me scare myself!

> Yosuke is smiling… 

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, that aside, what should we-- Oh, a text message. More spam… Looks like someone got my address I get a lot of spam.

”You don’t block them?” ✔
”Why not change addresses?
”Eh, what can you do.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Even when I do, they charge domains, so there’s no point. And I don’t wanna change my address…

> Yosuke is sighing… 

Yosuke Hanamura: I haven’t changed addresses since before we moved to Inaba. I mean, I might get a text from someone. …It’s hard to call, y’know? If I called people just to tell them my number changed, they’d get annoyed. And some of them never planned to text me anyway… Oh but hey, don’t look at me like I don’t have any friends! Though to tell you the truth, I don’t remember what we all used to talk about. Can’t really call ’em friends… Inaba suits me just fine. Plus… I got something I need to do there. I’m counting on ya, partner!

Chatty girl: Hey, did you hear? There are some part-time job listings on the town bulletin board now! *sigh* I wish there was one that would let me make some quick cash. Maybe I don’t… But, I bet I’ll be more diligent if I get a job! I bet you wouldn’t do too well with a job where you have to work with others because you lack Understanding, huh?

Girl with braids: I don’t need to work, since I’m focusing on my studies. If my grades we good, I might be able to swing a raise in m allowance.

Chatty girl: That’s cheating! *sigh* I wish I was born into a rich family so I didn’t need a part-time job. Or if I knew someone nice enough to buy me anything I wanted.

Girl with braids: …I don’t think that would’ve been so great. There’s someone like that at our school too.

Chatty girl: Huh? Ohhh!

Girl with long hair: (passing by) …Hmph.

[In the classroom.]

Ms. Sofue: Well then, I’ll begin my lecture on the Age of Discovery, which occurred between the 15th and 17th centuries. Many types of vegetation were introduced to Europe during this era. Gardening for pleasure was becoming popular causing the price of tulip bulbs to rise. It was the world’s first economic bubble incident: ”Tulip mania.” Along with the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company, it is aid to be one of the biggest bubbles in European history. Hey! Mr. Hanamura, wake up! What was the first economic bubble incident in the world?

Yosuke Hanamura: Ngh!? … What? H-Help, Yu! What’s this ergonomic bubble she’s asking about!?

The South Sea Bubble
The Mississippi Company
The Great Depression
Tulip mania ✔

> You gave him the answer you think is correct.

Ms. Sofue: Hmm, so you were actually listening. Yes, it was tulip mania. Tulip bulbs inverted into Holland became extremely popular, and prices jumped dramatically as a result. At its highest, a single bulb was worth the price of a luxurious house. However, once the bubble bust, prices fell once again, and the trade cities in Holland were thrown into confusion. Mr. Hanamura, do take care to not let that snot-bubble of yours bust, or you may also be thrown into confusion.

Yosuke Hanamura: I’m not making snot bubbles! Anyway, I was right, wasn’t I? …But, yeah, thanks, Yu. I’ll have to stay awake for the next one.

> You told Kou that you’re going to tear down the goals and clean up.

Kou Ichijo: Let me guess, they told you it was your job? Tch, how predictable. But yeah, you should probably do it anyway.

Daisuke Nagase: How come? They got no right to darn it all on him…

Kou Ichijo: Don’t do it because they told you to, do it because you ”want to help.” That’ll throw ’em off guard. Here, I’ll help out too. It’ll go faster.

> The three of you cleaned up the field.

Kou Ichijo: Whew, I’m beat…

Daisuke Nagase: …I didn’t notice.

Kou Ichijo: Really? What a waste.

Daisuke Nagase: Enough of that crap. Yu, wanna stay after practice to work on your game a little more? Let’s show those guys what you can do.

Kou Ichijo: Yeah, that’s a good idea. If you can run circles around them, they’ll have to accept you, right?

Girl’s voice: Oh, there you are, Hanamura!

Yosuke Hanamura: …For example. Hello there, Senpai. What’s wrong today?

Gaudy student: You better say something to that blockhead manager! I told him I can’t come in on Saturdays or Sundays. But he’s saying I have to be here since we’re low on staff. And if I don’t, he’ll fire me!

Snooty student: Isn’t there some kinda law against that!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Er, but… Didn’t you guys say you could work weekends during your interviews?

Gaudy student: Well, yeah. They wouldn’t hire us if we didn’t!

Yosuke Hanamura: …Alright, I got it. I’ll try talking with him… But you don’t want to get fired, right? It’d make it easier for me to strike a deal if you could show up every now and then on weekends…

Gaudy student: …We’ll think about it.

Snooty student: You’d better do it, ’kay?

Woman’s voice: Oh, Yosuke-kun. Just the man I was looking for.

Yosuke Hanamura: Geez… Everyone’s just trying to take advantage of me as the Junes kid. Maybe I wouldn’t mind if I was free, but we have the murderers to deal with. I don’t have time for this. Can the police really handle the killer? Can the law really convict whoever’s behind this…? Once I started worrying about that stuff, I knew I couldn’t bother with anything else.

It’s only with you guys that I talk seriously like this. I dunno why, but I feel like I don’t have to lie… …Especially with you. You’ve already seen the worst of me and all.

Energetic girl: The cultural clubs are accepting new applicants starting today! You’re welcome to join, even if you’re already in a sports club. Hmm… Which cultural club should I join?

Brisk girl: You’re going to join a sports AND cultural club? Aren’t you going to end up half-assing both of them?

Energetic girl: Ouch…! You don’t have to be so harsh. I mean, I put some thought into this. Studying and grades are important, but I thought I should join a club and improve my personal skills.

Brisk girl: Oh. Then do you want to join our club? If you’re serious about it, we’d welcome you.

Running girl: (passing by) G-Gotta get ready…! M-My bag…!

Mr. Kondo: Good morning! Today, I’ll have you run so much, you’ll have sore muscles! Hahaha! Don’t look so sad! Everything requires muscles, after all! Why am I going to make you run until you’re sore? Because that’s how your muscles grow efficiently! Hey, Narukami! Answer this one: what’s it called when you gain more muscle after getting sore through exercise?

”Overgrowth.”
”Overcompersation.” ✔
”Overexertion.”

> You gave the answer you thought was right…

Mr. Kondo: You rust be working out, Narukami! That’s right! It’s called overcompersation! If you rest for a couple of days after getting muscle soreness, you’ll have more muscle than you started with! If you use this to your advantage, you can gain muscle efficiently! Now! Enough jibber jabber! I’ll have you run until you’re sore! Forget about your other classes! Just run! Work hard! You can do it! Hahaha!

Male student: Oh, a new guy? You’re Narukami, from second year, right? The transfer student? I see, I see. Welcome to the drama club! I’m the club president, Nagai. And this is…

Yumi Ozawa: I’m in the second year, same as you. It’s nice to meet you.

Suspicious student: Yumi, are you trying to set your hooks into the new guy already?

Yumi Ozawa: Huh? Not in the slightest. Anyway, let’s continue practicing.

Drama club president: We don’t have a stage, and we haven’t decided on a script yet, so we’re just training. I’m sure you’ll catch on. Our club meets on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.

Kind student: We’re not gonna throw you out if you don’t show up, but the more you train, the better you get, right? I think being in the drama club helps you learn how to express yourself more eloquently. Oh yeah, I’m the club’s vice president. I’m not really much help, though…

Mrs. Nakayama: I’ve heard there’s a mysterious animal dwelling in the shopping district area. Supposedly, it knows how to search the change dispenser of the vending machines. How amazing is that?

You can’t do anything without it! And you know, smarts don’t guarantee wealth. …Anyway, I sues I should do what they pay me for and lecture you.

> Yukiko seems more cheerful than before.

Yukiko Amagi: My mother’s back to work already. The maids are being really supportive, and I think things are going even smoother than before. I wonder if I was trying too hard… I may have been too caught in the idea that I had to do everything myself. Ever since the incident… I feel like I can think about these things more calmly. You guys saw everything… Even the things I didn’t want to admit…

Yukiko Amagi: It still needs a few minutes.

Chie Satonaka: So, why’re we here…? Oh yeah, we were going to ask Yukiko what happened.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yukiko-san, I hate to brim to stuff you’d rather not think about… But I need to ask you again. Did you recall anything about when you got kidnapped?

Yukiko Amagi: I thought I might remember something if I let it sit for a while, but as time passes, it only gets hazier… I think… the doorbell rang at the entrance… and someone called for me… But when I woke us after that, I was already in the castle… I’m sorry.

Chie Satonaka: No need to apologize. But does this mean her visitor is the culprit!?

Yosuke Hanamura: I don’t know… If it’s true, then that’s one daring criminal. What kind of killer would ring the doorbell? The police are probably looking for witnesses… but I don’t think we can expect much from them. Heh, as if the culprit wore bright yellow clothes at the scene of the crime.

Chie Satonaka: I wonder why whoever it is would do stuff like this.

Yosuke Hanamura: But we can be sure of one thing. It’s no coincidence that people keep ending up in that place. Someone on our side is definitely kidnapping them and throws them into the TV. Oh yeah, we never told you. This guy and me are some catch the culprit ourselves! The police are out of their league on this case, but we got Personas.

”Never fear. We’ll get him.”
”Could you let us a hand?” ✔

Chie Satonaka: I’m helping out too! I can’t believe someone would throw people into a place like that. I’m gonna sock whoever’s doing this!

Yukiko Amagi: Chie… Let me help too. I want to know why this is happening. …Especially if someone hates me so much they want to kill me. I don’t want to run away from myself anymore.

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright! Then let’s all work together and catch this asshole!

Chie Satonaka: But how’re we going to find them? We don’t have a single lead yet.

Yukiko Amagi: I’m the third one to be targeted so far… But I have a feeling this isn’t the end of it. If we had an idea of who might be targeted next, wouldn’t we have an advantage over the killer?

Yosuke Hanamura: Okay, so let’s see if we can figure out what ties the victims together. First, there was that announcer, Mayumi Yamano. Second was Saki Konishi… Senpai. Third was Yukiko Amagi. What do they all have in common…?

”They all live in Inaba.”
”They’re all female.” ✔
”Nothing at all.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Bingo.

Chie Satonaka: How dare he target females! Now that’s unforgivable! The culprit’s gotta be some kinda pervert…

Yosuke Hanamura: Also, what about this? The second and third victims had some sort of connection to the first one.

Chie Satonaka: Hey, that’s right. Yukiko and Saki-senpai both had connections to that announcer…

Yukiko Amagi: Then… does that mean females connected in some way to Ms. Yamano’s case are being targeted…? I think that’s a safe assumption for now. There’s another angle we can take, too. If another person disappears…

Chie Satonaka: You think they’d be on that Midnight Channel? That happened right before Yukiko was kidnapped, too.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, it’s hard to tell who at first, but what’s important is, it’s happened before the victims disappeared. Kinda like a ransom note. We still don’t know why that happens, but we’ll have to rely on it for now. We still don’t know why that happens, but we’ll have to rely on it for now.

> It seems that the Midnight Channel is your only means of predicting who will be kidnapped next…

> You must remember to watch it on the next rainy night…

Yosuke Hanamura: By the way, aren’t those done by now?

Chie Satonaka: Whoa, that’s right! Chow time!

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, could I try just a little bit of that!? Just one tiny bite!

Chie Satonaka: Hands off the soba, pal! Go get your own if you want some. Rrrngh… Okay, just one bite, got it?

> The delicious aroma from the udon bowl is drifting your way…

Yukiko Amagi: Do you want to try some?

”Try some”
”Chow down” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: It’s soooo gooood… The aroma, the flavor, and the textile all combined… This is perfect!

> It’s too delicious to stop eating…

Chie Satonaka: Aaaack! What the hell are you doing!? You ate everything!

Yukiko Amagi: M-my fried tofu…

Chie Satonaka: I hope you guys understand what this means.

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Wait wait wait! Stool I’m sorry! I-I’ll buy you steak! It’ll be on me! Y-You hear me? The very best!

Chie Satonaka: Steak…?!

Yukiko Amagi: My tofu…

Chie Satonaka: C’mon, Yukiko. There’s steak in it for us now. We can eat instant noodles anytime we want. Right?

Yukiko Amagi: Well… as long as it isn’t too fatty.

Chie Satonaka: Okay, we’ve reached a verdict! You are hereby sentenced to buying us steak! What wouldn’t be too fatty? Filet? Ooh, filet sounds nice and expensive! Filet, filet, filet, filet mignon!

Yosuke Hanamura: (to Yu) Hey, you’ve gotta pony up too! You’re just as much to blame!

[Junes food court.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Man, talk about great timing. We just started serving grilled steak today. We’re doing our part to spread this town’s specialty dish. Plus, we’ve already got an excellent grill.

Chie Satonaka: That’s just a yakisoba griddle… Oh well, steak is steak. It’s far from a filet steak though… Yukiko, are you okay with this? It’s not too heavy for you?

Yukiko Amagi: I’ll eat it… I’m still mad.

Chie Satonaka: So, back on topic. I wonder what kind of person the culprit is.

Yosuke Hanamura: If you focus just on the announcer’s case, it seems like a revenge thins. Maybe it was her lover’s wife.

Chie Satonaka: But Misuzu Hiiragi had a solid alibi, didn’t she? And it seemed like she was already separated from her husband.

Yosuke Hanamura: Okay, what about the second case? Saki-senpai… she found the announcer’s body. Assuming the same person killed them both, then why target Senpai?

”It was a coincidence.”
”It was to shut her up.” ✔
”They knew each other.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, I think so too. Maybe she found a clue or something about the culprit.

Yukiko Amagi: But the killer just threw the announcer into a TV, right? I don’t think he would’ve left evidence the police--much less a high school student--would catch.

Tohru Adachi: Man, I thought the courtryside would be a snooze, but it’s proving to be a lot more exciting than I thought… Ooh, they updated the menu!

Chie Satonaka: Huh? Isn’t he that detective?

Tohru Adachi: Hey, you were at Dojima-san’s… Ahaha… I-I’m not… Oh, wait! Hey, this is great timing after all. Dojima-san said that he’ll be leaving work on schedule tonight. Could you pass that on to Nanako-chan? Yo! I’m Adachi, Dojima-san’s safer… Err, I mean, his partner.

Yosuke Hanamura: Are you this busy every day?

Tohru Adachi: Huh? Oh, well, the public seems to be getting a charge out of these cases, but we can’t leave it at that.

Chie Satonaka: Sorry to butt in, but could it be that the killer targeted Saki-senpai in order to silence her?

Tohru Adachi: U-Ummm, you sure get to the heart of the matter. Yikes… Haha. Of course, we’re also thinking along those lines. She was killed right after the announcer’s body was fond. If the killer was trying to silence her, there might’ve been something at the scene only she would have understood. Which would mean that the culprit may be someone close to Ms. Konishi. Nothing like that points to Misuzu Hiiragi, so… Ooh, I might have stumbled across something here… W-Wait, were you listening to all that!? Crap! Me and my big mouth… D-Don’t tell anyone I said any of that, or Dojima-san will flay me alive… Relax, kids, the police are on the job. See ya!

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* You were right, Yosuke. The police are totally useless… Augh! My steak’s getting cold!

Yosuke Hanamura: Could you shut up about steak for five seconds…?

> You waited for the two to finish eating then decided to go into the TV world.

Yukiko Amagi: Wow… This really is inside the TV… It’s Teddie… Then it wasn’t a dream.

Teddie: Are you feeling better, Yuki-chan? I did what you said! I’ve been a good bear!

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, I see… Good boy.

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Well, this bear’s part of the reason we want to find the culprit.

Yukiko Amagi: I’m one of the group now too. Let’s work together, okay?

Teddie: Yep! I was thinking the same thing! That’s why I got these ready for you, Yuki-chan!

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, so these are what everyone’s wearing. Thank you, Teddie. You’re right… It’s just as if the fog doesn’t exist…

Chie Satonaka: Hey, tell me something. How come you have so many pairs of glasses?

Teddie: Excellent question! Guess what? I’m the one who makes them. I’ve lived here for a long time. So I came up with some ways to be comfortable here.

Yukiko Amagi: I see. But don’t you need a pair?

Teddie: Oooh, good point. Another great question! Listen to this! My eyes themselves are lenses! You didn’t know?

Yosuke Hanamura: Of course not…

Teddie: Wh-Why are you being so mean? You act like you’re not interested! I’m a really dexterous bear! See how smoothly my fingers move!

> Teddie’s delicately moving his fingertips…

Yosuke Hanamura: What am I even looking at!? (punches Teddie)

Teddie: Ow!

Yukiko Amagi: Hm? You drop something…

Teddie: Oh, that’s a pair I kinda screwed up on.

[She wears this funny glasses with nose and mustaches…]

Yukiko Amagi: Oooh…

Chie Satonaka: Yukiko?

Yukiko Amagi: Ahaha, how do I look?

”Looks great.”
”It doesn’t fit you.”
””Looks natural on you.” ✔

Yukiko Amagi: Ahahaha! Awsome!

Teddie: Do you like that one, Yuki-chan?

Yukiko Amagi: I want to wear this one. It’s even got a nose guard!

Chie Satonaka: Ohhh no you don’t!

Teddie: How bear-y unfortunate… That pair doesn’t have the right lenses in. Guess I should’ve made an actual pair.

Yukiko Amagi: Aww , too bad. Here, Chie, your turn!

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* Man… All right, fine…

Yukiko Amagi: Snrk… Heehee…! Ahaha, ahahahahahaha!

Chie Satonaka: How’d it come to this…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-Yukoko-san? Helloo…?

Chie Satonaka: There goes one of Yukiko’s laughing fits… I never thought she’d do it when someone besides me was around. These stupid glasses are useless for investigating! I mean, what the hell’s this nose for, anyway!?

Teddie: Nice work, huh? That’s what happens when you guys leave me here alone and I get bored!

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Well, I’m glad that she’s in high spirits again… I guess…

Yukiko Amagi: Oh Chie, the look on you’ face… Snrk… Hahaha, it was so funny! I-I can’t stop… laugh-- Heehee! Ohhh, my staunch, ahaha…

> You decided to go back for today.

Ryotaro Dojima: I think I might be able to set the 4th and the 5th off.

Nanako Dojima: Really!? …Really?

Ryotaro Dojima: What, you don’t believe me?

Nanako Dojima: …It’s always canceled.

Ryotaro Dojima: N-Not every year… I know you wanted to go to Junes, but… I wouldn’t mind going a little further out of the neighborhood.

Nanako Dojima: Really? Can we go on a trip?

Ryotaro Dojima: Uhh… Well, it might be okay to go on a trip once in a while. I’m sure it’ll be crowded everywhere, though…

Nanako Dojima: Yaaay! We’re going on a trip!

Ryotaro Dojima: Hm… all right, all right. Then we need to think of someplace to so… How about you…? You wanna come along with us?

”I want to come.” ✔
”I’m not interested.”
”I’m not sure…”

Nanako Dojima: Yeah! Let’s all go together!

Ryotaro Dojima: Looks like Nanako wants us all to go.

> You’ll be going on an out with the Dojimas during the long holiday.

Nanako Dojima: Let’s bring boxed lunches!

Ryotaro Dojima: Hm? Yeah, good idea. We’re always eating side dishes for dinner. But I can’t cook… And Nanako’s not good enough yet to make them by herself… Well, it’ll work out. That’s what we’ve got this guy for, huh Nanako?

> You’ve been selected to pack the family’s boxed lunches…

Ryotaro Dojima: A vacation, huh… Should we make reservations now?

Nanako Dojima: Vacation, vacation! I can’t wait!

CHAPTER 13: Golden Week
> You have the day off from school today.

> You wonder if someone will show up on the Midnight Channel tonight…

> You can only wait and see.

> What should you do today?

Chie Satonaka: Oh, hello? It’s me, Chie. Do you have time to go inside the TV today? Now that Yukiko’s with us, I think it might be good for her to get some experience being in that place. Just give us a call if you want to go. See ya!

> You thought about exploring the TV world today.

> There is a bulletin board.

> There are several job openings posted.

> Which one do you want to read?

> You have taken the job constructing envelopes.

> You can make envelopes on the work desk in your room.

> Which one do you want to read?

Marie: I’ve been waiting for you. Hey, why don’t you take me somewhere? I don’t know the area. You know your way around here, right?

> It seems Marie wants to go out…

> You feel your relationship with Marie will deepen…

> Spend the day with Marie? YES/No

Marie: Today, I want to go to a lively place. I want to go to ”Joo-nes.” I heard about that place.

> It seems Marie wants to go to Junes.

> You decided to take Marie to Junes…

> Junes, Electronics department…

> You were dragged here by an excited Marie…

Marie: Hey, what happened just now? ”Time sale”…? Everyone was rushing to grab something called ”sallah drezzing”? Whatever it is, it must be worth fighting for.

Chie Satonaka: Hey, Yu-kun! What a coincidence! What are you doin’ here? Who’s this girl? She’s so cute.

”An acquaintance.”
”A friend” ✔
”This is Marie.”

Marie: Am I…? Well… whatever.

Chie Satonaka: Oh, er, so, can I ask for your name?

Marie: Huh? Oh, umm… Marie…

> Marie looks perplexed…

Chie Satonaka: Marie-chan, huh? Ooh, that’s a nice name… Oh, I’m Chie Satonaka. Nice to meet you!

Marie: Okay… (looks at a TV) I know what this is. It shows a lot of stuff.

Chie Satonaka: Oh, you came to look at the TVs, too? Yeah, I want one, too. We still haven’t replaced our old one.

Marie: I-I don’t want one! I don’t, but… Maybe… Can you turn it to ”StarScandalz”?

”So you DO want one.”
”Can you even watch it in that room?”
”What kind of show is that…?”

Marie: N-No I don’t! I just… was wondering how you’re supposed to watch it.

> Marie seems interested in the TV…

Marie: …So how do you watch it?

> You explain to Marie how to use a TV…

Chie Satonaka: Huh!? Are you one of those people who doesn’t watch TV!?

Marie: There isn’t one in the room.

Chie Satonaka: Really!? Wow… You must have super-strict parents. Girl, I don’t think I could stand it. Life without kung fu movies… Brr!

Marie: Oh… But there’s no ”eclectic loutwits” in that room. I’ll tell The Nose to install one of those ”eclectic loutwits.” There’s nothing to do in there…! (walk away)

Chie Satonaka: Hey, wait, Marie-chan!? …You don’t even have electricity in your room!?

> Junes, Food court…

> You came with Marie and Chie…

Chie Satonaka: Whew, that was the good stuff. Satisfaction! I haven’t had the steak here in a while, but it really isn’t all that bad. Marie-chan, you haven’t eaten at all. You, too, Yu-kun. You’ve gotta eat if you want to grow up big and strong. Just kidding, haha!

Marie: You eat too fast. …You’re gonna be fat one day.

Chie Satonaka: I didn’t need to hear that! Uh… I’ll go get us some drinks! …O-Oolong tea sands good.

Marie: …There’s a lot of people at this ”Joo-nes” place. Why? Don’t they have anything else to do? If they have TVs, they should be watching them instead of wasting time here.

Child: Morrmy, I’m thirsty! I wanna soda!

Mother: No, you just had one. You’ll have to wait.

Child: I wannit, I wannit!

Mother: I said no. You’ll rot your teeth.

> Marie watches the mother and son…

Marie: Hey… Do you think I was ever like that?

”Of course.” ✔
”You don’t remember?”

Marie: Yeah… There’s a lot I don’t remember… Everything…

> Marie looks serious…

Marie: I don’t remember anything. I was just walking… I had nowhere to go, and I just ended up in that room. Then Margaret told me to stay there. She also gave me the name ”Marie”… It’d be hard to get around without a name.

”That must be rough.” ✔
”You’re kidding me, right?”
”You can’t remember anything?”

Marie: I don’t know. I can’t even remember if it was tough. That’s okay… It’s not like it’s troubling me or anything.

> Despite her casual words, Marie has a concerned expression…

Marie: But… I don’t know why, but this town is familiar to me.

”Did you live here before?” ✔
”Do you remember anything else?”

Marie: The only thing I remember--or more like ”know”--is that this is mine.

> Marie is holding an old bamboo comb in her hand…

Marie: I had this from the start. …This is definitely mine. But so what? This doesn’t help anything…

> Marie confided in you about her memory…

> You feel your relationship with Marie has grown deeper…

> The Marie Social Link has reached level 2!

> Your power to create Personas of the Aeon Arcana has grown!

Marie: You’re searching for the ”truth,” right? …You should stop. There’s no such thing. …This conversation’s boring. Let’s talk about something else.

Chie Satonaka: Sorry to keep you waiting! The shop was busy, so I just ordered and came back here. They’ll bring it to us when it’s ready. …Uhh… Is it me, or is the mood a bit heavy around here? D-Don’t worry, you two! I ordered for all of us! …Oolong tea for everybody!

> After talking with Marie and Chie, you escort Marie back to the Velvet Room…

[The next day. School.]

Yukiko Amagi: Good morning! It’s raining… It’s not soils to last past nightfall, though. Every time it rained while I was ”over there,” you must have been… Oh, I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be gloomy. I know! Golden Week starts tomorrow, right? Do you have any plans?

”I’ll have a family outing.” ✔
”I’m going to Junes…”

Yukiko Amagi: I-I see. That must be tough. But, at least it looks like we’re going to have clear skies all week. It’d be nice if it could stay peaceful like this, but the mystery hasn’t been solved yet.

Mr. Morooka: I’m hearing a lot of chatter about Golden Week, but don’t forget that first and foremost, you’re students! Your duty is to study! You don’t have time to fool around, alright!? Do not misunderstand what freedom means! It does not mean that you can live without taking responsibility! Do not misunderstand what freedom means! It does not mean that you can live without taking responsibility! Even Pythagoras said, ”As soon as laws are necessary for men, they are no longer fit for freedom”! Next order of business! Midterms are coming up next week! The results will be posted to humiliate low-scoring losers! If you don’t want to be shamed, study hard! It’s that simple! If you do well, who knows!? You may become a more popular cretin! And you know, popularity leads to intimacy! On top of that, my reputation goes m. It’s a win-win situation, people! Like I said, study hard!

> You listened to the lecture intently…

> Your Knowledge has increased.

> Classes have ended for today.

> Will someone appear on the Midnight Channel again?

> You have no choice but to wait for another rainy night.

Timid female student: Hmm… That girl said that the cultural clubs are looking for new members. She was in the drama club, but she said that she was trying to get people to join the other clubs, too… Hmm… I’m sure you can find out more about it if you so to the faculty office. B-But you’d need to talk to Mr. Morooka… He’ll yell at you for sure! Ugh… Why does joining a club have to be so difficult…? Ah, um… I have something to ask you. Will you listen to me?

”What is it?”
”Not interested.”

Timid female student: To be honest… I haven’t been able to sleep lately. I’m afraid of so many things out there… But, if I had some sort of charm, I could calm down and actually rest… I think. Like an Angel Statue, or something… I get the feeling that it could protect me… Someone from the city like you should know where to get one of those, right? Someone from the city like you should know where to get one of those, right? O-Of course, I’ll repay you! Umm… How about I trade you my old good-luck charm for it? It’s a key. I don’t know what it’s a key TO, exactly, but it seems like It could be worth a lot.

”I’ll keep an eye out.”
”I’m busy.”✔

Timid female student: Oh, okay… *sign*

> This is the Chinese Diner, Aiya.

> After finishing you meal, you went home…

Announcer: An Inaba Credit Union ATM to the north of town was destroyed today by an earth mover, and all cash inside was stolen. The vehicle, which was abandoned at the scene, had been reported stolen by a local contractor. Since the culprit was able to act quickly before the security guards arrived on the scene, the police have…

Nanako Dojima: Dad’s late… Hello, Dad? Yeah, I’m okay. Yeah… yeah… Okay… AlrighHe said to give you the phone… He can’t take those days off.

Ryotaro Dojima: Hello? Sorry, but I’m going to be late tonight. Make sure you lock up before you go to sleep. And about that time off on the 4th and the 5th… One of the younger guys got sick… And, well, that case he’s handling, we can’t just let it sit… Looks like I’m the only one who can take over for him.

”That’s how it goes.”
”That sucks.”✔
”Poor Nanako…”

Ryotaro Dojima: Sorry to spring this on you all of a sudden… Um… How’s Nanako holding on? Would you mind comforting her for me? …Thanks. All right then, see you.

Nanako Dojima: Oh, good morning.

> Nanako is watching TV today, as usual.

> …It sounds like someone’s here…

> Chie came to see you.

Chie Satonaka: Hey, if you’re free today, wanna go somewhere? Yukiko’s coming, too. How ’bout you, Nanako-chan? Wanna come?

Nanako Dojima: U-mm…

”Yeah, come with us.”✔
”Would you rather watch TV?”

Nanako Dojima: Huh? I-I can come?

Chie Satonaka: Of course you can!

> You decided to take Nanako out along with Chie and the others.

> Junes food court…

> You met up with Yosuke, who’s still on the clock, and Yukiko, who finished her work back at the inn.

Yosuke Hanamura: Why’d you bring poor Nanako-chan to a place like this on Golden Week?

Chie Satonaka: Where else is there to go?

Nanako Dojima: I love Junes!

Yosuke Hanamura: N-Nanako-chan…!

Nanako Dojima: But we were supposed to go on a real trip somewhere. We were going to make boxed lunches…

Yukiko Amagi: Wow! You can make boxed lunches, Nanako-chan?

Chie Satonaka: Oh, so you’re the family cook? Pretty impressive, ”big bro”!

Nanako Dojima: Big… bro.

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa, you can cook? Well, you do seem to be great with you’ hands-- Um, never mind.

Chie Satonaka: I-I’m a pretty good cook too, you know… Probably. If you’d asked, I would’ve whipped up some boxed lunches. Easy as pie! Yeah…

Yosuke Hanamura: Ohh, let me think about--No.

Chie Satonaka: What makes you think I can’t cook!? Let’s have a cook-off and see for ourselves!

Yosuke Hanamura: My, my, doth the lady protest too much? And hey, I never said I cooked. But I have this weird feeling… Like I’d win anyway…

Yukiko Amagi: Ahaha, I can understand that.

Chie Satonaka: What the-- Yukiko!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Here, Nanako-chan can be on judge. I bet we’ll make something that ranks up there with your mom’s cooking. Nanako-chan!

Nanako Dojima:  I don’t have a mom. She died in an accident.

Chie Satonaka: Hey, Yosuke…

Yosuke Hanamura: I-I see… Um… Sorry, I didn’t know…

Nanako Dojima:  It’s okay. Even if I don’t have a mom, I have Dad with me.  …And now I have a brother, too.  And I’m having a lot of ﬁn today! I love Junes!

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-Yeah? That’s good.

Chie Satonaka: We’ll play with you anytime you want, Nanako-chan!

Yukiko Amagi: Yeah, we should hang out more often.

Yosuke Hanamura: C’mon, Nanako-chan. Let’s go set a soda!

Nanako Dojima: Okay!

Yukiko Amagi: She’s a strong girl…

Chie Satonaka:  Yeah. She makes me feel like I’m the little kid here.  That’s it, I’m gonna go get something for Nanako-chan too!

Nanako Dojima: Today was fun, huh?

> Today is Nature Day, so you have the day off from school.

> You wonder when it’ll rain at night again…

> What should you do today?

Yosuke Hanamura:  Yo, it’s me! This might be kind of weird to ask after we hung out yesterday, but do you wanna hang out again today?  I’ll see if I can find someone else to come along with us.

”Sure.”
”Check Social Link rank”
”I’ll pass.”✔

Yosuke Hanamura:  I see… I was thinking we could hang out with Nanako-chan, but I know it’ll be annoying if I keep asking you guys to do stuff. See ya later.

> Yosuke hung up. 

[Shopping District.]

Chie Satonaka:  Oh, Yu-kun… Don’t you think this is cool?  That shine, those caves… Man, I want that helmet.

Chie Satonaka: Hm? Training, of course!

Nanako Dojima: Training… Who are you fighting with, Chie?

Chie Satonaka: Hmm… Myself… I guess…? Heheh, just kidding!

Nanako Dojima: Wow, cool!

Chie Satonaka: Y-You think…? Hahaha…

Nanako Dojima: …Oh, a grasshopper!

Chie Satonaka: Huh!? N-No way! Wh-Where!?

Nanako Dojima: It just landed on you’ back.

Chie Satonaka: Ahhhhh! Get it off! Get it off me!

> Nanako took the grasshopper off Chie’s back.

Nanako Dojima: …You don’t like grasshoppers?

Chie Satonaka:  I’m no good with anything with thin, jointed legs! Or anything creepy or squirmy!  Ack, now I can’t get ’em out of my mind! I can’t stand those things!

Nanako Dojima: But they’re cute…

Chie Satonaka: …You’re like Yukiko. Oh, see, ‘cause Yukiko’s fine around bugs. But me, I totally lose it…  Kinda funny, huh?
”It’s cute.”
”It’s very feminine.”✔
”It’s hilarious.”

Chie Satonaka: Th-That’s not true! It’s not…

> Somehow, Chie looks happy.

Nanako Dojima:  A lot of kids in my class don’t like bugs. It’s not just you. Don’t worry!

Chie Satonaka:  Nanako-chan… Ooh, you don’t know how happy that makes me. Thanks! C’mon, you wanna train too?

Nanako Dojima: Okay!

Chie Satonaka:  Let’s start with form. I’ll teach you a kata…

> Chie and Nanako began training…

> …You sent Nanako home before it got dark.

Chie Satonaka:  I’m gonna get over my fear of bugs. I don’t wanna look like a sissy next to Nanako-chan!  All I have to do is think of them as Shadows! Then I’ll be able to grab a whole fistful! I-I just gave myself gooseburns…  G-Getting used to buss might take a while, but I won’t lose to Shadows!

> You felt Chie’s burning passion…

> You feel your relationship with Chie has grown yet deeper…

> The Chie Satonaka Social Link has reached level 3!

> Your power to create Personas of the Chariot Arcana has grown!

> Chie’s determination in battle has been enhanced…

> Chie can now perform a follow-up attack during battle!

> After finishing your training, you walked partway home with Chie.

CHAPTER 14: All Your Yens Yip Yip Yah
[Shrine in Shopping District.]

> There’s no one on the premises…

> The dusty shrine doesn’t seem to be well-maintained…

> ……

> You decided to go home.

> You sense someone watching you…

Strange animal: ……

> A mysterious fox suddenly appears before you…!

> Does it live at the shrine…?

> The fox is staring at you…

> You notice an ”ema” plaque in its mouth…

> The mysterious fox nudges the ema into your hand.

> It reads: ”Please help Grandpa’s legs get better. -Keita”

> The ema has someone’s wish written on it…

> Why did the fox give this to you…?

> Upon closer inspection, you notice an unusually shaped leaf stuck on the back of the ema.

> You don’t recognize this leaf from the local plant life…

> Is this also the work of the mysterious fox…?

Old man: Oh, not every day you see young’uns like you around here. Nobody lives here anymore. I come by to tidy things up once in a while, but lately my legs are so achy, I just can’t do it. I’ve been tryin’ to get this place up to snuff, but there just isn’t enough money to go around. Well, I s’pose I’ll pay my respects. If my legs don’t heal, I can’t maintain the shrine. That, and… I won’t be able to visit Keita anymore. He’s my grandson, y’know.

> You wonder if it could be the same Keita who wrote the ema…

> The ema said, ”Please help Grandpa’s legs get better…”

Old man: Hmm!? What’s that you got in your hand there? Could it be…!? That leaf…! That’s it! Way back when, my grandmother always used to say a leaf shaped like that was the best kind of ache remedy out there! Ah, what memories! But how’d you get your hands on this!? I didn’t think you could find those in the mountains anymore. P-Please, young man! Can I trouble you to spare me that leaf!?

> You gave the old man the leaf that was stuck to the back of the ema.

Old man: Ooh, this is it, this is it… Now let’s see here…

> The old man stuck the leaf onto his leg…

Old man: Oooh, I can feel it! It’s working! Amazing! The pain I’ve been feeling for who knows how long--it just up and vanished! Hm…? Hrmmm…!? Why, I feel better than I have in years! You really helped me out, young man! I’m so grateful! Now I can go visit my grandson! I’d better pay thanks to the shrine for bringing us together like this!

> You marvel at the amazing results…

> Not only did it heal his aches, it even restored his vitality…

> The fox looks on from his hiding place with a contented expression…

> It seems to understand that the wish on the ema has been granted…

> The fox is peering into the offertory box as if to check the contents…

> It even seems to understand that the shrine has received an offering…

> ……

> Perhaps you were given the ema with the leaf for that express purpose…

Fox: *yip*

> It seems it has taken a liking to you…

> It has a mouthful of the same leaves as the one you gave to the old man…

> It seems the fox has a large stock of mysterious leaves with healing powers.

Fox: *yip*

> The fox is looking up mirthfully…

> Is there something it wants from you?

> You cannot help but think how strange an encounter this is, as you realize a fox is showing you a pile of leaves…

> You feel a faint bond forming between you and the fox…

> Where does it find such amazing leaves…?

> You reflect on how useful it would be to have this kind of help while searching the ”other side”…

> ……

Fox: *yip*

> Does it understand your thoughts…?

> The fox gestures toward the offertory box…

> Is it offering its services for a price…?

Fox: *yip*

> It seems the mysterious fox has agreed to aid you in your search…

> However, it appears that it will require a fee for its cooperation…

> You returned the ema to the shrine and went home.

> It’s getting late.

> You decided to go home…

[At Dojima’s.]

Announcer: The prime suspect in yesterday’s ATM robbery in northern Inaba was arrested earlier today. The alleged thief is Pumena Sushin, a 26-year-old former employee of the company which reported the stolen vehicle. According to the police investigation, Pumena Sushin was…

Ryotaro Dojima: I’m home. *sigh* How many days is he gonna call in sick? These rookies lately sure are--

Nanako Dojima: Welcome back!

Ryotaro Dojima: Nanako… I’m sorry I broke my promise again…

Nanako Dojima: Oh, um, my big bro and his friends played with me instead.

Ryotaro Dojima: I see… Thanks.

Nanako Dojima: Oh, that’s a Junes bag! What’s in it?

Ryotaro Dojima: Haha, good eye. Well, today is Children’s Day… So I brought you a present.

Nanako Dojima: Yaaaay! Oooh, a t-shirt.

Ryotaro Dojima: Haha, it took me a while to decide what to get you. You like it?

Nanako Dojima: Oh wow, there’s a picture on the front! That’s so funny! Ahaha, yay!

Ryotaro Dojima: I got you one, too. Not that you’re still a child or anything, but fair’s fair.

> …It’s a swimsuit with an odd design on it.

”Thank you.”✔
”……”

Ryotaro Dojima: Don’t mention it. I thought you might need one soon. Well then… let’s eat.

Nanako Dojima: Okay!

> You spent a pleasant evening with the Dojimas.

[The next day. Road to school. Yosuke ride his bicycle.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Yo! Dammit, I just fixed this thing… It’s making squeaking sounds again.

”Maybe it’s karma.”
”It sure is noisy.”
”Maybe you need a new one…”✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Yeah… Hey, by the way… I’m sorry about the other day… You know, about what I said to Nanako-chan. After hanging out with Nanako-chan… I feel even stronger that we have to solve this case.

”Thanks.”
”We’ll do our best.”
”I’m counting on you.”✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Hehe… Same to you! Y’know, Chie and Yukiko seem different lately… They’re a lot closer. Oh yeah, I was just curious, but are you… Ehh, never mind. If we keep chatting, we’re gonna be late. *sigh* Man, school’s such a chore. And now my bike’s messed up too… The roads are much wider here than in the city, so I keep speeding… I guess that did it. *sigh* Oh well. Until I get my motorcycle license, I’ll just have to walk.

[In the classrom.]

Chie Satonaka: Ugh… Why do the holidays have to end so fast…?

Yosuke Hanamura: At least they were peaceful. I listened in on the housewives gossiping at Junes, but it doesn’t seem like anything happened. And I haven’t heard anything about someone disappearing suddenly, either… Y’think Yukiko could’ve been the last of the victims?

”She’s probably the last one.”
”I doubt this is over.”✔

Chie Satonaka: Hmm…

Yukiko Amagi: I don’t know. But we shouldn’t relax as long as the culprit remains at large.

Yosuke Hanamura: I wonder… Will someone show up on TV again if it rains? If we only knew a little more about who the killer might be…

Chie Satonaka: Eh, it’s no good fretting over it now. If someone does show up on the Midnight Channel, then we’ll deal with it. It’s supposed to start raining soon, but I hope this weather holds through next week… You know… Midterms…

Yosuke Hanamura: Ugh, you had to go and bring that up… I don’t wanna think about it.

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* I wish I had Yukiko’s gift for studying… Hey Yosuke, why don’t you have Yukiko go over some of the material with you?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hm? Oh, that’s right. Yukiko’s ranked at the top on every exam. Maybe I should ask her for some private lessons.

Yukiko Amagi: P-Private lessons!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? What’s wrong? Ow…! What was that for? I’m just asking you to help me study…

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, I’m sorry… You were talking about studying… I thought it might’ve been an off-color joke. Our inn has had some strange visitors lately…

Yosuke Hanamura: If you thought it was a joke, then just shrug it off!

Yukiko Amagi: Sorry. My hand moved without thinking…

Yosuke Hanamura: Geez… Thanks a lot, Chie, for bringing up the whole studying thing.

Chie Satonaka: Wh-What did I do!? You’re the one who made it sound creepy and wrong! ”Private lessons,” huh?

Yosuke Hanamura: Wha--Then it’s mostly my fault!?

Yukiko Amagi: Oh… I should start heading home.

> Classes have ended for today.

[Evening.]

Ryotaro Dojima: We haven’t had time to talk like this since you got here, huh?

> Dojima is desperately casting about for a topic to discuss…

Ryotaro Dojima: Uhhh… Well, how’s school?

”It’s fun.” ✔
”Meh…”
”It’s boring.”

Ryotaro Dojima: I see… That’s good to hear. Your school days will be over before you know it. Make sure you have fun while you can.

> Dojima is nodding to himself.

Ryotaro Dojima: What else…? Oh, yeah… How about your friends? Looks like you’ve made plenty of ’em.

> Dojima is scowling…

Ryotaro Dojima: I’m not saying who you can and can’t hang out with, but… You know what I’m talking about, right?

”Yes.” ✔
”No.”
”Say it straight out.”

Ryotaro Dojima: Huh. So you did notice…

> Dojima is nodding.

Ryotaro Dojima: For some reason, wherever there’s an incident, there you are… I wish I didn’t have to consider this, but… the killings began around the time you came to town. My job is all about eliminating the random element. I look only at the facts. If you keep getting caught up in my job, then…

Nanako Dojima: …What’s wrong? Big bro didn’t do anything bad.

Ryotaro Dojima: I-I know. I didn’t mean it like that.

Nanako Dojima: But you’re bullying him…

Ryotaro Dojima: I’m not bullying him. We were just having a little talk.

Ryotaro Dojima: It’s getting late… Go to sleep.

Nanako Dojima: …Okay.

Ryotaro Dojima: Sheesh… She’s really taking a shine to you. Look… Just don’t get yourself involved in anything dangerous. As long as you’re safe, everything’s fine. Your parents didn’t ask me to raise your grades or anything.

> It seems Dojima is genuinely worried about you.

> You feel a faint bond forming between you and Dojima…

Ryotaro Dojima: Things here might be a little different from what you’re used to, but this is a good town. Though it’s a little dangerous right at the moment… Now then, it’s about time for you to turn in. Get some sleep. ’Night.

[The next day. School.]

Female student: Mr. Hosoi? Have you picked up the latest edition of ”Bullied Teacher” yet?

Mr. Hosoi: Of course I did. But it’s raining today. I hope I can get it home without getting it all wet…

Female student: So, uh, does anyone have an extra book cover they’d be kind enough to lend me?

Mr. Hosoi: …Whoops, I have to start the lecture! Don’t try to distract me by talking about books! Today, we’re going to discuss ”Kokoro” by Soseki Natsume. Open your textbooks. Before we get to the actual literature, I’ll ask a question about Soseki himself. Hmm, how about Yu-chan, the city boy. Do you know how Soseki Natsume translated the English phrase ”I love you” into Japanese?

”’I love you.’”
”’I could die.’”
”’I love thee.’”
”’The moon is beautiful, isn’t it?’”✔

Mr. Hosoi: Oh, you’re very knowledgeable. Yep, he translated it as, ”The moon is beautiful, isn’t it?” By the way, the person who translated it as ”I could die” was Shimei Futabatei, another prominent Meiji-era writer. Though he translated it from Russian, not English… It’s still similar in that they didn’t do direct translations. Back then, in Japan there wasn’t the same direct expression of love that we have now, so they had to get creative. It’s a subtle, endearing translation, much like the Japanese language itself. Anyway, let’s get back into ”Kokoro.”

[After school.]

> You hear thunder rumbling…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey Chie, I bought you a new copy of that ”Trial of the Dragon” flick. It was a Greatest Punches version for 980 yen. If I knew then, I’d have just replaced it instead of buying you grilled steak.

Chie Satonaka: This is clearly getting closer…!

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh…? What are you, scared of a little lightning?

Chie Satonaka: Quiet, you! I’d be a goner if even one of those things hit me! Eek!

Yosuke Hanamura: Hahaha, you’re freakin’ out way too much. C’mon, shouldn’t weather like this help with your kung fu training? A bolt of lightning would hit and it’d give you the inspiration for a new move! There was a scene like that in your DVD, wasn’t there?

Chie Satonaka: You jerk! You don’t even care how I feel! If lightning has to strike someone, let it be this guy!

Yukiko Amagi: Huh? Is this a blackout?

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s what you get for saying that stuff, Chie. …Looks like I better hurry up and head to work. Depending on how produce sells today, I might get a little bonus in my pay for the week. This weather may keep customers away, but I gotta do my best if I’m gonna save up for a motorcycle! It’s from my manager… Hello?

Man’s voice: Yosuke-kun? Hmmm… some of the power in the store is out after that lightning strike. Could you come in early today? All the refrigerated shelves have stopped running. It’s looking like we’ll have to close up the produce section early today.

Yosuke Hanamura: Wait, what!? But my pay…

Man’s voice: Anyway, I need you here to help deal with this mess. I’m counting on you! Goodbye!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wai--

Chie Satonaka: What’re you looking at me for!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Ugh, why did this have to happen!?

Chie Satonaka: Hey, Yukiko… can we just go home?

Yukiko Amagi: Chie, do you know this story? A girl forgot her homework, so she snuck into school in the middle of the night, but she suddenly needed to use the bathroom… She ventured into the girls’ room, where all the lights were off. No one should have been there, but in the mirror…

Chie Satonaka: Hold it right there! What’re you talking about!?

Yukiko Amagi: Huh? It’s a ghost story. I thought you liked them.

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, but why tell it now!?

> Chie’s on the verge of tears. What should you do…?

Tell her another ghost story
Lightly tap Chie’s back
Comfort her ✔

Chie Satonaka: Thanks… I’m glad you’re here…

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* Why don’t you just have him escort you back home, Chie?

Chie Satonaka: Oh, the power’s back! C’mon, Yukiko, let’s go home!

> Chie and Yukiko leave in a hurry…

Chie Satonaka: A-Are you making fun of me!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, yeah. With how freaked out you are, can you blame me?

[At Dojima’s]

> Evening…

> There are red origami flowers on the table…

Nanako Dojima: Hmm…

> Nanako seems to be lost in thought…

Ask her what’s wrong✔
Wait for her to speak up

> You ask her what’s wrong…

Nanako Dojima: Um, well…

> Nanako fidgets.

Nanako Dojima: I made flowers at school yesterday. They said today is ”Mother’s Day.” My teacher told us that’s a day when you give your mom flowers. I don’t have a mom… so I don’t know what to do with these flowers.

> Nanako seems upset…

”You can give them to her.”✔
”Let’s give them to your dad.”
”Give them to me.”

Nanako Dojima: Huh…? Oh, you mean the family altar!? Dad always puts food there. He said it gets to Mom in heaven. Do you think my flowers will get to her too? I did a really good job on mine! My teacher said they were pretty too! I wonder if my mom will be happy to get them.

> Nanako seems happy…

Nanako Dojima: You should make a flower too, big bro! Then we can celebrate Mother’s Day together!

> Nanako taught you how to make an origami flower…

Nanako Dojima: We did it!

> You placed the finished flower on the family altar.

> It’s getting late, so you put Nanako to bed and head back to your room…
> Your room…

> Yosuke pretty much barged in…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hmmmm, it’s pretty clean. So…? You keep the goods under your futon?

”Of course.” ✔
”Huh?”
”What, don’t you?”

Yosuke Hanamura: Hahaha! Why are you acting so dignified about it? Alright, I’ll check ’em out when you go take a piss or something. I’ll expose your embarrassing tastes!!

> Yosuke looks like he’s having fun.

Yosuke Hanamura: So, you ever invited a girl in here?

”I have.”
”I haven’t.”
”I will soon.” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Seriously!? That mean you’re working on someone!?

> Yosuke is keyed up…

Nanako’s voice: Are you up there? Have you seen the public notice anywhere?

Yosuke Hanamura: Nanako-chan’s here? Let’s let her in. Nanako-chan, are you free today?

Nanako Dojima: No, I’m going to Takeyoshi-kun’s house with Miwa-chan and Yo-chan.

Yosuke Hanamura: A-A guy’s house!?

Nanako Dojima: Takeyoshi-kun sits next to me. I’m going to deliver the public notice to him. Miwa-chan said she’s going with me because she likes Takeyoshi-kun.

Yosuke Hanamura: Because she likes him…? M-Man, kids sure are mature these days… Well, my first love was in first grade, too! I’ve always been ahead of my time. But, well… I don’t really need that in my life right now. It’s just not the time… I have something I need to do before that can happen…

Nanako Dojima: Homework?

Yosuke Hanamura: No… Well, maybe it is. You’re smart, Nanako-chan!

> Nanako left for her friend’s house…

Yosuke Hanamura: Nanako-chan called it ”homework”… But do we have anything left to do? I don’t really know, but the case seems closed… Is it okay to end it there…? Oh… sorry. That sounded weird, huh? But… We might still have to use our power to uncover the truth… So let’s hang in there. Nanako-chan called it ”homework”… Catching the killer, ending the murders, bringing peace to the town… Only we can do it, huh? Let’s hang in there. I’m counting on you. To tell you the truth… I’m not that interested. I don’t know what it’s like to fall in love… I’ve got enough to worry about without that stuff. Now isn’t the time… I have things I need to do before that can happen… Or… More like we do. Let’s hang in there. I’m counting on you.

> Yosuke’s determination shows through…

> You sense Yosuke’s trust…

> The Yosuke Hanamura Social Link has reached level 5!

> Your power to create Personas of the Magician Arcana has grown!

> Yosuke can now cure severe ailments during battle! 

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, so did the notice reach you yet? The one about joining the young men’s association. They were talking about having some kind of event to boost the economy. Junes is involved with it, so they’re trying to rope me in. I don’t have time for that… I told ’em I was busy, but they keep dogging me. I don’t care about the young men’s association or about boosting the economy…

> Yosuke sighs…

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright, time to take a peek under the futon!

> You talked with Yosuke about different things…

> ……

> It has gotten dark, so you said goodbye to Yosuke…

> You were familiar with every question.

Yosuke Hanamura: It’s finally over. Whewwww! What a load off! I bet every student feels like this after exams are over!

Chie Satonaka: Hey, quiet down! So, what did you write for number seven? The one about what ”that” referred to in the sentence.

Yukiko Amagi: Um… I put ”her sorrowful expression.”

Chie Satonaka: Oh crap, then I got it wrong! I put, ”the rice cakes on top of the table.”

Yukiko Amagi: Rice cakes…? Wait, was that what the story was about…?

Chie Satonaka: Alright, I’m giving up on composition. I’m gonna bet it all on geography! What did you choose for the tallest mountain in the solar system?

”Olympus Mons.”✔
”Mt. Maxwell.”
”Mt. Everest.”

Chie Satonaka: Oh, seriously!? I chose the wrong one…

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, I put that one too.

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa, you too!? Then it’s probably the right answer… *sigh* Boy, I can’t wait for our grades to be posted out in the hall where everyone can see ’em. Geez…

Knowledgeable student: Hey, did you hear? A TV station’s filming here in town.

Student’s friend: They’re probably just doing more stuff about that hanging corpse case.

Knowledgeable student: No, it’s not that. You know the highway nearby? They’re gonna cover those biker gangs that hang around there. A friend of mine goes to the biker meetings sometimes. I heard it from him.

Student’s friend: Dude, what’re you doing hanging out with a guy in a biker gang? Well, anyways… Whaddya think about tomorrow’s group blind date? We were gonna meet outside, but… It’s gonna rain soon, right? Won’t it be better to play it safe tomorrow too?

Yukiko Amagi: Biker gang?

Chie Satonaka: Oh yeah… They raise a ruckus from time to time. I guess your place is too far away to hear ’em.

Yosuke Hanamura: We live right by the road. The noise can drive you insane.

Chie Satonaka: I hear some guys at this school are part of it, too.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, I know there are some rumors about a first-year student here who’s a total hellraiser. One of the guys working at Junes said the dude’s been a legend ever since middle school. Although… Was he in a biker gang…?

Yukiko Amagi: D-Did you say he was a legend?

Chie Satonaka: Uh, it’s not what you think, Yukiko…

[Couple of days later. Dojima’s home. The whole family eat and watch TV.]

Narrator: Young men recklessly riding their motorcycles, disturbing the peace of a quiet rural town… Our special report took a turn for the violent when one of the apparent leaders attacked the camera crew!

Young delinquent: The hell are you punks doing here!?

Ryotaro Dojima: That voice…

Young delinquent: This ain’t a show! Get bent!

Ryotaro Dojima: Still up to the same old tricks…?

Nanako Dojima: Do you know him, Dad?

Ryotaro Dojima: Mmm, well, I know him through work. His name’s Kanji Tatsumi… He’s quite a handful. He’s been crushing biker gangs in the area since middle school. But I thought he got into a high school and started attending class…

Nanako Dojima: Huh.

Ryotaro Dojima: Man, that blur sure is pointless. It’s completely obvious who it is. The guy’s family runs a historic textile shop. I think what happened was, he crushed the local bikers all by himself because the noise kept his mother up at night. It’s a nice gesture, but he’s way too violent… At this rate, his mother’ll have to apologize again.

Nanako Dojima: Oh, the weather report’s showing on the bottom. It’s going to rain tomorrow. I’ll make sure to hang the laundry inside the house.

May 14th, 2011. Saturday. School.
Chie Satonaka: Whoa, it started raining… I guess the weather report was right.

Yosuke Hanamura: That means that show’s probably gonna be on tonight.

Yukiko Amagi: I hope we don’t see anyone…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, that’d be best. But if we do, maybe we’ll see some kinda clue that can point us toward the killer…

Chie Satonaka: Well everyone, don’t forget to check your TV tonight! Got it?

> It seems to be another rainy night.

> What will you see on the Midnight Channel tonight…?

[Evening. Your room at Dojima’s]

> It’s raining tonight.

> Will something appear on TV…?

> …A figure appeared!

> It seems to be a man…

> He looks like a high schooler…

> ……

> The image is unfocused, and it’s hard to tell who it is…

> Should you try calling Yosuke…?

Call Yosuke✔
Wait until tomorrow

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, it’s you! I was just about to call your cell! So, what do you think? That was a guy, wasn’t it? I wish I could tell what he looked like… Let’s get together and talk more about it tomorrow!

> You hung up.

> You decide to go to bed for tonight.

May 15th, 2011. Sunday. Junes.
Yosuke Hanamura: Ahem, we will now hold a meeting on our investigation of the serial kidnapping- slash-murder case here in Inaba.

Chie Satonaka: Dude, take a breath!

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, then does that make this place our special headquarters?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yes! Exactly! Nicely put, Yukiko.

Chie Satonaka: Special headquarters… Hmm, that does have a nice ring to it…

Yosuke Hanamura: Anyways, as for what was on last night…

”Did you watch last night?”
”Who was that?”✔

Chie Satonaka: I saw it too!

Yukiko Amagi: So that’s how I looked on TV… Hm? Wait a moment. Didn’t all the victims have one thing in common? That they were females with ties to the first incident?

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s what we thought… But we still don’t know who exactly we saw.

Yukiko Amagi: In my case, the image on the Midnight Channel changed after I was kidnapped, right?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, the screen got clear all of a sudden and the program looked like some low-budget TV show. Come to think of it, maybe Teddie was right… Maybe we were seeing the other Yukiko from that world.

Yukiko Amagi: But last night, we couldn’t clearly see whoever it was. Could that mean… he isn’t inside the TV yet? If so, then…

”He’s still safe for now.”✔
”He’s already kidnapped.”

Yukiko Amagi: Uh-huh, I think that’s safe to assume.If we can figure out who he is, can we prevent him from being taken?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah… And if all goes well, we might catch the killer in the bargain. *sigh* But to do that, we need to know who the latest Midnight Channel star is… I hate to say it, but I guess we’ll have to wait another night and see what happens.

Chie Satonaka: Ahehem… Well, that means if my deductions are correct… Though the image was hard to make out, and we can’t say for sure who it was, it was definitely a young male. But if that’s the case, it goes entirely against our prior assumptions… Since we cannot identify the person at this time, we have no choice but to wait and see what happens!

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s exactly what we just said.

Chie Satonaka: Shut up!

Yukiko Amagi: *chuckle* Heehee, aha, ahahahaha! You’re so funny, Chie! Ahahaha, oh no! M-My funny bone…!

Chie Satonaka: Not again…

Yukiko Amagi: S-Sorry, heeheehee!

Yosuke Hanamura: This is how Yukiko really is, huh… Who’d have thought?

Chie Satonaka: By the way, about that guy we saw? I get the feeling I’ve seen him before… Pretty recently, too…

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, you too? Yeah, I’ve been thinking the same thing since last night… Well, let’s check the TV again tonight and think about it more tomorrow.

Yukiko Amagi: Heehee…

Chie Satonaka: Grrr, when are you gonna stop that, you crazy hyena!?

Yukiko Amagi: Ahahaha! That’s a good one, Chie!

[Evening. Dojima’s.]

> It’s raining tonight.

> Will something appear on TV…?

> …A figure appeared!

> The image is unfocused…

> But you feel like you’ve seen him before…

> …It’s from Yosuke.

Yosuke Hanamura: Did you see that?

”It might be Kanji Tatsumi…”✔
”I don’t know who it was.”

Yosuke: Yeah, I think so too. I knew I saw him somewhere! It was on TV! He was on that special news report! He’s one scary dude. He was even yelling at the camera to ”Get bent!” Alright, so we finally have a lead. Let’s all get together tomorrow, okay? Oh, I almost forgot… It’s kinda off- subject, but as long as you’re on the line, mind if I ask something? It’s something I’ve been meaning to ask for a while. So… what do you think about Yukiko and Chie? I mean, let’s not mince words: Which one’s your type?

”Chie.”
”Yukiko.”
”Both.”
”Neither.”✔

> You told Yosuke your true feelings.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hahaha! Kinda harsh, don’tcha think? Well, I kinda understand. They’re great girls, but you saw their ugly sides right off, and I guess your first impression is the one that sticks. Hey, but don’t worry. This is just between you and me. Okay, see you tomorrow.

> Yosuke hung up.

May 16th, 2011. Monday. School.
Chie Satonaka: The one who was on last night… It’s THAT guy, right…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Kanji Tatsumi, huh? He definitely didn’t look like the social type.

Chie Satonaka: Now there’s an understatement. Isn’t he really scary? Did you see the news special the other day?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, I saw it.

Yukiko Amagi: You mean the special on biker gangs? I watched it too. He wasn’t like that when he was younger, though…

Chie Satonaka: You know him, Yukiko?

Yukiko Amagi: Uh-huh, but we haven’t talked to each other in a long time. His family runs a textile shop, and we’ve been a customer of theirs for many years. So I speak with Kanji-kun’s mother from time to time. Oh, why don’t we go there now? We might be able to talk to him in person.

Chie Satonaka: Sounds good. At the very least, we can ask if anything strange has come up lately. I wouldn’t want to run into him in a dark alley, but I’m pretty sure he won’t fly off the handle at his family’s store.

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright, then let’s get going.

Chie Satonaka: If things get rough, we’re counting on you guys!

> You decided to go to Kanji Tatsumi’s house to have a chat with him.

Yukiko Amagi: Hello.

Shop owner: Ah, Yuki-chan. It’s so nice to see you.

Slender young man: Well then, if you’ll excuse me, Ma’am.

Shop owner: I’m sorry that I couldn’t help more.

Slender young man: It’s all right; you’ve given me plenty to think about. Thank you.

Yosuke Hanamura: What’s up with him…? Weirdo.

Chie Satonaka: I ’unno. Never seen him before.

Shop owner: Yuki-chan, you’re as lovely as always. Your features are starting to remind me of your mother when she was young. How can I help you today? Are you out shopping with your friends?

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, um, well… actually…

Chie Satonaka: Hey, this scarf… I’ve seen this somewhere before…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hm? Oh, you’re right. Where was that…?

Chie Satonaka: Oh! It was that place! Inside the TV!

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s right! That room with those faceless posters… Then… it’s that announcer’s…

Shop owner: Are you acquaintances of Ms. Yamano?

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh, well, kinda…

Yosuke Hanamura: Um… Did Ms. Yamano happen to have a scarf like this?

Shop owner: Yes, it was a special order she placed. She actually ordered a pair, but in the end, she said she only wanted the women’s scarf. It left us with no choice but to sell this one separately.

Chie Satonaka: Oh man… There IS a connection to the first case…! What are we gonna do…?

Yosuke Hanamura: H-How should I know…?

Deliveryman: Hello! Delivery here for the Tatsumis.

Shop owner: Oh, I’ll be right there. I’m sorry, you’ll have to excuse me.

Chie Satonaka: Oh, it’s okay. We should get going.

Yukiko Amagi: I’ll come again, Ma’am.

Shop owner: Is that so? Well, then please say hello to your mother for me.

Yosuke Hanamura: It really is connected to the first case after all… But it’s just a scarf. Would the killer target someone just because of that…? Dammit, what’s going on…? C’mon, let’s talk outside.

[They leave the shop.]

Yukiko Amagi: Huh…? It’s Kanji-kun.

Yosuke Hanamura: Wha--Quick, hide!

Chie Satonaka: You’re not fooling anyone, you know…

Yosuke Hanamura: Shhh! I can’t hear what they’re saying!

> You eavesdropped on Kanji’s conversation with the boy…

Kanji Tatsumi: T-Tomorrow’s fine with me… Huh? S-School? ’Course I’m going to school…

Slender young man: Then I’ll meet you at the gates after school tomorrow.

Kanji Tatsumi: D-Did he say he was interested…? He’s a guy… and I’m a guy… But… he’s interested in me…? Huh? What the hell are you pricks looking at!?

[He runs to them but our heroes manages to escape.]

Chie Satonaka: That scared the hell out of me. He’s even worse in person than on TV…

Yukiko Amagi: The one on TV last night was definitely Kanji-kun…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah… And I just realized something. Remember the common points we were talking about? His mom fits the pattern. She’s a woman, and she knew Ms. Yamano. But it was her son who appeared on TV… So what does that mean?

”His mother’s a target.”✔
”Kanji’s a target.”
”They’re both targets.”
”I don’t know.”

Yosuke Hanamura: If we’re still assuming the victims are all female, that fits. But that doesn’t explain why Kanji appeared…

Yukiko Amagi: Oh… Maybe it’s similar to my case. If you think about it, my mother fit the victim profile more than I did. She was the one who dealt directly with Ms. Yamano… but I was the one who was targeted.

Chie Satonaka: Does that mean it’ll be the kid again, instead of the mother? But if that’s true, then the killer’s motive makes no sense at all. It’d have nothing to do with silencing witnesses or revenge or anything.

Yosuke Hanamura: Y’think we’re on the wrong track…? Maybe even the first case had nothing to do with grudges or revenge… Or is there some kinda secret in the textile shop itself…? Argh! I’m totally lost!

Yukiko Amagi: But we can’t ignore this.

Chie Satonaka: Hmmm… Why don’t we just go ahead and ask Kanji himself? We could at least see if anything odd’s happened lately. He scares the wits out of me, but…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, wasn’t Kanji making plans with that weird kid a moment ago? Something about meeting up at school. I heard he’s been skipping school ever since the new year started… Doesn’t that seem a little suspicious?

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, something did seem weird. It’s suspicious, all right. There’s something funny going on here… I can sense it.

Yosuke Hanamura: ”Sense”? You sound like Teddie… Still, we might find some clues. Alright… Let’s try staking out both Kanji and his family’s store. We definitely don’t want the killer getting ahead of us. That being said… Yukiko, can I have your cell number?

Chie Satonaka: Hey… Was this your plan all along?

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh, no? I got everybody’s phone number except for hers. And the Y section of my address book needs some filling out.

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* While we’re on the subject, could you stop calling me at night just to tell dirty jokes? You really sound like a pervert.

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hey! I’m trying to have a conversation with Yukiko here!

Yukiko Amagi: …… Oh, that reminds me… I need to buy tofu on my way home.

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa… She didn’t hear a word I said…

Chie Satonaka: Okay then, the stakeout is set for tomorrow. Hmm… Stakeouts… Tailing people… Whoo, I’m getting goosebumps!

> You decided to stake out Kanji and the textile shop tomorrow.

CHAPTER 16: I’m Taking You Punks DOWN!
May 17th, 2011. Thursday. Near the school.
Chie Satonaka: Has the target arrived at school!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yes, Ma’am! Visual ID confirmed! Target arrived in-zone near the end of his mess break, with mother-issued rations in hand. Current status: In the bathroom, fixing his hair. The target was acting nervous. I left my position before he had a chance to pick on me!

Yukiko Amagi: I wonder what kind of plans they made… It didn’t seem like he knew that boy very well.

Chie Satonaka: Well, I think there’s something more subtle-- Oh, he’s here!

Slender young man: I didn’t keep you waiting, I hope?

Kanji Tatsumi: No, I-I just got here too…

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What in the world was that…?

Chie Satonaka: Anyways! We gotta hurry after them, or we’ll lose them!

Yosuke Hanamura: Okay… Then let’s split up into two groups. One team will follow Kanji, and the other will stake out the shop.

Chie Satonaka: R-Roger that! How should we split the teams?

Pair with Yosuke✔
Pair with Chie
Pair with Yukiko

Chie Satonaka: I don’t know… What if something happens and we’re the only ones there? Oh man, they’re almost out of sight! C’mon, Yosuke!

Yosuke Hanamura: So, I’m pairing up with Chie…? Eh, okay. Alright! We’ll need to pretend we’re on a date to make it look natural!

Chie Satonaka: Not in a million years! There’ll be no need for that if we stay out of sight. Sheesh… Let’s hurry up and go!

Yukiko Amagi: I wonder if those two will be alright… Oh… U-Um, that leaves us in charge of staking out the textile shop. So… shall we?

[They go to the Shopping District. Yukiko buys some drinks.]

Yukiko Amagi: Sorry about the wait… This one’s for you. Everything seems fine at the shop. I hope it stays that way… Do you think the culprit will come…?

”I’m sure of it.”
”I doubt it.”✔
”No worries, I’ll protect you.”

Yukiko Amagi: Our efforts might be fruitless… But maybe that’s for the best. It would be scary if the culprit did show up… But if they do, I’ll do what I can to help you catch them. You all saved my life… I don’t want to be the only one doing nothing. I mean… I’m sure there’s something I can do… Oh, sorry. I went on and on without realizing… I-I guess I’m a little nervous. I’ve never chatted with a boy my age like this before… Chie, of course, has no problem getting along with guys because of her personality… But I think she’s had more fun hanging out with you and Yosuke lately… The same is true for me.

> You sense Yukiko’s gratitude and affection…

> You feel a faint bond forming between you and Yukiko…

> You haven’t yet asked Yukiko for her contact information. 

Ask her straight out
Say it’s for the investigation✔

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, you’re right. We’ll need to contact each other if anything happens.

> You exchanged cell numbers with Yukiko.

> There seems to be no change over at the shop.

> You spoke with Yukiko about many different things…

[Meanwhile Chie and Yosuke…]

Chie Satonaka: Man, this is weird…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah… We definitely stand out.

Chie Satonaka: No, I mean THEM! I get this weird feeling about them…

Yosuke Hanamura: Weird? What about them’s weird?

Chie Satonaka: Umm… I don’t know how to put it… Maybe it’s just my imagination… Hey, how do you think the others are doing?

Yosuke Hanamura: Beats me. For all we know, he’s hitting on Yukiko as we speak.

Chie Satonaka: Yeaaaah, no. He’s not like you. Yukiko doesn’t seem to be interested in that stuff anyway. Wait… are you saying he’s interested in her?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh!? Uh… I… wouldn’t know… We don’t really talk about that kinda stuff… Hahahaha.

Chie Satonaka: Now I’m even more suspicious! You know something, don’t you?

Yosuke Hanamura: I-I seriously don’t know! It’s not like we’ve been hanging out that long, haha…

Kanji Tatsumi: …The hell are you two doing?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, well, you see… We’re… We’re just two crazy lovebirds!

Chie Satonaka: Whaddya mean bird!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Play along, birdbrain!

Kanji Tatsumi: Didn’t I see you guys yesterday…?

Yosuke Hanamura: A-Ahahahaha…! C-C’mon, it just so happened that we were walking behind you guys. Pure coincidence! Hey! Our houses are just over that way, so we’ll be going now…

Chie Satonaka: Um, look, we weren’t planning on getting in you guys’ way, and there’s nothing strange about it, either…

Kanji Tatsumi: S-Strange…!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Why can’t you keep your big mouth shut!?

Kanji Tatsumi: W-Wait, dammit! This ain’t what you think! Y-You got it all wrong! Hey! Are you listening, dammit!? It seriously ain’t like that!

[They returns to You and Yukiko.]

Chie Satonaka: We regret to inform… that our mission failed.

Yosuke Hanamura: There was nowhere to hide.

Yukiko Amagi: Well… let’s wait here a little longer. Maybe Kanji-kun will come home.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah…

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh…? What’re you guys doing here? You’re those stupid lovebirds I just saw!

Chie Satonaka: We are not a couple!

Kanji Tatsumi: Why are you assholes followin’ me around!? Dammit, what the hell’s going on!? *sigh* I ain’t sayin’ this is you guys’ fault… But… Dammit! *sigh*

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, uh… mind if we ask something? Has anything strange happened to you lately?

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? Strange…? What’s this ”strange” stuff, huh!? Are you saying that I’m strange!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? N-No, I didn’t mean--!

Kanji Tatsumi: You shitheads better get the hell out of my face, or I’m taking you down!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wha--!? Wait, why!?

Kanji Tatsumi: I look like I’m joking!?

> You ran away from Kanji as fast as your legs would carry you…

[The heroes runs away in fear. Yosuke even get punched in the head apparently.]

Chie Satonaka: Urgh… Too much running…

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, nothing happened today, so I guess everything’s okay… But it’s already been a few days since he appeared on the Midnight Channel. If this is anything like Yukiko’s case, it’ll happen soon.

Yukiko Amagi: Then we can’t let our guard down… I think we should come back tomorrow to check up on him.

Chie Satonaka: Looks like we got no choice… Let’s go home. I’m wiped…

[Evening. Dojima’s place.]

> Your phone is ringing.

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, hello? It’s Yukiko. I-I’m sorry to call so late. Um, Kanji-kun seems to be missing! I had some calls to make for the inn, so I called the textile shop as well. When I spoke to Kanji-kun’s mother… She told me that he left the house and hasn’t returned since. She did say that this happens all the time, but… what do you think?

”He should be fine.”
”This sounds bad.”
”About what?”✔

Yukiko Amagi: ”About what”…? The case, of course! It’s going to rain again tonight. Maybe the Midnight Channel will come on. Then we’ll know for sure if something happened to Kanji-kun or not. I’ll make sure to check out the TV at midnight… Talk to you later.

> Yukiko hung up.

> You need to watch the Midnight Channel…

> It’s still raining…

> Something may appear on TV…

> …You see something on the screen.

> The image is clear and sharp.

Kanji Tatsumi: Hel-LO, dear viewers… It’s time for ”Bad, Bad Bathhouse”! Tonight, I’ll introduce a superb site for those searching for sublime love that surpasses the separation of the sexes! I’m your host, Kanji Tatsumi, serving you this scandalously special sneak-in report! Goodness gracious, just imagine the things that might happen to me there! Ooooh! Well then, let’s get this show on the road! Tootaloo!

> That was unmistakably Kanji…

Yosuke Hanamura: H-H-Hey! What the--I mean--!?

> Yosuke’s too flustered to get his point across.

”Calm down.”
”It really was Kanji.”✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? O-Oh yeah, you’re right! What in the world was that…? But… Dammit, it’s just what we were afraid of… If only we’d held our ground and stayed there a little longer… *sigh* In any case, that place that was behind him… What do you think it is? A ”superb site for those searching for sublime love”? I just don’t get it! Anyways… We’d better hurry and come up with a plan tomorrow!

> …You decided to go to bed.

May 18th, 2011. Wednesday. School.
Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* Given the pattern so far, Kanji’s already inside the TV…

Yukiko Amagi: I wonder what the Midnight Channel really is…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hmm…

Chie Satonaka: At first, I thought it was one of those ”paranormal” things, but when I gave it a try… it was real. Turns out it’s actually connected to another world…

Yosuke Hanamura: If there’s a rumor going around, that means a bunch of people are watching it.

Yukiko Amagi: How did the rumor go…? If you stare into a turned-off TV on a rainy night…

Yosuke Hanamura: No one in their right mind would try something that ridiculous, don’tcha think? Unless someone urged them to. But if you actually try, it does work. And not just once. If this rumor spreads and everyone starts watching the Midnight Channel…

Chie Satonaka: It could cause a huge panic…

Yosuke Hanamura: If Teddie is right, the missing people themselves create the stuff we see. So it’s not random. It’s specifically related to whoever goes missing.

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* Yukiko had a show too, but she doesn’t remember doing anything like that.

Yukiko Amagi: Um, this might be a little off subject, but… The culprit is probably watching the shows that come on… right?

Chie Satonaka: No doubt. He’s probably sitting back and enjoying-- Wait a sec… I bet he IS enjoying it! He’s probably laughing his head off watching the ”show” that comes on after he throws people into the TV!

Yosuke Hanamura: Ahhh, I get it. Yeah, it’s definitely possible. Ugh… Now when I think of the killer, I get this image of a total sicko! ”I wanna see everything about you, Yuki-chan!”

Chie Satonaka: Urgh, ugh, ugh! Wait, so if people saw Yukiko’s show, do you think people were watching what happened to me too!? Oh, that is IT! That killer is dead meat! I’m gonna leave footprints all over his face! Guys! First, we save Kanji! Then, we crush the killer! Finally, we crush the killer and send him to hell!! Got it!?

> You’ve all strengthened your resolve to save Kanji…

Yukiko Amagi: Heehee… Ch-Chie, those last two were the same thing…

Chie Satonaka: Uh… I know…

[They enter the TV world.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey Teddie, someone’s here, right?

Teddie: Oh… Yep. I think someone’s here.

Chie Satonaka: You think…? Do you know where he is?

Teddie: I dunno.

Yukiko Amagi: We think it’s a boy named Kanji…

Teddie: I dunno…

Chie Satonaka: What’s wrong? Not feeling well?

Teddie: Well, I sniff and I sniff. But I still can’t tell where the smell comes from.

Yosuke Hanamura: Aren’t you thinking too much about too many things? I mean last time, you were wondering about who you really are and how long you’ve been here. Your head’s empty to begin with, dude. Don’t stress out over stuff too much.

Teddie: You’re right…

Chie Satonaka: Whoa… He’s seriously down about this…

Yosuke Hanamura: If you can’t figure out where Kanji is, we’re in deep trouble. We can’t just wander around aimlessly in a place like this…

Teddie: I know what might help! You should give me a clue about this Kanji person! It’s just a feeling I have. I think I could concentrate better with it. Do you have anything that could give me a good understanding of him?

Yosuke Hanamura: Something about Kanji, huh…? I can’t really think of anything besides all the rumors about him.

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, it’s not like we know him that well.

Teddie: I just need some sort of hint… Something that tells me what he’s really like.

Yukiko Amagi: Why don’t we ask around and find people who know Kanji-kun personally?

> Teddie may be able to grasp Kanji’s location if he gets more information about Kanji.

> But what kind of information does he need…?

> You decide to ask around town about Kanji…

CHAPTER 17: The Steamy Bathhouse
[The heroes find a way to enter Kanji’s Baths in TV world.]

> It’s awfully muggy…

Chie Satonaka: Is it just me… or does the fog here seem kinda different?

Yukiko Amagi: My glasses are fogging up.

Yosuke Hanamura: Man, it’s hot in here. This place is like a--

Manly voice: C’mere, pussycat…

Handsome voice: Oh… Such well-defined pecs…

Manly voice: There’s no need to be scared…

Chie Satonaka: Uhhhh…

Manly voice: Now, just relax…

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Wait a sec! I-I don’t wanna go!

Yukiko Amagi: Is Kanji-kun really here, Teddie?

Teddie: The nose knows!

Yosuke Hanamura: We’re… really going in here…? Urgh, I can already feel the sweat rolling down my back…

Chie Satonaka: That’s because it’s so hot…

> Kanji’s location has been pinpointed. All that’s left is to rescue him.

> You should prepare yourself for the rescue mission…

[The heroes enter the Baths and find Kanji…]

Chie Satonaka: There he is!

Yosuke Hanamura: Kanji!

Kanji Tatsumi: Oooooh, my my! Thank you for your undivided attention! At last, I’ve penetrated the facility! These images are coming to you live from inside this steamy paradise! But I’ve yet to have any charming encounters. Could this hot fog be the cause? It’s like steam rising from sweat! Mmmm, my body’s tingling with excitement!

Yosuke Hanamura: Crap… This is so wrong in so many ways…

Chie Satonaka: I remember it being kinda like this on Yukiko’s show, too…

Yukiko Amagi: N-No… It wasn’t like this…

Chie Satonaka: Those voices again… Wait, are they louder this time?

Yosuke Hanamura: These voices… I was wondering whose they could be, since it’s only the victim in here… Is it the people watching outside?

Chie Satonaka: You mean, everybody who’s watching the Midnight Channel? They’re reacting to the ”show”? Yikes… If people are watching Kanji-kun now, he’s gonna be a legend in a way he never intended…

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, it’s really his Shadow, not him. But normal people won’t know that…

Teddie: The Shadows are getting really restless!

Kanji Tatsumi: That elusive thing I truly yearn for… Will I finally find it here? Teehee! Well then, onward and deeper to reach further realms of romance! Let’s get going, dammit! (runs away)

Yukiko Amagi: Kanji-kun!

Teddie: That was his other self… It’s trying to reveal his hidden feelings. It seems much worse than that time with Yuki-chan’s Shadow… At this rate, it might end up getting ”bear” naked.

Yukiko Amagi: ”Bear”… naked…?

Chie Satonaka: Oh man… here it comes…

Yukiko Amagi: Uh… Was I supposed to laugh?

[They run after Kanji. Teddie falls on the floor ni indignation.]

CHAPTER 18: A Man’s World
Chie Satonaka: There they are!

Yosuke Hanamura: Kanji!

Kanji Tatsumi: I-I…

Shadow Kanji: Oh, come now, enough with the charade. Isn’t it awful to deceive people? To deceive yourself…? What’s so bad about doing what I want to do?

Kanji Tatsumi: That has nothin’ to do with it…

Shadow Kanji: I’m what you really want, aren’t I?

Kanji Tatsumi: Hell no!

Shadow Kanji: Ohh, how I hate girls… So arrogant and self-centered! They cry if you get angry, they gossip behind your back, they spread nasty lies… They look at me like some… some disgusting THING and say that I’m a weirdo… Laughing at me, all the while! ”You like to sew? What a queer!” ”Painting is so not you.” ”But you’re a guy…” ”You don’t act like a guy…” ”Why aren’t you manly…?” What does it mean to be ”a guy”? What does it mean to be ”manly”? Girls are so scary…

Kanji Tatsumi: I-I ain’t scared of ’em!

Shadow Kanji: Men are much better… They’d never say those awful, degrading things. Yes, I vastly prefer men…

Kanji Tatsumi: Hell with that! What makes you think you can say that shit with my face…!?

Shadow Kanji: Why, you’re me… and I’m you… You do know that, don’t you…?

Kanji Tatsumi: No… Nuh-uh! No way! There’s no way in hell that you’re me!

Shadow Kanji: *chuckle* Teeheehee… You’re me, and there’s no denying it!

[He transforms into three muscular bosses.]

Yukiko Amagi: Kanji-kun!

Teddie: Everyone, on guard!

CHAPTER 19: Shadow Kanji
[The fight begins]

Shadow Kanji: I am a shadow… The true self… I’m just being true to myself… And that’s why… I’ll get rid of anything in my way!

Yukiko Amagi: Are these… Kanji-kun’s true feelings?

Yosuke Hanamura: This isn’t really him! It’s just his going haywire!

Shadow Kanji: This has nothing to do with you guys anymore! Didn’t I just say I’m gonna get rid of you!?

[The heroes defeat Shadow Kanji.]

Kanji Tatsumi: Dammit…

Yukiko Amagi: Kanji-kun!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wait, Yukiko! Something’s wrong.

Teddie: I-It’s still coming at us! Kanji is still rejecting it…

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, I can’t blame him with this many witnesses…

Shadow Kanji: Such a passionate approach…

Yosuke Hanamura: What?

Shadow Kanji: I think that you three… would make wonderful boyfriends.

Yosuke Hanamura: S-Stop it! Y-You got it all wrong!

Kanji Tatsumi: Enough… Stop… What the hell are you blabbering about…?

Shadow Kanji: I don’t care who… Won’t someone, anyone, please accept me…?

Kanji Tatsumi: Stop… it…

Shadow Kanji: Accept me for who I am!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-Whoa! I really don’t swing that way!

Kanji Tatsumi: I said stop it! (he punches shadow self) Tch. Can’t believe something like this is inside me…

Yosuke Hanamura: Kanji, you’re…

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah, I know… I’ve known all this time I had something like you! It ain’t a matter of guys or chicks… I’m just scared shitless of being rejected. I’m a total pansy who tries to make everyone hate me.

”That’s a part of you too.”
”You need to be brave.”
”You’re not alone.”✔

Kanji Tatsumi: ……C’mon… get up. Anyone who looks like me, I know they ain’t so weak that they can’t take a punch. I already know that you’re me… You’re me… and I’m you, dammit!

> The strength of heart required to face oneself has been made manifest…

> Kanji has faced his other self…

> He has obtained the facade used to overcome life’s hardships, the Persona Take-Mikazuchi!

Kanji Tatsumi: Ngh… Shit…

[He fall on the floor.]

Chie Satonaka: Kanji-kun!

Yosuke Hanamura: Let’s get him out of here!

[They take his out of the TV world.]

Yukiko Amagi: Kanji-kun… Are you okay?

Kanji Tatsumi: It’s… It’s nothin’… Whoa… Ngh… Heheh… I feel great… It’s like my mind’s all cleared up…

Yosuke Hanamura: No need to show off, dude. Here.

Kanji Tatsumi: Hey… About what just happened…

”It’s a dream.”
”Forget about it.”
”We’ll tell you later.”✔

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah… You better…

Yukiko Amagi: We’ll explain everything later. You need to take a rest now.

Chie Satonaka: We’ll be waiting for you at school.

Kanji Tatsumi: School…? Sure, if I ever feel like going.

Yosuke Hanamura: I’ll take this guy home. If anyone asks, I’ll just say I found him somewhere like this.

> You were able to rescue Kanji.

> Now you must wait for him to recover.

> Will this take you one step closer to solving the case…?

[Evening at Dojima’s.]

> The three of you are sitting down having dinner.

Ryotaro Dojima: Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember that Kanji Tatsumi guy I told you about? You know, the one who went nuts on that news special. His family’s shop called in to report him missing, but now he’s been found. I thought I’d let you know, since you go to the same high school.

”I’m glad to hear that.”✔
”I didn’t know about that.”
”Sure, whatever.”

Ryotaro Dojima: Yeah. Well, I doubt there would’ve been too much fuss about a guy like him disappearing. …Huh. I suppose you two are in different years… One other thing… Some people have seen you around that textile shop lately, I hear. It’s not the kind of shop students normally visit. Just what kind of business did you have there…?

”Nothing much.”
”My friend took me there.”✔
”I was out shopping…”

Ryotaro Dojima: A friend…? Oh… That Amagi girl? That’s right, her family’s inn buys their stuff wholesale… *sigh* …Fine. Just don’t get yourself in over your head, okay?

Nanako Dojima: …Are you fighting again?

CHAPTER 20: Yukiko Can’t Cook!
May 22nd, 2011. Sunday.
Nanako Dojima: Good morning.

> Nanako seems troubled…

Nanako Dojima: Um, we’re growing veggies at school. The teacher gave us ”seedlings,” and told us to try growing them at home. I asked Dad and he said I could plant them wherever I want. I don’t know where’s good, though…

> It seems Nanako wants to grow vegetables.

> You recall that there is an open plot of land on the side of the house. You may be able to set up a simple garden there.

> Is that part of the Dojima property…?

Nanako Dojima: The place next to the house? Mmm-hmm. We don’t use it, but it’s our yard. Is that where we’re gonna plant the seedlings? The teacher gave us seeds, and told us to try growing them at home. Mmm-hmm. We don’t use it, but it’s our yard. Is that where we’re gonna plant the seeds? Is this where we’re gonna plant the seedlings?

> Was someone once planning to fix up this yard? There are tools around here you think you can use…

> You should be able to make a nice garden with these…

> ……

> You used the tools here to make a garden!

Nanako Dojima: Wow! Can we plant the seedlings now?

> You planted the tomato seedlings together with Nanako…

Nanako Dojima: Do you think the veggies will grow?

”I’m sure they will.”
”They will if we work hard.”✔

Nanako Dojima: Mmm-hmm. I’ll do my best to take care of them! Hey, I want to make a sign! No one will know what we planted until the veggies grow. I gotta write down that there are veggies growing here.

”All right, let’s make one.”✔
”What kind of sign do you want?”
”Sounds hard.”

Nanako Dojima: Yay! Thanks!

> You put up the sign you made with Nanako next to the garden…

> The sign is small, but it makes for a perfect finishing touch!

Nanako Dojima: We did it! I’ll be in charge of watering the plants!

”I’ll help too.”✔
”It’s all up to you.”

Nanako Dojima: Okay! We planted them together, so we should grow them together too!

> Nanako seems happy…

Nanako Dojima: Um, umm…

> Nanako seems to be at a loss…

Nanako Dojima: Um, will you teach me what to do if I get stuck?

> You decide to grow the vegetables together with Nanako after all…

Nanako Dojima: If a lot of veggies grow, will our house be like Junes? *giggle* I can’t wait!

> There are seedlings planted in the garden. You should check on them frequently until it’s time to harvest them…

May 23rd, 2011. Monday.
Mr. Morooka: Should we halt class and take a nap? …Shape up, assholes! Where’s your dignity!? The first-years are slacking off because you guys are slacking off! Kanji Tatsumi is a perfect example! That lazy punk is always ditching! I’d expel his ass from school if I were his homeroom teacher! You may not think it’s any of your business, but it is! You could all be expelled just as easily! Cause any problems, and you earn a one-way ticket out of this place! You’d best keep that in mind!

CHAPTER 21: Dojima Opens Up
Ms. Sofue: Please turn to page 150 and refer to the map of Ancient Egypt. You’ll also find a picture of the Great Pyramids, the pride of Egypt. It was said that these pyramids were built by slaves. However, upon excavation, attendance records of the workers were found, disproving that theory. Hohoho, I’d believed in the nobility of the ancient Egyptians since even before they found those records… Ancient remains are the real stars of history! Don’t you all feel the romance that comes of looking back on ancient times? My older brother is just a boring old samurai with no interest in ancient civilizations. He looks like an idiot in that kabuto! This nemes is much more elegant! Hmm? You there! Mr. Hanamura! Don’t start zoning out just because I changed the subject! Tell me how the theory that the pyramids were built by slaves was disproven!

Yosuke Hanamura: What!? Uh… Something about laborers?

”Resumes.”
”Contracts.”
”Attendance logs.”✔
”Employee ID cards.”

> You gave him the answer you think is correct. 

Ms. Sofue: Impressive, Mr. Hanamura. You’ve got it. Yes, the theory was disproven after the attendance logs of the laborers were found. There are even notes listed as reasons for absence, such as ”hangover”! If the labor was being done by slaves, they wouldn’t have been allowed to take days off for things like that, would they? It seems that the long-prevailing theory was very different from the truth.

Yosuke Hanamura: Thanks, Yu! I’ll have to listen to the lectures more attentively…

> Yosuke appreciates you!

> You feel you’ve become a little closer to Yosuke… 

CHAPTER 22: Pickled Radish
Weather announcer: And now the weather. The week ended on a wet note as rain clouds moved into the area. As a result, a thick fog is expected to form in the Inaba region later tonight…

> It seems the fog will set in tonight…

> It’s midnight…

> The fog has set in…

> No one is appearing on the Midnight Channel.

> Since Kanji has been rescued, it seems the killer was thwarted this time…

> It’s getting late…

[The next day. School roof.]

Kanji Tatsumi: H-Hi there!

Chie Satonaka: Snrk! Ha, where’d the manners come from?

Kanji Tatsumi: Well, um… I didn’t know you guys were my senpai. Uhh… Thanks a bunch. Though I don’t really remember what happened…

Yukiko Amagi: There are some things we’d like you to tell us about.

Chie Satonaka: First off, who was that boy you met with?

Kanji Tatsumi: I-I really don’t know much about him… I mean, I’ve only met him twice…

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, but you walked home from school with him. What did you guys talk about?

Kanji Tatsumi: Uh, well… He just asked stuff like… If anything different happened lately… I dunno where my head was at… When I came to my senses, I blurted out that I wanted to see him again.

Chie Satonaka: To a guy.

Kanji Tatsumi: I, uh… I don’t really get it myself. Girls are so loud and obnoxious, so, y’know… I really don’t like dealing with ’em. Guys are a lot more laid-back. S-So, uh, I started thinking… What if I’m the type who never gets interested in girls…? And I couldn’t accept that, so I kept spinning around and around in my head…

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, I can understand the part about feeling more relaxed around dudes.

”How’re you feeling?”✔
”Have you calmed down?”
”Do you not like girls…?”

Kanji Tatsumi: I’m fine now. I mean, it was all in my head, when y’get down to it. I was the one shutting out that stuff. So, uhh… Our family’s run a textile shop for generations… Oh yeah, you already knew that. My parents are kinda weird… They say stuff like, ”Dyes are one with the universe,” and ”Cloth is alive…” That’s the kinda house I grew up in. So I’ve been interested in sewing and stuff since I was a kid. But the second I say stuff like that, people look at me funny… Girls make fun of me, the people in the neighborhood treat me like I’m some zoo animal, so I was sick of everything. And when I got to my senses… I was running wild. Shit, what’s with me today? I’m going on and on about myself… Forget all that. Man, I must look really lame right now.

”Yeah.”
”Don’t act like a big shot.”
”You’re really pretty cool.”

Kanji Tatsumi: Nah, I doubt it… Haha… I’ve never talked about any of this stuff before. Guess I never had anyone to tell it to. I guess I wasn’t really afraid of girls. I was just scared of people in general. But all that’s behind me.

Chie Satonaka: Wow, I’m surprised… You’re a good kid…

Kanji Tatsumi: D-Don’t call me a good kid…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hahaha, no need to get embarrassed. You’re a big guy, you can take it. Hey, is there anything you remember after you ran into us the second time? You know, after you chased us away and said you were gonna take us down.

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? Uhh… I went home… I was gonna sleep it off in my room… Wait, I think someone came…

Yosuke Hanamura: To your house!? Who was it!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Uh, well, it was just a feeling I had… I dunno if anyone actually came… Other than that… I remember some weird, dark entrance thing… When I woke up, I was laid out on the floor of that sauna place.

Yukiko Amagi: A dark entrance… Could it have been a TV?

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh…? Now that you mention it, maybe so… Uh, why do you ask?

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, no reason… I was just wondering.

Yosuke Hanamura: Did the police ask you anything?

Kanji Tatsumi: Well, my mom had called the cops to look for me, so they questioned me for a while. I told them exactly what I just told you and they looked at me like I was crazy. So, like… Are you guys playing detective or somethin’?

Chie Satonaka: Mmm, well, something like that.

Kanji Tatsumi: Anything I can do to help? If there’s some bastard out there who put me through this, I ain’t gonna rest until I make ’em pay.

Yosuke Hanamura: Seriously? Awesome! You’d make a great addition to our team! Whaddaya say, Leader?

”Of course he can.”
”Forget it.”
”This won’t be easy.”✔

Kanji Tatsumi: Heh, don’t worry, I ain’t taking this lightly. You guys saved my life… I’ve made up my mind to risk my life for you. I’ll do my best!

> Kanji Tatsumi joined your group!

> He’ll definitely be a strong asset in solving the case.

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, if we’re gonna welcome aboard a new member…

Yukiko Amagi: Should we take him to our special headquarters?

Chie Satonaka: We’re still calling it that…?

Kanji Tatsumi: Wh-What’s that!?

Yosuke Hanamura: C’mon, let’s go!

[They go to their secret headquarters… to Junes food court, yeah.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Man, you eat a lot… Were you listening to what we were saying?

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? Shurr, I waf lifnin’.

Yosuke Hanamura: Close your mouth!

Kanji Tatsumi: So, uh… Wait, so someone’s killing people with a TV…? What, is he beating them to death?

Yosuke Hanamura: No, they weren’t being beaten with a TV! Were you listening at all…?

Chie Satonaka: Don’t worry, he’ll understand once he sees the place with his own eyes. But the way it happened was just the same as with Yukiko. The killer kidnapped him first, then threw him into the TV.

Yukiko Amagi: Yeah… It’s scary.

TV-loving student: That show’s been pretty crazy lately, huh?

Student’s friend: Yeah. I keep wondering who’ll show up next.

TV-loving student: I knew before it came on that he’d be the next one to appear. What’s that dude’s name? That first-year who used to be in a biker gang…

Kanji Tatsumi: Who the hell d’you think was next? His name is Kanji Tatsumi… And he wasn’t in a biker gang--he’s the one who beat the shit out of those leathered-up pansies. So who are you dipshits…!? (they run away) Feh… Boring.

Chie Satonaka: I can’t stand it… Sure, they have no idea it’s related to the murders, but still… How can they talk about their schoolmate like that?

Yosuke Hanamura: They’re like onlookers at a car crash. As long as it’s not happening to them, they’re dying to see… Damn, this sucks… We don’t even know who’s gonna be targeted anymore.

Yukiko Amagi: This case disproved our assumption that all the victims are female…

Chie Satonaka: What was the other thing we thought they had in common?

Yukiko Amagi: People involved in the initial case, about Ms. Yamano, are the targets… How about that?

”I think it’s correct.”✔
”I don’t think it holds up.”
”We still don’t know.”

Chie Satonaka: Well, both Yukiko and Kanji-kun were involved in some way or another.

Yosuke Hanamura: But that announcer was dealing with their mothers, not them.

Chie Satonaka: Hmm. Think we’re wrong about this one too?

Yosuke Hanamura: I dunno… That announcer was involved with their mothers, not them. We haven’t come up with a reason yet why the killer would target their children. I guess it’s too early to say if we’re wrong about that one. But that announcer was involved with their mothers, not them…

Kanji Tatsumi: You guys sayin’ you don’t have any clues?

Kanji Tatsumi: Well listen up, ’cause I got somethin’ big.

Yosuke Hanamura: What’s that?

Kanji Tatsumi: Okay, when I made my comeback at school today, there was an annoying brat hanging around. Turns out he was snooping around about Senpai’s and my disappearance, so I took this from him. I dunno what the hell this all is, though.

Chie Satonaka: Uh, and you took it anyway?

> You took the paper from Kanji.

> There are several lists…

> Which one will you read out loud?

Enka album chart
Female announcer ranking
List of TV programs

> It’s the enka album chart for May. Misuzu Hiiragi’s new album is #1…

Chie Satonaka: I hear her album sales have gone up since the incident. If she knows about it and she’s using it to sell her songs, that’s pretty sketchy.

Yosuke Hanamura: She has an alibi, though. I don’t think this involves her… Let’s move on.

> It’s a ranking of female announcer popularity for various local stations in March.

> Mayumi Yamano is around the lower middle of the list…

Chie Satonaka: Does this mean she wasn’t that well- known until the incident?

Yosuke Hanamura: It’s just this guy’s personal rankings, nothing important. What does the next one say?

> Mayumi Yamano 4/11, Saki Konishi 4/13…

Yosuke Hanamura: What’re these dates? April 11th…?

Chie Satonaka: Oh, they found the first body on the day school started, so that would have been… the 12th. The 11th is the day before that…

Yosuke Hanamura: I know I can’t forget the day Saki-senpai’s body was found… That was the 15th. So then, what are these dates? And what does ”List of TV programs” mean? What’s ”Saki Konishi, April 13th”…?

”The day I met her.”
”The day she was on TV.”✔
”Her birthday.”

Yosuke Hanamura: I see… Yeah, there’s no doubt about it.

Chie Satonaka: Oh yeah… I saw that, too. They were interviewing her ’cause she found the first body.

Yukiko Amagi: Then this part… ”Mayumi Yamano, April 11th.” Is that the day she appeared on TV, too…?

Chie Satonaka: Oh, she was on! I remember now! That was when the affair hit the news!

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, wait a sec… Yukiko, didn’t you get interviewed too? When did that interview air!? I-I think it was when I was absent from school… Um… It was the day after I met you at the embankment. I had my kimono on… Do you remember?

”I remember.”✔
”Not really…”

Yukiko Amagi: I went shopping that day, so… April 15th! And right after that, I was kidnapped.

Yosuke Hanamura: Kanji! What about the television special you were on!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Oh yeah, that thing… Damn show made my mom go apeshit on me and…

Yosuke Hanamura: The date! Just tell us the date!

Kanji Tatsumi: Uhhh, I don’t remember the exact date… But it wasn’t too long before I met you guys.

Yosuke Hanamura: It’s true, then… Everyone was on TV before they disappeared.

Chie Satonaka: So, you think the killer’s targeting people he sees on TV…?

Yukiko Amagi: I was so caught up with the news reports about the incidents that I didn’t notice at all…

”It can’t be a coincidence.”✔
”There’s no doubt about it.”
”……”

Yosuke Hanamura: Now that I think about it… When the killer failed with Yukiko, they moved to Kanji instead of trying again… Maybe this ”being on TV” thing is some stupid rule that the killer’s following.

Chie Satonaka: That’s right… The killer could’ve targeted the same victim again…

Yosuke Hanamura: I think there’s a definite connection here between the kidnappings and the TV broadcasts. The victims weren’t just involved with the first case. They were also shown on the mass media.

Chie Satonaka: That must be it…

Yosuke Hanamura: But if so… What’s the motive? Why kill someone just because they were on TV? Argh… Dammit, now that I think about it, we haven’t gotten anywhere! Why can’t I be smarter…!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Dude, why beat yourself up? I think you guys are awesome. I mean, you guys noticed what was happening to me and even risked your lives to stop it. That’s more than enough.

Yukiko Amagi: You rescued me, too. We may not have solved the mystery, but we’ve saved two people already.

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s true, but…

Yukiko Amagi: What’s more, everyone’s deduction that Kanji-kun might be next was right on the nose.

Chie Satonaka: I know! We were so close.

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? You knew before it happened? Damn, I wish you guys’d come a little earlier, then…

Chie Satonaka: Well, if we know this much, I think we can outsmart the killer next time. Then it’s a countdown to their arrest.

Yukiko Amagi: Don’t forget, it’s always possible that Kanji-kun was the last target.

Yosuke Hanamura: Or so we hope… We’ve thwarted them twice already. Here’s hoping the killer’s learned their lesson by now. Anyways, let’s keep checking the Midnight Channel like usual when it rains.

Chie Satonaka: That reminds me… The school campout’s next week. I hope it doesn’t rain. It’s for both the first-year and second-year students, so we’ll see you there, Kanji-kun.

Kanji Tatsumi: Seriously? School, huh…? What a drag… Yo, mind if I order another grilled steak? I’m gonna finish this one up while the next one’s on the grill. We’re… going Dutch on the meal, right?

Chie Satonaka: Well, let’s get going. I think our new teammate needs to meet Mr. Bear.

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? What’s up? Fine, whatever… I’ll go for something cheap, like ramen. Wait, or should I get a takoyaki set…? Man, I can’t decide.

Yukiko Amagi: None of it.

Kanji Tatsumi: Whaaat!?

[They enter the TV world.]

Kanji Tatsumi: Oh yeah… Now that you mention it, I kinda remember this thing… Didn’t think it was a bear, though. Hey, why IS it a bear?

Yosuke Hanamura: Dunno.

Teddie: Me neither. I’ve been wondering too.

Kanji Tatsumi: I-It’s kinda cute… M-Mind if I pet you?

Teddie: No touching allowed, Mister.

Kanji Tatsumi: Wha--!? Hey, don’t give me any lip, bear! Tch… Uhh… By the way, I been wondering. You were kidnapped too, right, Yukiko-senpai?

Yukiko Amagi: Huh…? Yeah, it wasn’t long before you.

Kanji Tatsumi: So like, that means you came out to everyone too?

Yukiko Amagi: Th-That’s… Um…

Kanji Tatsumi: What was it like for Senpai-- (she slaps him) Urgh!

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, sorry… I didn’t mean to hit you so hard…

Kanji Tatsumi: M-My jaw…

Yukiko Amagi: I’ll be more gentle next time…

Kanji Tatsumi: More… gentle…?

Chie Satonaka: What a pair of dimwits…

Teddie: Oh yeah! Here’s a present from me, Kanji! It’s to celebrate you joining the team!

Kanji Tatsumi: Ah, so these are the glasses you guys told me about.

Yukiko Amagi: Hurry and put them on.

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? S-Sure… But hang on, aren’t these different from everyone else’s?

Yukiko Amagi: I-It looks perfect on you… Heehee… Snrk… Ahahahaha!

Yosuke Hanamura: Haha, damn, dude. It looks great on you!

Teddie: I had a normal pair ready for you. But Yuki-chan insisted on this one. She wouldn’t budge!

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah, real funny, you smartass!

Teddie: Wh-Why are you taking it out on me!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Gimme that!

> Kanji grabbed the other pair of glasses that Teddie was holding…

[It’s the same pair!]

Kanji Tatsumi: ……

Yukiko Amagi: Heehee! Ahahahahaha…!

Teddie: You took my spare pair… Kanji, you must really like those!

Chie Satonaka: Ahaha! Oh, my sides!

Teddie: This is the real one. It wasn’t easy getting it to you.

Kanji Tatsumi: Why the hell did you bother making a spare if it’s more useless crap…!? Dammit! I’ll get you guys for this someday!

Yukiko Amagi: Ahahahaha!

CHAPTER 23: Up Close and Personal
Ryotaro Dojima: Hey, Yu. What’s wrong, bored?

> Since you have Anzu, a Persona of the Hierophant Arcana, you two might get along well…

> You feel your relationship with Dojima is going to become closer soon…

Ryotaro Dojima: You’re that bored… ? Well, have a seat.

> Dojima sighs, but he looks a bit happy. 

Ryotaro Dojima: I was just thinking of making some coffee. All we’ve got is instant, though. How do you take it?

”Black.”
”With cream.”
”Cream and sugar.”
”Surprise me.” ✔

Ryotaro Dojima: Alright, I’ll pour you a good one.

> Dojima looks like he’s having fun.

Nanako Dojima: Dad, the news is starting. Oh, coffee! Can I have some?

Ryotaro Dojima: Sure thing. Plenty of sugar and cream, right?

Nanako Dojima: Yeah!

Ryotaro Dojima: Go watch TV with Nanako. I’ll bring it to you when it’s ready.

”You don’t have to do that.”✔
”Thank you.”

Ryotaro Dojima: Oh, no, it’s okay. Making the coffee is my only job around here.

> Dojima is smiling gently…

Ryotaro Dojima: When I got married, her mother made me promise one thing.  She said this is all I have to do around the house. But nobody else can do it.  So… Well, you know. It’s habit now.

> Dojima looks a bit embarrassed.

> You saw an unexpected side of Dojima and grew closer to him…

> The Ryotaro Dojima Social Link has reached level 4!

> Your power to create Personas of the Hierophant Arcana has grown! 

Ryotaro Dojima: This is the only promise I can really keep these days… Well… anyway. Sit over there.

> You watched TV together.

Announcer: …And now, our next story. On the outskirts of Okina today, a woman bicyclist was hit by a car and died on the scene.

Ryotaro Dojima: Nanako, turn the TV off.

Nanako Dojima: Oh… okay.

Ryotaro Dojima: ……

Nanako Dojima: ……

Nanako Dojima: It was because they showed a story about a traffic accident…  Mom died in an accident.   I don’t remember it. And Dad won’t talk about it…

> Nanako looks lonely…

> You watched some more TV with Nanako before going to your room.

June 7th, 2011. Tuesday. Lunch at school.
Chie Satonaka: Oooh, the instant noodles really hit the spot…

Yukiko Amagi: You know, the rainy season’s just about here.

Yosuke Hanamura: Isn’t it a little early?

Yukiko Amagi: Once it starts, it’ll be raining every night. We’ll have to keep a constant eye on the Midnight Channel.

Yosuke Hanamura: Crap, I didn’t even think of that… Well, so it goes. Hehe, I thought you were worried about the rain ’cause of the school campout.

Chie Satonaka: Why are you so excited about that?

Yukiko Amagi: That’s right, it’s the first time for you two…

Chie Satonaka: You realize the only purpose of the school campout is to ”develop a love for one’s hometown in young people,” right?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, they tell us that up front. So?

Chie Satonaka: Well you see, the way we supposedly develop that love is by picking up trash off the mountain.

Yosuke Hanamura: P-Picking up trash? ”Develop a love” my ass! That’s slave labor!

Chie Satonaka: Well, the night’s kinda fun. We cook our own meals with mess kits and sleep in tents.

Yukiko Amagi: The four of us are in the same group.

Yosuke Hanamura: The same group, huh…? Does that mean we sleep together at night, too!?

Chie Satonaka: You wish! Guys and girls sleep in different tents! I’m warning ya… If you leave your tent at night, you’ll be expelled on the spot.

Yosuke Hanamura: Ugh… This gets worse and worse. I thought it was gonna be fun…

Yukiko Amagi: It’s only for one night and we disband before noon the next day. It doesn’t last very long.

Chie Satonaka: Oh… We did have some fun at the river before going home last year.

Yosuke Hanamura: Do they let you go swimming?

Chie Satonaka: I think so? There’s always someone who takes a dip, although we didn’t.

Yosuke Hanamura: I see… So you can swim in the river…

June 8th, 2011. Wednesday. School.
Mr. Kondo: It’s June already, eh? Well, good news! Tatsumi-kun from the first year is back with us, so try to set good examples! I know it’s the rainy season, and you may not be very motivated, but let’s keep our spirits up together, okay!? Anyway, I really hate this weather since I can’t go out and exercise! But watching sports on TV isn’t bad, either! I saw the heikin-dai competition the other day! They do beautiful moves with a delicate sense of balance! Though, I can see why men would be afraid to try it! Hahahaha!

Yukiko Amagi: ……? Hey, Yu-kun. What sport is ”heikin-dai”?

”Balance Beam.”✔
”High Dive.”
”Uneven Bars.”
”Synchronized Dancing.”

Mr. Kondo: Wow, I’m amazed that you knew that, Yu! But you should ask me if you have questions, Yukiko-chan, not him! Balance beam is ”Heikin-dai” in Japanese! I bet when you kids hear the word ”beam” you think about lasers or something, but it refers to the timber, or beam. And balancing on a wooden beam is mighty tricky… Boom, the sport of balance beam is born.

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, I never really thought of it that way. Interesting! You’re a smart guy, Yu-kun. Thank you.

> Yukiko appreciates you! 

[After classes.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, guess what I just heard! When they’re sitting in back of you, it’s like a squeeze play!

”What’re you talking about?”✔
”Who’s sitting?”
”Putting a baseball team together?”

Yosuke Hanamura: C’mon, you know what I mean. A girl, obviously! No, not that kind of squeeze. I guess it’s more like, smooshing? Sorry, I got ahead of myself. What I mean is… I’m talking about how, when there’s a girl sitting behind you on a motorcycle, they press right up against your back.

”A motorcycle?”
”What does?”

Yosuke Hanamura: Look, don’t make me spell it out! Anyway. I think motorcycles are the hot new thing for guys now. Girls like guys who spend time outdoors, right? So I got you this. Wanna get your license with me, partner?

> It’s a manual for getting a motorcycle license…

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, I can’t afford anything bigger than a scooter on my budget, but at least that’ll let us get to new places. Don’t you think we deserve that much, seeing as how we’re investigating the case?

> Yosuke seems serious about this…

Kanji Tatsumi: ’Sup, Senpai. Hey, about the camping trip… You guys busy right now?

Yosuke Hanamura: Kinda. We’re talking about motorcycles.

Kanji Tatsumi: Motorcycles? You gonna go stomp a gang? If you’re bringin’ a war, I’ll help!

Yosuke Hanamura: No, we’re not ”bringing a war.” What does that mean, anyway? We’re just talking about getting motorcycle licenses!

Kanji Tatsumi: Licenses? You guys don’t have yours?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? No way… Don’t tell me you already…

Kanji Tatsumi: Nah. I’m still 15 and all.

Yosuke Hanamura: Then why’d you say it like that!? Man… That reminds me, I’m surprised you picked a fight with that biker gang. How’d you chase after them?

Kanji Tatsumi: Eh, a bike’s all I need for that.

Yosuke Hanamura: In any case, we can’t let you in on our ”up close and personal” plan.

Kanji Tatsumi: ”Up close and personal”…!? What’s that mean!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Keep it down! Like I was telling this guy, what a guy needs nowadays to be a big man is first a motorcycle, and then…

Kanji Tatsumi: ”And then”…?

Yosuke Hanamura: …A girlfriend.

”Tell me more.”✔
”You’re like a kindergartener.”
”So you’re over her?”

Yosuke Hanamura: Now that’s my partner! Alright, then…

Kanji Tatsumi: You guys gonna get licensed for the big stuff? I mean, I know I came in late here, but if you’re talkin’ about takin’ a girl on a bike, ya gotta be seatin’ two, man. That ain’t allowed on a scooter.

Yosuke Hanamura: …I forgot about that. Shut up! This’ll work out! As long as we have a motorcycle, the girls will come running! That’s all the advantage we’ll need! …Now listen carefully. The reason we don’t have girlfriends is because we’re stuck here in this town, waiting to meet someone! This place is so tiny, it’s no wonder we can’t find one. It doesn’t matter if it’s only a scooter. Some kind of motorcycle is just the ticket for us to get some chicks! Then, later on, we can get a bigger motorcycle… and that’s when the ”up close and personal” plan really starts!

Kanji Tatsumi: Up close and personal…

Yosuke Hanamura: Plus, you know, you and me have more of a city boy thing going on. If we’re serious about this, we’ve gotta expand our horizons to a bigger town. We gotta take the initiative! There’s no time to wait for a train that only leaves every so often each day! We’ll roar up on our motorcycles like the badasses we are, and when the chicks come up, we’ll play it cool… The pheromones dripping off of us will bring them around in no time.

Kanji Tatsumi: (puzzling) F-Feral… zone…?

Yosuke Hanamura: No! We’re not going to a cat house, you idiot. I’m talking about PHEROMONES! My research shows that a motorcycle is the number one surefire way to increase a man’s pheromones!

Kanji Tatsumi: (blushing) Phero… mones…

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude… That’s how a perv would react.

Kanji Tatsumi: What did you say!? Fine! Then, I’m in too! Get ready for Kanji Tatsumi to show his manhood to these chicks!

Yosuke Hanamura: I already told you, you can’t! Anyway, don’t tell anyone about this, got it? If other guys try to copy us, it’ll end up diluting our pheromones. So, partner, make sure you talk to your uncle about getting a license, okay?

Kanji Tatsumi: Got it!

Yosuke Hanamura: Not you! I don’t even know your uncle! I’m serious about this… If we have motorcycles, we can go all over. It’ll be fun!

> It’s true that with a motorcycle, your range of activities will increase somewhat…

Yosuke Hanamura: Man… Somewhere out there, the best days of our youth are ahead of us!

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah! I’m with you on that one!

> Should you try consulting Dojima about the motorcycle tonight…?

[Evening.]

Ryotaro Dojima: Ah, you’re back.

Tohru Adachi: Hi there! You want some eel too? Fair warning: it’s from the supermarket.

Ryotaro Dojima: Well, excuse me.

Tohru Adachi: I-It’s delicious, though! I can’t believe it was on sale!

Ryotaro Dojima: Sorry, but this guy eats instant noodles every day. That constant slurping got on my nerves, so I called him here.

Tohru Adachi: You don’t have to bluff like that. You just wanted to eat dinner with a coworker, right?

Ryotaro Dojima: Don’t be stupid.

Tohru Adachi: But eel was a great choice! Nanako-chan loved it, at least. I’d say she’s eel-ly proud of her daddy! Eh? Ehhhh…? Haha… Did my joke slip away? It is an eel, after all…

Ryotaro Dojima: Just eat your dinner.

Tohru Adachi: Yes, sir. Nanako-chan’s such a good girl, though. She went straight to do her homework once her plate was clean… It’s not every day you get to eat eel. You’d think she would have spent some more time savoring it.

Ryotaro Dojima: You think that because you slack off too much. You should follow her example.

Tohru Adachi: Way to hit where it hurts…

> You need to consult Dojima about getting a motorcycle license…

Ryotaro Dojima: What’s the matter? A motorcycle? You mean a scooter? Oh, that’s right, kids your age can ride those. I don’t know, though…

Tohru Adachi: C’mon, don’t be a spoilsport. It’s no surprise he wants one, out here… I understand how you feel, since I’m from the city myself. The trains don’t run that often, and walking around everywhere is pretty inconvenient, isn’t it?

”Yeah, it’s a hassle.”✔
”It’s not that bad.”

Tohru Adachi: Right? It’s criminal!

Ryotaro Dojima: You say that, but…

Tohru Adachi: That reminds me, I remember you telling me something once, Dojima-san. About some of the reckless things you did on your motorcycle when you were young…

Ryotaro Dojima: You moron! Think before you talk! And once you’re done eating, hurry and-- Ugh… It’s me. ……All right, we’ll be there soon. Looks like I made the right choice to skip the booze… Adachi, you were the one in charge of that file, right?

Tohru Adachi: File? Ohh… Did that suspicious guy show up again?

Ryotaro Dojima: Would you keep your mouth shut? We’re going back. Get in the car.

Tohru Adachi: Back… you mean, to the station!? But I haven’t had my eel liver soup yet…

Ryotaro Dojima: About this license… did you decide on this yourself? No one talked you into it? I know it’s hard without a way to get around. But two-wheeled vehicles can be dangerous… Do you understand?

”I’ll be careful with it.”
”I want you to trust me.”✔

Ryotaro Dojima: It’s not that I doubt you. But allowing you to get one is something else…

> Dojima seems troubled…

Ryotaro Dojima: Don’t give me that face. I know you’re serious about this. First, you’ll need a license. We can talk about this again when you have one. Well, then. Sorry to dump this on you, but I need you to look after the house.

> It’s from Yosuke…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yo, it’s me! How did it go with your uncle? I’ve been on the edge of my seat thinking about it! Seriously!? Then let’s go get ours as soon as we can! I gotta hit the books! Let’s make sure we both pass together!

> Yosuke must really want a motorcycle license…

> You promise to go to the exam site with him tomorrow…

> You wonder about the ”suspicious guy” Adachi mentioned, but there’s no way to find out more about it for now.

> You should review the manual Yosuke gave you and study for the license exam…

June 9th, 2011. Thursday. River Bank.
Yosuke Hanamura: *yawn* Mornin’. Are you awake?

> Yosuke seems sleepy…

Yosuke Hanamura: I went to bed, but little details kept bugging me, so I’d get up again to check the manual. It never ended… I ended up getting almost no sleep at all… Well, if we’re gonna do this, let’s pass
on the first try. How’re you feeling?

”It’ll be a breeze.”✔
”I doubt I’ll pass.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Hehe, now that’s my partner! I see you haven’t forgotten about our ”up close and personal” plan. Well, let’s make sure we’re not late to the exam. We’ll leave as soon as school’s out!

> You decide to head to the exam site.

> You take the license exam with Yosuke…

> ……

> The answers seem to be flowing from your hand!

> You succeeded in passing the exam!

> Obtained Scooter License!

Yosuke Hanamura: Hehe, we passed on the first try, just like we planned! Actually, it was pretty easy. I might’ve studied a little too hard…

[They notice Dojima.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hi. Are you on duty?

Ryotaro Dojima: We just stopped by to get gas. And, well, to take care of some minor business. Where did you guys go?

”To go get our licenses.”✔
”Guess.”

Ryotaro Dojima: Already!? I know it’s just a written test to get a scooter license, but still, I wasn’t expecting you to pass so soon… Oh well… Looks like I’d better think of a way to convince my sister…

”Then you’re okay with this?”✔
”Thank you.”

Ryotaro Dojima: I can’t say no now that you’ve gotten your license. Your enthusiasm is catching.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yes! You got the okay! I need to head home and read through the catalogue…! Well, see you tomorrow!

Ryotaro Dojima: Mind if I borrow you a sec before you head back home? Hey, Adachi!

Tohru Adachi: I just finished filling it up.

Ryotaro Dojima: Sorry for dragging you into this. This is my scooter. I had it fixed at the shop. It may be old, but it runs pretty well. I came to put gas in it, but I wasn’t expecting to hand it over today, too… I’m letting you have it.

”Thank you.”
”This is a nice bike.”✔
”You don’t need it anymore?”

Ryotaro Dojima: You can tell? The local shops don’t carry twist grips, so I had one of the repair guys at work help me out with it in secret. Ah… Don’t tell anyone that, okay?

> Dojima’s passion for the scooter is obvious…

Tohru Adachi: You’re always so strict at the station, but you’re a cool dad inside, huh?

Ryotaro Dojima: Shut up, Adachi!

Tohru Adachi: You always yell at me… Still, I wish we had a sleek means of transportation like that. Who knows when that suspicious guy will show up again? Hasn’t he been using professional-quality cameras to take pictures of people’s houses from the Amagi Inn to around here? Looks like he knows the back streets too, so a car won’t be--

Ryotaro Dojima: Will you stop blabbering like that!? Go back to the car! Well… anyway. I was around your age when I got my license too. I took the test behind my parents’ back. When my dad caught me riding a scooter later on, he gave me a good thrashing… Hahaha. …Don’t tell Nanako about that, okay?

> Dojima is chuckling mischievously.

Ryotaro Dojima: Since I’ve already given the okay, I won’t bug you about traffic laws. Just be safe when you’re riding it. You do that, and I’ll look the other way if you decide to ride it out of town. Can you promise me? Good. I’ll hold you to that.

CHAPTER 24: The Ultimate Decision
[You meet up with Kanji in the school. He’s looking at school’s gym through a window.]

Kanji Tatsumi: Whoa, Yu-senpai! I-I wasn’t peeping inside! It’s not like that! …So, why are you making that scary face at me? Do you have something to tell me?

”Yes, I do.” ✔
”Not really.”

Kanji Tatsumi: …I see. Let’s go somewhere else, then.

> Samegawa flood plain…

> You brought Kanji here to learn the truth behind the rumors…

Kanji Tatsumi: Whaddaya want, dragging me out here? Oh, you here to tell me off or somethin’?

”Something like that.”
”You’re not far off.”
”I’m just here to talk.” ✔

Kanji Tatsumi: How come you’re soundin’ like a cop? So, what is it?

> You asked Kanji about his ties to the gang of bullies…

Kanji Tatsumi: Eh? Bullies? M-Me!? Senpai, you suspecting me!?

”That’s right.”
”I want to believe in you.” ✔
”You heard me!”

Kanji Tatsumi: Senpai… I didn’t do it. I mean… Maybe it ain’t that easy to trust me, since they say I was in a gang… But you gotta believe me… …’s my own fault rumors like that go around, huh…? At this rate, I’ll be causing trouble for you guys…

”Everyone’s like that.”
”Don’t worry about it.” ✔
”It’s no trouble.”

Kanji Tatsumi: Senpai… Uhh… Whenever you got time… Could you maybe hear what I have to say? I feel all cramped inside… And I’m too dumb to know what it’s about…

> Clumsy as he is, it seems Kanji is looking for an opportunity to change…

> You feel a faint bond forming between you and Kanji…

> You have established the Social Link Kanji Tatsumi of the Emperor Arcana!

> You may earn an EXP bonus when fusing Personas of the Emperor Arcana!

> Kanji’s determination in battle has been enhanced… 

Kanji Tatsumi: To make sure I don’t cause you any trouble… Huh… Well, I guess I should smack that gang of bullies around?

> You talked with Kanji for a while and went home.

June 10th, 2011. Friday. Near the school.
Chie Satonaka: Hey! Yo! Who do you think’ll show up on the Midnight Channel next? I heard it’s going to rain this evening, but it’s not going to last all night. Hey, have you been trying to solve the case on your own in your spare time? I know, I should be thinking about it, too. But that kind of stuff just isn’t my specialty. How about you?

”I’m good at reasoning.”
”Thinking hurts my brain.”✔

Chie Satonaka: Me too! I move before I think. Well, everyone has strengths and weaknesses. I’ll stick to kicking things. Times like this are perfect for working out!

Chie Satonaka: Yooo, Yu-kun. Whatcha doin’?

> It seems Chie isn’t busy… 

> Since you have Slime, a Persona of the Chariot Arcana, you feel you could become closer…

> Will you spend the afternoon with Chie?

Chie Satonaka: Then you wanna train?

> You feel your relationship with Chie is going to become closer soon… 

> Central shopping district, in front of Chinese Diner Aiya…

> You finished today’s training and decided to stop by with Chie…

Chie Satonaka: Steak bowl or a combo plate… The ultimate decision…

Familiar voice: S-Stop it…!

Threatening voice: Shut up, dumbass.

Young man’s voice: Yeah, that’s right. We all know it’s time to cough up.

Young man’s voice: What? This’s it? Quit bullshitting us.

Chie Satonaka: Th-That voice… It can’t be…! Let’s go, Yu-kun! Takeshi…!?

Punk: Hey, someone’s here.

Punk leader: Whatever. Let’s take their money while we’re at it.

Punk: This guy only had 1,000 yen on him.

Takeshi: Ch-Chie!

Punk: Hey!

Punk leader: Whaddaya runnin’ for? Gonna hide behind a girl, huh?

Chie Satonaka: Are you all right?

Takeshi: I-I’m fine… Y-You’ve always been good at stuff like this! Th-They took all my money. You’re gonna get them for me, right!?

Chie Satonaka: Well, it does tick me off!! Hey, cowards! Ganging up on one guy… You oughtta be ashamed!

Takeshi: T-Take care of them for me!

Chie Satonaka: Uh, wow, that was fast!

Chie Satonaka: …Sheesh! C’mon, what’s the matter? Let’s throw down!

Punk leader: Huh? What’s with this bitch? Y’think you’re all that? I ain’t afraid to hit a girl… We’ll kick your ass!

> The punks are aggravated by Chie’s taunt…

> Things aren’t looking good…

Hold Chie back
Fight them yourself ✔

Chie Satonaka: Huh…? Yu-kun?

> Chie seems discontent…

Punk leader: What a pain in the ass…

Punk: Yo, that guy who ran away might call the cops.

Punk leader: Screw this. Let’s go.

Chie Satonaka: Hey, hold on! Wait!! What the heck… Running away when you step in. …Why’d you butt in? What, you thought you couldn’t leave it up to me!? I could’ve handled them myself! …Sorry. I charged in by myself… Caused you trouble…

”It’s no trouble.” ✔
”I’m used to it.”
”Just think next time.”

Chie Satonaka: …Thanks.

> Chie looks apologetic…

Chie Satonaka: You’re right, huh? I gotta remember I’m not alone… It’s always like that. Everyone’s doing their best… Then I start to worry that it’s all up to me… and I’ve gotta work harder… I worry that someday, I’ll end up causing even more trouble, like I did today… Haha… I’m so stupid.

> It seems Chie regrets her grandstanding…

> You felt Chie’s quiet passion…

> Your power to create Personas of the Chariot Arcana has grown!

> Chie’s determination in battle has been enhanced…

> Chie can now endure a mortal blow during battle! 

Chie Satonaka: Yu-kun… Thank you. Umm… N-Never mind! I need to work harder, huh? Why am I moping…? I’ll think about it some. …Though I’m not too smart!

> You walked home partway with Chie.

June 12th, 2011. Sunday. Your room.

[Yukiko calling.]

Yukiko Amagi: Hello, this is Yukiko. I’m sorry to call you so suddenly. Do you have time to come out today?

”Sure.”

”I’ll pass.” ✔

Yukiko Amagi: I see… I hope I’m not interrupting anything. I’ll see you at school.

> Yukiko hung up.

[Downstairs.]

> It seems Dojima is looking for something…

Ryotaro Dojima: It was there before… Those damn kids… Don’t they teach ’em how to file data anymore? Oh… Sorry, I wasn’t talking about you.

”Looking for something?”
”Can I help?” ✔
”Working at home?”

Ryotaro Dojima: No… It’s okay. Don’t worry about it.

> Dojima is smiling wryly.

Ryotaro Dojima: I was trying to find an old newspaper article… It was falling apart, so I made a copy, but… The copy seems to have gone missing… There’s a certain case where we don’t have a suspect yet… And since the trail’s going cold, it’s about to be buried under newer cases. But I can’t give up on this one. …Ever.

> Dojima has a cornered look on his face…

> This doesn’t seem to be the time or the place to ask him more about it.

Nanako Dojima: Dad…?

Ryotaro Dojima: Hm? What’s wrong?

Nanako Dojima: My stomach hurts…

Ryotaro Dojima: Was it something you ate!?

Nanako Dojima: It feels like a sharp pain below my stomach.

Ryotaro Dojima: What!? I’ll call the doc-- N-No, wait. This happened before. Is it the same feeling!?

Nanako Dojima: I don’t know…

Ryotaro Dojima: Urgh… Okay, the medicine we used before is-- Dammit! Who’s calling at this time of night…? Dojima here! What’s this about? …A sealed letter? For me? Is it from Ichihara-san!? When did it come!? You forgot!? I’m on my way! Gotta go. The medicine should be in the first aid kit… She’s in your hands.

> Dojima left…

> You gave Nanako the medicine and put her to bed…

> ……

> A few hours later…

Ryotaro Dojima: *sigh*

> Dojima has come home.

> He seems to be in a bad mood…

Ryotaro Dojima: … You’re still up?

Ryotaro Dojima: It’s late. Go to sleep.

”Are you okay?”
”What was that about?”
”But Nanako…” ✔

Ryotaro Dojima: Shut up! Now’s not the time… No… Sorry. It’s something personal with me…

> Dojima looks apologetic…

Ryotaro Dojima: How’s Nanako…? She’s sleeping… Good. You’ve been a great help here.

> Dojima seems to bear a heavy burden… What is he keeping locked up in his heart…?

> You feel your bond with Dojima has deepened even further…

> The Ryotaro Dojima Social Link has reached level 5!

Ryotaro Dojima: It’s pretty late. Go hit the hay.

Ryotaro Dojima: …’Night, Yu.

> You said goodnight to Dojima and went to your room.

June 13th, 2011. Monday.
> Today is the day people begin wearing their summer clothes.

> Your summer outfit is in your dresser.

[At school.]

Mr. Kondo: Good afternooooon! Are you all awake today? June in Japan can be pretty tiring, thanks to all the humidity and heat! But don’t waste your days away with laziness! Summer is very near, my friends! Speaking of mold, lactic acid bacteria are effective in treating mold! The lactic acid they produce guards against mold! That’s why foods containing lactic acid bacteria don’t get very moldy! Your bodies also produce lactic acid when you exercise! All right, Yu! Tell me what kind of exercise builds up lactic acid in the muscles!

”Anaerobics.” ✔
”Aerobics.”
”Oxyrobics.”

Mr. Kondo: That’s right! Anaerobic exercise, like strength training, builds up lactic acid in the muscles! Aerobic exercise, such as jogging, uses lactic acid as energy, so it is hard to build up! All right, now that we’ve learned about lactic acid, everyone do 10 dashes! It’s time for some anaerobic exercise! If you produce lactic acid with anaerobic exercise, your body will be clean and mold-free!

> You answered correctly…

> Your Knowledge has increased.

CHAPTER 25: Okina Babe Hunt
June 14th, 2011. Thursday.
> Yasogami High drama club…

> You participated in the acting exercises.

> You thoroughly practiced expressing a variety of emotions…

Drama club president: I know it’s a bit early, but we’re at a good place to stop. Why don’t we call it a day?

Yumi Ozawa: No! The bell hasn’t rung yet! You want to quit early? You’re slacking off! You need to take this more seriously!

Drama club vice president: Y-Yumi, maybe you’ve been working too hard…

Yumi Ozawa: I feel like I’m the only one who cares about this club! Stop holding us back! The reason you never get any lead roles is because you act like that!

Drama club president: Yumi!

Yumi Ozawa: Oh…

School PA: It is time to go home. Please, don’t forget anything.

Drama club vice president: L-Look, it’s time to go home now, anyway. Let’s all just stop for today, all right?

Club members: Okay.

> Yumi stands, silent and unmoving.

Yumi Ozawa: …Was I wrong when I said that?

”Yeah.”
”No.”
”It was how you said it.” ✔

Yumi Ozawa: Maybe you’re right. …I practice controlling my emotions in this club, and it still doesn’t help me in real life…

> Yumi smiles wryly.

Yumi Ozawa: I’ll… keep practicing. At the riverbank or somewhere… Anywhere but at home.

”Is something wrong?”
”Your family will be worried.”
”I’ll help.” ✔

Yumi Ozawa: No… But thanks.

> Yumi smiles…

Yumi Ozawa: There’s no one there. I don’t have a family to worry about me…

> Yumi trembles slightly…

Yumi Ozawa: …There’s nobody at my house. Mom’s been going straight to the hospital after work, to see HIM. There’s no real point to going home now… …When I’m by myself at home, I can’t stop thinking about all that stuff. The past… Why things turned out the way they did… You know. I thought I’d forgotten them… Sorry… I’ve just been whining… Just forget about this, okay?

”Okay.”
”I can’t forget.” ✔

Yumi Ozawa: That’s mean! Can’t you be a little nicer to a girl?

> Yumi seems to have cheered up a little.

Yumi Ozawa: I have my acting. That’s how I can keep going. No matter what happens, I will go on! Yeah, that’s right! Thank you, Yu-kun! If I was by myself, I’d have been down in the dumps for a while, I just know it. So, um… I’m glad you were here. Haha… I hope you’ll stick around for a while longer.

> It seems you were able to help support Yumi…

> You feel that your relationship with Yumi has deepened slightly…

> The Yumi Ozawa Social Link has reached level 4!

> Your power to create Personas of the Sun Arcana has grown! 

Yumi Ozawa: I’m going to stop somewhere on my way home and practice some more there. I finally got a lead role! I have to make sure I can do it! Alright!

> You left Yumi and went home.

June 15th, 2011. Wednesday. On the way to school.
Yosuke Hanamura: Yo, partner! Hehe, wait ’til you hear this. I finally got a motorcycle! My very own, just like I’ve been dreaming about! I’ve been on cloud nine all morning. So, why don’t we take our motorcycles for a spin out to Okina after school? You know, you once promised you would…

”When did I promise that?”
”The up close and personal plan, eh?” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, you remembered! That’s my partner! It’s time to put our ”let’s use motorcycles to hit on city girls” plan in action! I want to make sure I have a girlfriend to spend the summer with this year! Don’t you!? Let’s head there as soon as classes let out!

[Morning. School.]

Mr. Morooka: School camp will be taking place this weekend. Remember, this isn’t like ordinary camping. It’s going to be a place of education to wind up the lazy ass minds you get from screwing around all the time. I’ll show you what morals are all about! And I’ll send home anyone who brings down the morale! You remember that! …What? You don’t know the difference between ”morals” and ”morale”? Morals are about virtue! Morale is… Tell me, Hanamura! You seem to be lacking in morals!

Yosuke Hanamura: Dammit, King Moron! I thought I knew, but now I’m doubting myself! Sorry, Yu, tell me what morale is!

”A reward.”
”The desire to grow.”
”Cheerfulness in a group.” ✔
”Gambling spirit.”

> You gave him the answer you think is correct.

Mr. Morooka: Hoh, that was unexpected… Did you tell him the answer, Yu? Anyway, yes, morale refers to the enthusiasm of a group or an individual within a group. You remember when those women were killed? It’s shit like that that brings down people’s morale! And their morals! And maybe that’ll all happen to you if you keep living lives of low morals and low morale!

> Yosuke appreciates you!

> You feel you’ve become a little closer to Yosuke…

[After school.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hello, Okina Station! That was easier than I thought! (sees Kanji on a bicycle) He actually followed us all the way here…

Kanji Tatsumi: That was a breeze! It’s no sweat keepin’ up with a couple of guys still gettin’ used to their scooters.

Yosuke Hanamura: Psh! If I hadn’t run out of gas back there, we’d have left you in the dust! …I shouldn’t have cheaped out on gas just so I could have more money to fool around with.

Kanji Tatsumi: Y’know, I notice every time I come here, there’s a lot of people around.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, if we hang out around here, I bet someone will come talk to us!

Kanji Tatsumi: Actually, uh… mind if I head off for a bit? Since I came all the way to Okina, uhh… th-there’s this craft shop… It’s nothin’! I’m just sayin’ I gotta go buy some stuff! Anyway, I’m gonna go do my own thing for a bit, so you guys get started without me!

Yosuke Hanamura: Then… why’d he come with us…?

”Don’t worry about it.” ✔
”Our plan’s more important.”

Yosuke Hanamura: You’re right! Okay, let’s get this plan underway!

> You decide to wait here for a while.

> The early summer sunlight feels nice…

> …Three hours passed.

> The early summer sunlight beats down…

Kanji Tatsumi: Sorry to make you guys wait! I couldn’t decide which one to get… No luck, huh?

Yosuke Hanamura: This is so weird. I think someone’s watching us from somewhere, though.

”I don’t get that at all.”
”That seems… unlikely.” ✔
”I want to go home.”

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hold on! I’m sure if we hang around a little longer…

Kanji Tatsumi: Dude, the sun’s gonna set… Maybe there’s some holes in your plan after all.

”It’s Yosuke’s fault.”
”It’s Kanji’s fault.”
”Is it my fault?” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Nah, you’re fine! Your motorcycle looks cool, and you don’t look so bad yourself.

Kanji Tatsumi: Does it, like, not nutter what kind of motorcycle it is, as long as you got one?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well… it’s true that the ones I saw in the magazine were all big motorcycles.

Yosuke Hanamura: But that’s just how it goes! There’s always a gap between a man’s dream and cold, hard reality. I can’t afford an expensive one! A scooter’s the best I could do!

Kanji Tatsumi: Senpai, can you give me ten minutes? I can’t keep quiet after gettin’ shut out like this. I’ll avenge you guys!

Yosuke Hanamura: This isn’t a fight, you know. What’re you gonna do to ”avenge” us? Hit on some girls?

Kanji Tatsumi: Hell yeah! How else would I fix this?

Yosuke Hanamura: C’mon… We have motorbikes and we failed. There’s no way you could do better. Right?

”Keep dreaming, Kanji.”
”I’ll do the avenging here.”
”Three minutes is all I need.” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: What’re you saying!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Even instant ramen takes five minutes to make! Now that’s my Senpai. Let’s make this a contest. I’ll show you clowns how a real man gets it done!

Yosuke Hanamura: Calm down! This is turning into something we’ve all got a stake in. I mean, do you realize what you’re saying? This means we’re the ones that have to approach the girls.  That just sounds lame… and I doubt it’ll go well for us…

Kanji Tatsumi: Ya chicken?

Yosuke Hanamura: That’s not what I mean…

Kanji Tatsumi: All we gotta do is ask them to be our friend. And then make ’em say ”yes.” Nothin’ to it.

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, I guess there’s nothing to lose…

Kanji Tatsumi: That’s the spirit, Senpai! And if I lose, I’ll run around the block in nothin’ but my underwear and those gag glasses Yukiko-senpai had!

Yosuke Hanamura: …Only girls count for this, all right?

Kanji Tatsumi: You’re still stuck on that!? Dammit! Hell if I’m gonna lose this!

> In a strange turn of events, the three of you are having a pickup contest…!

> You can’t lose this challenge.

> You need to at least get their contact information…

Flamboyant high school girl: And that guy trying to pick me up was such a loser. That nose piercing of his made him look like a cow!

Loud high school girl: Hahahaha! That sounds awful ! What did he think he was, Inaba beef?

> A couple of flashy high school girls are here. Will you talk to them…?

Flamboyant high school girl: What the hell? Who are you? Are you hitting on us?

Loud high school girl: Well… He is kinda cute. We’re not doing anything right now, so maybe we could hang out.

Flamboyant high school girl: I haven’t seen you around. Where do you live?

”Inaba.” ✔
”Okina.”
”……”

Loud high school girl: Haha, Inaba, he says! What a redneck! That’s too funny! I heard Inaba’s so dead, the farm animals have taken over! Four legs good, two legs bad!

Loud high school girl: Ahahahahahaha! That’s like that book! Let me hear you squeal, country boy!

”Don’t. Mock. Inaba.”
”Squeal? ”
”If you say so!” ✔

> You went with the flow and gave a squeal.

> Your Courage has increased.

Flamboyant high school girl: Ahahahaha! You’re so funny!

Loud high school girl: Oink oink! Sooooo-eeeeee! Whatever you Inaba people do to keep your pig overlords happy! That was a good one! I bet you’re one of the pigs’ pets in Inaba!

> You seem to have hit it off with the girls!

> You spoke to the girls for a while…

Loud high school girl: Hey, give me your cell number. I’ll call you when I’m bored.

”If I can get yours, too.” ✔
”No thanks. ”

Flamboyant high school girl: What? Why do we have to give you ours? Like I said, we’ll call YOU. Don’t be so desperate, geez.

Loud high school girl: Come on, give me your number! I’ll call you when we’re bored, and you’ll be there in five minutes to entertain us. Simple, huh?

Flamboyant high school girl: If you’re late, I’ll post your number to an online dating site!

> You feel the situation is turning ugly. It seems wise to run away.

> You were somehow able to extricate yourself from the girls…

> You didn’t get their phone numbers…

> A little time passed…

Older lady: Gosh dangit! Nothing today, again…

> There’s an older woman here. Maybe you should talk to her…

Older lady: Oh? Can I help you? You seem young… How old are you? What do you do?

”I’m a fresh-faced high schooler.”
”I’m a go-getting college student.” ✔
”I’m a hard-working adult.”

Older lady: Hmm… Well, you meet the age requirement. And the height and looks requirements. I guess the only thing left is your potential to become great someday…

> The woman keeps looking at you.

Older lady: Are you the oldest child? Second oldest? What’s your family structure like? Do you live with your parents? Is your parents’ house a rental, or do they own? Is it a house or an apartment?

> The woman has a rapid-fire stream of questions…!

Older lady: Oh, sorry! I just like knowing these things. Just so as not to give you the third degree here, let me introduce myself. I’m a… homemaking assistant… by trade and my hobbies are gardening and traveling. And I’m a groovy, hip, with-it 23-year-old!

> Something rings strange about what she just said…

> Is she really 23 years old?

Older(?) lady: I’ve really been lonely lately… My bed feels so empty. I’ve played around with guys before, but I can’t live my whole life as a tease. So I thought I should settle down…

> She is looking at you expectantly.

”I’m your man.”
”What’s normal about that?”
”Wow. Where’s your pick and pan?” ✔

> Your Courage has increased.

Older(?) lady: Hey, if you keep saying things like that, I might burst into tears! If you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all! Hehe.

> The woman winked at you…

Older(?) lady: Oh, do you like kids? How many do you want when we get married? I actually have my half of a marriage license all filled out and ready to go. I’m game whenever you are. Actually, do you want to sign it now?

> This like a good time to come clean about the fact that you’re in high school…

Older(?) lady: WHAT!? Second year of high school? You’re just a kid! Don’t make passes at me, you stupid little boy! If you’re under eighteen, you’re under my limit. Go talk to someone else.

> The woman’s attitude suddenly changed…

> You should give up on asking for her number…

> There’s a neatly dressed girl here. Will you talk to her?

Neatly dressed girl: Oh… Oh, I’m sorry. Can I help you with something?

”Wanna talk?” ✔
”I came to hit on you.”

Neatly dressed girl: Umm… Uhh… I’m… uh… not used to this…

> The woman looks embarrassed.

Neatly dressed girl: Sorry, I’m really nervous. Um. I can’t really explain it.

”Are you alright?” ✔
”Calm down.”

Neatly dressed girl: S-Sure. Yes, it is at times like these that one must be at one’s calmest. I must regain the balance in my heart, or evil will rush in. Mmmmmmm… Hhhhhhhh…

> The woman started to breathe deeply.

Neatly dressed girl: Phew… I’m all right now. My soul has been saved through God’s intervention. Are you aware of this? At this very moment, our world is filled with demons and despair. That despair will invade peoples’ souls. Eventually, the world will become hard and cruel. Illness, accidents, bad luck… all evil in this world from despair. I’m sure that your soul’s cries for hope are brought you to me.

> The woman seems serious…

Neatly dressed girl: However, you must not fear. There is still a path to salvation. If you pray to our God, your soul will be purified and you will be able to lead a happy, fulfilled life.

> The woman’s pure eyes gleam at you…

Neatly dressed girl: The time is now! Find your happy place and gain inner joy!

> You feel that you are in danger…

> You ran from the preaching woman!

> You didn’t get her cell phone number…

> A little time passed…

> There’s a gorgeous woman here. Will you talk to her?

Beautiful lady: Hm…? What does a cute boy like you want with me?

”Are you alone?” ✔
”I’m hitting on you.”
”It’s love at first sight!”

Beautiful lady: Well, I’m waiting for someone. Haha, are you making a pass at me? I kind of like younger boys. They’re innocent, and adorable… It makes me want to educate them about some things. Hmm… How do you feel about older women?

”I love them.” ✔
”Not too interested…”
”Age means nothing.”

Beautiful lady: Oh, really? Then we might be a good match, hahah. Hey… Do you really want to hang out? Not today, I mean, and not if you don’t want to. But if you want… I could teach you a lot about how grown-ups play…

> Things are going well.

> One more push, and you may be able to get her number.

Beautiful lady: Haha, well? Do you want to play with me?

”Yes, please. ”
”What will we play?” ✔

Beautiful lady: Haha, I think it’ll be easier to show you than to explain… But I have something to do right now, so this isn’t the best day… Maybe next time.

> This is your chance to ask her for her phone number…

Beautiful lady: Alright, here you go, just for you. Call me, won’t you?

> You got the lady’s cell phone number!

Beautiful lady: I’ll be waiting.

> You took more time than expected.

> You need to meet up with your friends…

Yosuke Hanamura: …How’d it go?

Kanji Tatsumi: Not as well as I hoped.

Yosuke Hanamura: I thought so…

Kanji Tatsumi: Oh, but I did get a phone number from some chick who said to give her a call… Does that count?

Yosuke Hanamura: A girl hit on you!? What did she say!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Somethin’ like it only costin’ so much for an hour, I dunno… What was she talkin’ about?

Yosuke Hanamura: How dense are you!? There’s no way that counts! What about you? Did you get anything?

”Of course.” ✔
”Nothing at all…”
”I’m not telling.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Way to go, partner! Was it her cell? What kind of girl was it? C’mon, you should call her up!  Please?  …Pretty please?  PLEASE!?

Kanji Tatsumi: How many times are you gonna beg…?

> You decide to try and call the number you got…

Yosuke Hanamura: She picked up…!

Kanji Tatsumi: Senpai’s the man…

Man’s voice: Uhh, hello?

> You hear an unfamiliar man’s voice on the other end of the line…

”Hello?” ✔
”Who’re you?”
”Let me talk to the girl.”

Man’s voice: Oh, I get it… it’s you, huh? You rat bastard! You’re dead, shitbird! How dare you hit on my girl!? I’ll rip off your head and spit down yer neck! You better not call again, got it!?

Yosuke Hanamura: I could hear him from here…

Kanji Tatsumi: Was that dude for real…?

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Well, haha… That’s the risk you take! All right, I’m up next! Last chance!

Kanji Tatsumi: You pulled it off, Yosuke-senpai!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Heheh, of course I did. One phone number, right here!

Kanji Tatsumi: Amazing!

Yosuke Hanamura: Man, it wasn’t easy, too. She was crazy hot.  I just had to push myself a bit and go for a sexy, older woman.  Time to give her a call! I hope you guys are ready for this.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hello? It’s me!

Girl’s voice: Yosuke-kun?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yep! The guy who asked you out on a motorcycle ride! Man, I can’t wait. Huh? You know my name? Did I tell you?

Girl’s voice: Of course I know your name. We go to the same school.

Yosuke Hanamura: We do? That’s impossible. I mean, you… Wait… that voice…

Girl’s voice: This is Hanako Ohtani. Who did you think I was? How’d you get my number?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh god, I am in such deep shit… D-Did I call the wrong number? O-One more try…! Hello? It’s me!

Hanako?: Yeah, I know who you are. You really want to go on a date with me that much?

Kanji Tatsumi: …What the hell was that? It sounded like a fiend from the pits of the earth… I could feel a chill go down my spine…

Yosuke Hanamura: Forget about it… for your own sake. This number is dangerous… It’s better that you don’t know what that was.

[A fat girl in a school uniform comes up to them.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hanako…san!? Why’re you here…?

Hanako: The countryside’s no place for a girl like me. I was taking a walk when I suddenly got a phone call. You’re really into me, aren’t you? A motorcycle date, huh… Well, if you want to take a ride that bad, I’ll go with you.

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Wait…! N-Noooooooooooo! M-My motorcycle…!

[She sits on the scooter and completely destroys it.]

Hanako: What’s with this scooter? It’s broken. If you want to take me out, you’ve gotta do better than that. The best girls don’t go steady for nothing, you know. You need to make an effort.

[Hanako leaves with an offended look.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Am I cursed…? Did I insult a gypsy or something…?

”It’s a curse.”
”Cheer up.”
”Let’s just go home.” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Ha…haha… Easy for you to say. I don’t even have a way to get home now…

Kanji Tatsumi: Senpai… You fought well. I was totally moved by all that. C’mon, hop on behind me, I’ll get you back home safe. Whoa… Up close and personal…! I get it now! So this is what your plan was about!

Yosuke Hanamura: You don’t get anything! And you’re freaking me out! And dude, it’s against the law to have two people on a bike! It’s okay… Just put an end to this suffering already…

> You saw Yosuke off to the station and decided to go home with Kanji…

> You should be able to come to Okina on your own now, if you have enough experience with your scooter…

CHAPTER 26: School Camping Trip
[Evening. Dojima’s house.]

Nanako Dojima: Hey, big bro. …Why do people die?

> Is Nanako talking about her mother, who died in an accident?

> Nanako is looking straight at you…

> This is a difficult question for a girl Nanako’s age to understand…

> But, with your level of Expression, you were able to explain it to her.

> You decided to talk to Nanako about life and death…

Nanako Dojima: I see… This is hard… But I get it! Thank you, big bro!

> Nanako is nodding her head cheerfully.

”Why all these questions?”
”Is there anything else?” ✔

Nanako Dojima: Well, ummm… Oh, there is!

> Nanako’s eyes are gleaming…

Nanako Dojima: What happens to a person… when they die?

”They disappear.”
”They go to heaven.” ✔
”I don’t know.”

Nanako Dojima: So, it is true. Mommy went to heaven.

> Nanako is smiling happily…

Nanako: Oh, yeah, I saw this on the news: ”Robbery at the post office.” ……Why do bad people do bad things?

”They have no choice.”
”Because they enjoy it.”
”I don’t know.” ✔

Nanako Dojima: I see… You’re not a bad person, so I guess you wouldn’t know.

> Nanako looks relieved.

Nanako Dojima: But if there were no bad people, Dad would be home more… Last year, there weren’t many crimes, so Dad was here a lot. He used to pick me up from kindergarten… Are bad people more important to Dad than I am?

”That’s not true.”
”He’s protecting everyone.”
”He’s protecting you.” ✔

Nanako Dojima: …I don’t get it.

> Nanako is thinking.

Nanako Dojima: ……

> It seems that Nanako is bearing her sadness stoically…

> You feel that you understand a bit of Nanako’s loneliness…

Nanako Dojima: …Let’s talk about something else, big bro.

> You decided to talk about something different with the lonely-looking Nanako…

June 16th, 2011. Monday. Early morning.
Yukiko Amagi: Good morning, Yu-kun. School camp starts tomorrow. We’ll be in the same group, but what should we be cooking for dinner? Hey, why don’t we get everyone and go buy ingredients after school?

”We should do that.” ✔
”You should do everything.”

Yukiko Amagi: Okay. I’ll be sure to let Chie and Yosuke-kun know, then.

[After school.]

>Junes grocery department…

> You came with the others to buy ingredients for the cookout tomorrow.

Chie Satonaka: What do you put in curry again?

Yukiko Amagi: Carrots, potatoes, onions… mushrooms, green peppers, and… radishes?

Chie Satonaka: Are radishes… the same as turnips?

> They’re apparently going to make curry.

Chie Satonaka: Curry’s fine, right? It’s practically our national food.

Yukiko Amagi: We were going back and forth between ramen and curry, but I thought ramen might not be enough for you guys.

Chie Satonaka: Hmm, I wonder what kind of ingredients Yosuke likes… I get the feeling he’s real picky.

Yukiko Amagi: He’s on another floor, isn’t he? Do you want me to go ask?

Chie Satonaka: Nah, no need. Plus, he said he needed to get ready for something.

Yukiko Amagi: ……Hey, Chie. You use potato starch for curry, right?

Chie Satonaka: ……? O-Of course you do.

Yukiko Amagi: Otherwise, the sauce wouldn’t thicken. Then, we need potato starch and… some flour, too?

Chie Satonaka: Th-There’s… different kinds of flour… Which one should we get? All-purpose? Whole wheat?

Yukiko Amagi: Hm, whole wheat sounds healthy. Let’s get that one. And… here they are! Chili peppers! It’s not curry if it isn’t spicy.

Chie Satonaka: Oh well… Let’s just get everything that seems right. How about some kimchi, too? Ooh, and some ground pepper!

Yukiko Amagi: There’s two kinds, though. Black and white.

Chie Satonaka: Whoa! Way to go, Yukiko… The Amagi family sure knows their stuff! Let’s get both, just in case.

Yukiko Amagi: Oh yeah… We’ll need some special ingredients, too, to spice things up.

Chie Satonaka: Hmm, I remember seeing something on TV about that… I think it was… umm, chocolate… coffee… yogurt… How about mint chocolate!? I love that stuff! I don’t like coffee that much, though… Oh, I can drink mocha, so let’s get that.

Yukiko Amagi: What about some seafood? That should make the sauce taste better.

[At camp trip…]

Yosuke Hanamura: Ugh, picking up all that trash was murder on my back… I can’t believe someone threw away an entire bike. Dammit, litterers should have to deal with their own garbage… Anyways, time for dinner! Man, I’m starvin’. Dude, the girls cooked just for us! Not that I expect much outta Chie, but Yukiko’s got the full tradition of the Amagi Inn behind her food! You know it’s gonna be out of this world!

”You shouldn’t eat it.”
”I’ll give you mine too.”
”I suddenly feel ill…” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hey, what’s the matter? Is it okay if I have yours? I can’t wait to dig in!

Yukiko Amagi: Should we… taste this?

Chie Satonaka: Huh? O-Only if you do it first…

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh man, here it comes!

Chie Satonaka: Uhhh, sorry for the wait. Um… We… put a lot of love into it…

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa, really? That’s kinda cliched, but still awesome! Okay then, chow time! Urh, agh, aaarghraaaaw!

Chie Satonaka: H-Hey…?

Yosuke Hanamura: WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!? I mean, what kinda--*cough cough* Curry’s supposed to be like ”really spicy” or ”kinda mild”… This just stinks! And it’s gritty too! It’s somehow both gritty and slimy… And it’s got squishy parts in it… It’s so frickin’ nasty I can’t even swallow it!

Chie Satonaka: Well, it just didn’t mix too well… But it does offer a wide variety of textures…

Yosuke Hanamura: It’s nauseating!

Chie Satonaka: C’mon, it’s not THAT bad…! That’s just your opinion!

Yosuke Hanamura: I’m telling you as a friend… Don’t do it. I wouldn’t even joke about trying that slop!

> They’re looking at you with hope in their eyes…

Try it
Decline ✔
Fake eating it

> Chie and Yukiko are staring at you…

> It seems you have no choice but to eat it…

> ……

> The second you put it in your mouth, you sense that something is wrong…

> You can tell after one bite that this isn’t edible…

> There’s no way you can swallow it…

Chie Satonaka: …We’re sorry.

Yukiko Amagi: Sorry…

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* What’re we gonna do? Our group’s the only one without food. I mean, if it was even slightly edible, that’d be one thing… But I’m not taking another bite of this Mystery Food X.

Chie Satonaka: Something smells good…!

Yosuke Hanamura: Hanako…! …I don’t have any choice. And besides she owes me, considering what she did to my motorcycle. H-Hey… Uh, Hanako? You… wouldn’t happen to have any extra curry left, huh? C’mon, give us some! We’re begging you! We’re starving to death here!

Hanako: No way. I’m on a diet right now, so this is all that I made. It has to last me.

Chie Satonaka: All that you made…? It’s like a bucketful…

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* I wonder if there’s any way we can get something delivered here.

Yukiko Amagi: But our cell phones don’t get service up here…

Chie Satonaka: And dinnertime’s almost over…

Mr. Morooka: Alright, back to your tents! Men’s tents are this way, and the girls’ tents are that way! Come on, people, look alive! Youngsters like yourselves should hurry up and get to bed after they eat!It’s now time for us teachers to have some boo--I mean, err, off to bed! Lights out!

Yosuke Hanamura: You guys are gonna pay for this…

Chie Satonaka: A-Ahaha… haha. …Night.

> School camp, at dusk…

> Inside Yu and Yosuke’s tent…

Yosuke Hanamura: Dammit… I’m so hungry… And how the hell did you end up here?

Kanji Tatsumi: My teach threatened to hold me back a year if I didn’t show. And the first-year’s tent is all quiet, like someone died.

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, if you were in there with ’em, I’m not surprised…

Kanji Tatsumi: Is it just you two in this tent?

Yosuke Hanamura: The other guys called in sick. Smart move…

Kanji Tatsumi: So it’s okay if I hang out here?

”Stay as long as you want.” ✔
”Only for a little while.”

Kanji Tatsumi: Hey, you’re a stand-up guy, Senpai.

Kanji Tatsumi: Don’t worry, I won’t make any trouble for you. They won’t catch me unless we raise a ruckus.

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* Alright, alright. You can sleep over there.

Kanji Tatsumi: Dude, there’s a huge rock under there. How’m I supposed to sleep? It’s gonna hurt like hell.

Yosuke Hanamura: Pipe down… Didn’t you say you weren’t going to make any noise?

Kanji Tatsumi: Yo Senpai, can’t you go just a little further back?

Yosuke Hanamura: Nope. There’s a slope just past here. I’d roll down the hill in my sleep.

Yosuke Hanamura: If you don’t like it here, go back to the first-year tent.

Kanji Tatsumi: Hey… wasn’t your teacher some guy called King Moron? That guy stopped me outside earlier, and he pissed me off so bad I was about to lose it. He was going on and on about when I was in middle school, when he doesn’t know shit about any of that… Not only that, he was bullshitting about how I’ll be expelled immediately if I cause trouble… That ain’t funny, man.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, that guy’s set a speed record for jumping to conclusions…

Kanji Tatsumi: Check this out, right? I heard it from a guy in my class. He said that asshole was talking shit about the two girls who died.

Yosuke Hanamura: King Moron was talking about Ms. Yamano and Saki-senpai…?

Kanji Tatsumi: It was like, ”It’s no surprise that people who are unfaithful or run away from home meet a bad end…” I dunno, maybe he was exaggerating. Everyone seems to hate that son of a bitch Morooka.

Yosuke Hanamura: Damn, I can just picture him saying that… He never shut up about me either when I moved here last year. Not that I remember anything he said…

Kanji Tatsumi: Even if it’s only a little true, it still pisses me off… The dickhead’s a damn teacher, for god’s sake.

Yosuke Hanamura: Ahhh, don’t waste your energy getting pissed at that clown. *munch munch*

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah, you got a point… Wait a sec, what’re you eating!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Animal crackers.

Kanji Tatsumi: What the--!? Those are mine! Dammit, I was so pumped about finding the penguin today…

Yosuke Hanamura: Penguin?

Kanji Tatsumi: The secret animal cracker! You were eating them and you didn’t know that!?

Yosuke Hanamura: A-Are you serious? Well, you shoulda said something!

Kanji Tatsumi: Oh well…

Yosuke Hanamura: Ughhh… This isn’t gonna fill me up… *sigh* Let’s just go to sleep…

Kanji Tatsumi: That’s all you got to say for yourself after taking my snacks…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Kanji, don’t you have more space on your side?

Kanji Tatsumi: Man, I can’t sleep over there, or my back’s gonna break.

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh… Okay. Uh… Hey.

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah?

Yosuke Hanamura: …Why’d you come to this tent?

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? I already told you. Geez… ’s wrong with you?

Yosuke Hanamura: This is as good a time as any, so… I-I want you to be honest with us.

Kanji Tatsumi: Uh… okay?

Yosuke Hanamura: A-Are you really… you know…?

Kanji Tatsumi: Am I really what…?

Yosuke Hanamura: What I mean is, uh… Are we gonna be safe alone with you?

Kanji Tatsumi: Wha--!? Wh-Wh-What the hell’s that supposed to mean!? I-I already told you guys I’m not like that!

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Well then why are you all hot and bothered about it!? That’s just more suspicious!

Kanji Tatsumi: Hell no! We settled this already, dammit! Right now, I’m… Well… How do I put it…? Uh…

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh God, don’t trail off like that! You’re freaking me out!

Kanji Tatsumi: I’m trying to tell you that I have no problem being around girls now!

Yosuke Hanamura: Can you prove it!?

Kanji Tatsumi: P-Prove it…?

Yosuke Hanamura: ’Cause if you can’t, we’re gonna be stuck here all night half scared to death.

Kanji Tatsumi: Tch… To hell with this. If that’s what you really think of me, then I’m gonna go hit the girls’ tent right now!

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Wait, well that’s a little extreme! You don’t have to go that far! They’ll expel you if they find you! Don’t tell me you forgot! King Moron’s got his eye on you!

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah… like that’d stop a man like me!

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude’s seriously going for it… Hey man, you gotta stop him.

”Don’t do this.” ✔
”Go get ’em.”
”Not my problem.”

> You tried to convince Kanji not to go through with it…

> But he’s not listening!

Kanji Tatsumi: Y’think I’m gonna put up with this crap!? I’ll show you guys! To hell with King Moron! No one’s stopping Kanji Tatsumi, dammit! Raaaaaaahhhhh!!

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh, hey! Wait! What a putz. I declare myself not responsible for anything that happens.

> Meanwhile, inside Chie and Yukiko’s tent…

[Hanako snores like a monster.]

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* Now I get why we’re the only three in here…

Yukiko Amagi: I can’t sleep…

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* I’m hungry, too. I should’ve eaten a little more of that curry…

Yukiko Amagi: It might’ve knocked us unconscious…

Chie Satonaka: Sheesh… We can’t sleep, we can’t walk around… I wonder what Teddie’s doing right now. Being alone all day’s pretty rough when you think about it… You know, a while ago he-- Uuuugh… Aaaargh! That does it! Yukiko, we’re outta here.

Yukiko Amagi: Where’d we go, though? I don’t think climbing down the mountain is a good idea… Do you think she’d stop snoring if I covered her nose and mouth?

Chie Satonaka: N-Nonononono! Yukiko, NO! Ugh… I can’t take it anymore… Wh-Who’s there!?

> Back at Yu and Yosuke’s tent…

Familiar voice: Hey… Are you guys still up?

Yosuke Hanamura: What’re you doing here!? This is the guys’ side!

Chie Satonaka: Let us in!

Yosuke Hanamura: Don’t be ridiculous! If King Moron finds out, we’ll all be expelled! Go back to your tent!

Chie Satonaka: We can’t!

Mr. Morooka: Are there any rotten apples out and about!? Any indecent students out there…?

Yosuke Hanamura: A-Alright, hurry up and get in! So, why’re you two here?

Yukiko Amagi: Well, it’s Kanji-kun… He’s out cold…

Chie Satonaka: I-I don’t know what happened! He just came in and then, and then… h-he fainted all of a sudden. That’s all. Right, Yukiko?

Yukiko Amagi: Huh? Y-Yeah.

Chie Satonaka: So there was no way we could sleep with him lying there, and you know… If we woke him up, he might’ve made a fuss. That’s why we left him there.

Yosuke Hanamura: What? That makes no sense. He busted into your tent, then suddenly fainted?

Mr. Morooka: Listen up! Being insolent and being indecent are very different things!

Yosuke Hanamura: It’s him! He’s right outside! H-Hey, turn the light off!

> ……

> You can sense King Moron getting closer…

Mr. Morooka: Hey, are you two in there? Answer me!

”We’re here.”
”We’re not here.” ✔

Mr. Morooka: Huh…? Ahhh, so you’re in there… Is Hanamura already asleep?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yessir! Fast asleep, Sir!

Mr. Morooka: Don’t get cute, Hanamura! Shut up and go back to sleep. *yaaawwn* Ugh, I think I had one too many. I’m so sleepy…

> ……

> It seems that King Moron left…

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* There goes a couple years off my lifespan.

Chie Satonaka: No joke… We were nearly expelled…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, this is you guys’ fault!

Chie Satonaka: Wh-What else were we supposed to do!? Anyways, we can’t leave now. We’ll sneak out before the others wake up tomorrow. Is that good enough for you!?

Yosuke Hanamura: What’re you so pissed off for…?

Chie Satonaka: You better not try any funny stuff while we’re asleep, is that clear?

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hey, we didn’t say you could-- Dammit, you owe us for this!

> You set up a barricade inside the tent using everyone’s belongings…

> You spent the night cramped up in a tight space…

> The next day…

> The students were all dismissed in the morning.

Yosuke Hanamura: Looks like we’re the only ones here! What’s wrong? Got a stomach ache?

Kanji Tatsumi: No, it’s just… I thought I got pissed and ran out of the tent last night… It’s so weird… Was it a dream? When I woke up, I was in Yosuke-senpai’s tent…

Chie Satonaka: It-It was a dream. Must’ve been a dream.

Kanji Tatsumi: Okay…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright, then let’s get swimming!

Kanji Tatsumi: Are you seriously taking a swim? I’ll pass… I’m still all stiff.

Chie Satonaka: What’re you looking at us for…? If you guys wanna swim, go right ahead.

Yosuke Hanamura: You know, you two still owe us.

Chie Satonaka: Huh? Whoa whoa whoa whoa, we’re not going in there. I mean, we do owe you, but… Oh yeah! We don’t have swimsuits with us! Man, of all the luck!

Yukiko Amagi: Y-Yeah, it really is unfortunate. Oh, I see how it is. We put up with your dinner, we save you from King Moron, and you won’t even have some fun with us in the river.

Chie Satonaka: N-No, it’s really too bad. It’d be no problem if I just had a swimsuit. Haha…

Yosuke Hanamura: Tadaaaa! I’ve got you covered! They’re Junes-brand originals, from our brand-new line of swimwear that just came in for the summer. I had a clerk friend of mine choose ’em for me. Pretty swanky, huh?

Chie Satonaka: Dude, that’s just wrong…

Yukiko Amagi: Did you have those this whole time…?

Yosuke Hanamura: C’mon, let’s all go swimming!

Chie Satonaka: What should we do, Yukiko…?

Yosuke Hanamura: ”It’d be no problem if I just had a swimsuit.”

Chie Satonaka: Urgh…

Yosuke Hanamura: Y’know, we really were looking forward to dinner.

Yukiko Amagi: Ngh…

Yosuke Hanamura: I wonder what would’ve happened if we didn’t help you guys last night…

Chie Satonaka: We get it already! Sheesh, you just never let things go!

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright! That’s more like it! How far off did those two go to get changed…?

Chie Satonaka: C’mon, let’s get in.

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa… Man…

Kanji Tatsumi: ……

Chie Satonaka: S-Stop staring like that!

Yukiko Amagi: H-Hey…

”You two look cute.”
”You look cute, Chie.” ✔
”You look cute, Yukiko.”
”……”

Chie Satonaka: Huh? Sheesh… What’s with you all of a sudden?

> Chie looks rather pleased…

Yosuke Hanamura: Man, this is going even better than I expected. Kinda makes up for having to eat that Mystery Food X last night. And c’mon, you guys gotta admit I chose some good suits. Those girls might be childish on the inside, but I bet they’re gonna turn into some fine-looking women before too long! Don’t you think so, Yu?

”You have a point there…” ✔
”I don’t know about that…”

Chie Satonaka: You guys crossed the line…

Yukiko Amagi: …Definitely.

[They push the guys into the river.]

> It’s cold…! The river’s like ice water…

Yosuke Hanamura: Agh! I-It’s freezing! Y-Y-You didn’t have to push us in…!

Chie Satonaka: Who cares!? You were going in the river anyway! They brought this on themselves. Sheesh… Aren’t they the worst, Kanji-kun? Hey, you’ve been awful quiet. Are you feeling okay? D-Don’t tell me the injuries from yesterday are still… Uhhhh…

Kanji Tatsumi: Wh-What…?

Yukiko Amagi: Ewww!

[She pushes him into the river. He’s not even undressed…]

Kanji Tatsumi: *gasp* Wh-What was that for!? I didn’t do anything!

Yukiko Amagi: That was close…

Kanji Tatsumi: *sneeze*

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hey! What’s gotten into you!?

Yukiko Amagi: Huh? Do you hear something over there?

> You hear a man heaving upstream…

> It seems that King Moron is vomiting further up the river…

Chie Satonaka: So that’s why no one else was here… Good thing we noticed before we went in.

Kanji Tatsumi: Senpai…

Yosuke Hanamura: Don’t say it…

> You feel as though a million showers will never make you clean…

CHAPTER 27: Shopping With the Bae
> You’re exhausted from the school camp… You should go back to your room and rest…

June 19th, 2011. Tuesday. Home.
> You have the day off from school today.

> You wonder when it’ll rain at night again.

> What should you do today?

[You go outside and meet Marie at Shopping District.]

Marie: Oh… You’re here. C’mon, let’s go somewhere. I want to go to the ”big city” this time. I heard there was a bunch of things to do there. So take me.

> The closest thing to a ”big city” near Inaba is Okina City…

> You decided to take Marie to Okina City…

> Okina City, in front of Okina Station…

> You brought Marie here by train to satisfy her curiosity…

Marie: So this is the ”city.” Hmmm… It’s a funny place. Wide, yet narrow. It’s grey and full of squares. Hey, what do you do in the city?

”Play around.”
”Peoplewatch.”
”There’s nothing to do.” ✔

Marie: There isn’t? Let’s go home, then. I’m sick of trains. Let’s take a plane.

> Marie is in anticipation…

Chie Satonaka: Huh, Yu-kun? …Oh, and Marie-chan!

Yukiko Amagi: Hello. Um… Is she your friend?

Chie Satonaka: Oh, that’s right. You haven’t met her before, huh? She’s Marie-chan. I had lunch with her once. Oh yeah, this is Yukiko Amagi! She’s our friend.

Marie: …Friend.

Yukiko Amagi: If she’s someone you know, then she must not be from around here, right? Did she come from the big city?

Chie Satonaka: Ah, I get it. So that’s why you’re here in Okina City, huh? There’s diddly-squat to do around where we live, right? Yeah, I know.

Marie: …And a black one today. What’re Green and Black doing here?

Yukiko Amagi: Green and… black?

Chie Satonaka: Ah… Haha… I was wearing green last time I saw you, wasn’t I…?

Yukiko Amagi: I don’t always wear black…!

Marie: I didn’t say it was bad. You look good in those colors.

Chie Satonaka: Oh, uh… Th-Thanks. …I didn’t think it was a compliment.

Yukiko Amagi: She’s a nice girl. There’s no doubt about that.

Marie: But Black Girl’s dressed so plain. Does Green Girl always wear the same thing all the time?

Chie Satonaka: To the point as ever…

Yukiko Amagi: …But she’s right.

Marie: No, that’s not what I meant. It’s just… It’s a waste. Humans can change their clothes, right? You should try wearing other colors.

Yukiko Amagi: I-Is that so…? I don’t really pick out my own outfits…

Chie Satonaka: I know! We were just on our way to get some new clothes. Why don’t you come with us, Yu-kun? You too, Marie-chan!

Yukiko Amagi: Chie, they might already have plans of their own. Don’t just assume they can come along at a moment’s notice.

”I don’t mind.” ✔
”If you want to.”

Marie: Huh…? I… don’t mind.

Chie Satonaka: All right, then! Let’s get going!

> Okina Station, Croco Fur…

> Chie and Yukiko are having fun while looking for clothes…

Chie Satonaka: Hey, how’s this shirt? Don’t you think it’s a good color?

> Chie is holding a green shirt…

”I don’t know.” ✔
”I think it’s good.”
”That’s green, you know.”

Marie: It’s green.

Chie Satonaka: Whoa, you’re right! Why do I keep buying myself green clothes!? Marie-chan, what’s your favorite color? Don’t tell me… blue, right?

Marie: Er, I don’t really have one…

Yukiko Amagi: What do you think of this skirt? Is it too mature for me?

> Yukiko has a jet-black skirt in her hands…

”I don’t know.” ✔
”I think it’s good.”
”That’s an eye-catching color.”

Marie: Why black again…?

Yukiko Amagi: I see. So, wearing a single color isn’t in? I like to keep things simple… Thank you. I’ll try exploring. Away with simplicity!

Marie: Oh… Well, okay.

Chie Satonaka: What about this? Does this say, ”me”?

Marie: …Green again?

Yukiko Amagi: How about this one? Away with simplicity!

Marie: There’s too many colors. I’m getting dizzy.

Chie Satonaka: This skirt’s cute! It would go well with… How’s this?

> Chie selects a yellow shirt and blue skirt…

Marie: At least it’s not green…

Yukiko Amagi: Wait… But, yellow and blue… make green, right?

Chie Satonaka: Oh. Ahahaha, you’re right. Maybe it’s some kind of instinct…?

Marie: You’re not doing it on purpose…?

> Chie and Yukiko finished their shopping and returned to the station with you…

Chie Satonaka: Why were they only out of stuff in my size…?

Yukiko Amagi: It can’t be helped. Let’s go back sometime later. They might have some new inventory by then.

Chie Satonaka: Why don’t we all go together, then? The four of us!

”Of course.” ✔
”If you want to.”

Marie: Huh…? Me, too? Why?

Chie Satonaka: Er, why? Because we’re friends?

Marie: …Friends? We are? Since when?

Chie Satonaka: Wait… didn’t you have fun!? W-Was I bothering you today? …And last time, too…?

Marie: Huh? No, you weren’t bothering me. I was just asking about why you said ”friends.” …What does it mean to become friends?

> Marie has questions…

Chie Satonaka: Well… I don’t really know. The meaning of friendship…? Hmmm…

”There’s meaning.” ✔
”You’ll know once you have one.”

Yukiko Amagi: Yes… I believe there is meaning. There are things you can’t do by yourself that you can do together with others. Like today. We had you to help us choose our clothes.

Marie: …I don’t get it. After all…

Chie Satonaka: I almost forgot! There’s a DVD I wanted! Let’s hurry! It’ll sell out!

Yukiko Amagi: It’s a kung fu movie, right? …I doubt it will sell out.

Chie Satonaka: Enough talk! Come on, everybody! Hustle!

Marie: Huh…? Me too?

”Let’s hurry.” ✔
”You’re not going?”
”It’ll sell out.”

Marie: I don’t get it. …It’s not like I don’t wanna go, though.

> Marie seems perplexed, but not against the idea…

Marie: Hey, those two are Persona-users, right? They’re ”chasing after the truth” with you, huh…? ……You can’t do that on your own, but you can do it together? Because you’re friends…?

> It seems Marie is wondering about what Yukiko said…

> You feel like you understand Marie a bit more now…

> The Marie Social Link has reached level 3!

> Your power to create Personas of the Aeon Arcana has grown!

Chie Satonaka: Hey! Pick it up, you two! Move, move, move!

> After looking around Okina City with everyone, you escort Marie back to the Velvet Room…

[Evening. Dojima’s house.]

> The three of you are sitting at the table.

> An entertainment news show is on…

Agency spokesman: That concludes Rise Kujikawa’s statement regarding her temporary leave of absence from the entertainment industry. We’re short on time, so if anyone has any remaining questions, we ask that you please keep them brief.

Magazine reporter: I’m Ishioka from Lady’s View. It says here that you’ll be recuperating--are you facing physical problems?

Rise Kujikawa: No, my health isn’t an issue--

Magazine reporter: Psychological problems, then?

Rise Kujikawa: Wha…?

Magazine reporter: Rumor has it you’ll be staying with your relatives, but isn’t that in Inaba where the murders have been taking place!?

Rise Kujikawa: Huh? Um…

Magazine reporter: Is it true that they run a traditional tofu shop? Will you be helping out with the family business!?

Agency spokesman: No more questions! This press conference is over! Clear the way, please!

> The press conference has erupted into chaos…

Nanako Dojima: Is Rise-chan quitting her job on TV?

Ryotaro Dojima: Who knows… But if this is her hometown, we’ll have to deal with everyone who’s trying to get a glimpse…

Rise Kujikawa: I’m tired of diets! Enough with going to the gym! Good thing there’s something even I can handle!

Commercial voice: Quelorie Magic is made for those worried about their calorie intake and body fat. It’ll slim you down in no time!

Ryotaro Dojima: Rise Kujikawa, huh…? The one good thing about this town was that it had nothing of note, and now we get all the buzz… What’s going on?

June 20th, 2011. Wednesday. Flood Plain.
Kanji Tatsumi: Yo, Senpai… *yaaawwn*. Oh, sorry. I haven’t completely woken up yet… Oh yeah, the shopping district seemed different today when I was passing by… Like, everyone was really hustlin’ more than usual… I wonder what’s going on.

”I smell a case behind it.” ✔
”It’s just your imagination.”

Kanji Tatsumi: ”Smell”…? Man, you are sounding like Teddie. It didn’t seem like the cops were involved in what was there, though. Guess I’ll try asking around at school…

[At school.]

Kanji Tatsumi: Yo.

Chie Satonaka: Hey, there he is. You’ve been coming to school pretty often lately. What’s up?

Kanji Tatsumi: It’s this annoying thing called the mandatory attendance policy.

Yosuke Hanamura: But man, seeing you here kinda reminds me of the school campout…

Kanji Tatsumi: I thought we were all gonna forget about what happened…

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh… Sorry.

Kanji Tatsumi: *sigh* Eh, whatever. So hey, you guys see the news?

Chie Satonaka: News…? Oh, that stuff about Rise Kujikawa taking a break from showbiz? I wonder why. She was just getting popular lately…

Yosuke Hanamura: Just goes to prove that being an idol is tough work.

”Is Rise that popular?” ✔
”Rise’s great.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh…? You don’t know her? Dude, what’s wrong with you? She’s all over the media! It hasn’t been that long since her debut, but at this rate, she’ll be a top-class idol in no time. To be honest, I’m a fan, too! She’s such a cutie pie!

Chie Satonaka: A cutie pie…? What are you, 80? But I think she used to live here, so she must have a lot of local fans.

Yukiko Amagi: The news said she’s going to her grandmother’s tofu shop, right? Do they mean Marukyu…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Marukyu?

Yukiko Amagi: Marukyu Tofu. Our inn was serving their tofu until recently.

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, that place in the shopping district! I pass by it all the time. Wait, does that mean I can meet Rise if I go to her tofu shop!?

”Can I meet her too?”
”I’m not interested.” ✔

Chie Satonaka: Hey, aren’t we getting a little sidetracked from the point here? Did you forget about the murders!? You’re the one who said the connection between the victims might be the TV! She could be the next target!

Yosuke Hanamura: C’mon, it’s not like Rise started showing up on TV just recently. Also, how could Rise be connected to the incidents so far?

Yukiko Amagi: I wondered the same thing, so I did some research. It seems that she had no personal interaction with Ms. Yamano. They’ve just been on the same show once or twice.

Chie Satonaka: She’s been an idol for a while now, but she’s the talk of the town thanks to the news last night. And she is moving here, after all.

Yosuke Hanamura: So, if our assumptions are correct, she fits the pattern… She’ll probably be targeted next. And if she is, that narrows down the killer’s methods even further.

Kanji Tatsumi: What’s that supposed to mean?

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* Kanji-kun, listen real carefully… If Rise is next, then that lets us rule out our theory that the targets have to be connected with the first case. And that means the killer’s targets are people who’ve been shown on TV recently. Get it now?

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh. Ohhh… Yeah, okay.

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright, now we have to keep a close eye on everything Rise does! Let’s do it!

Chie Satonaka: Sheesh, he’s all pumped up…

[Morning.]

Mrs. Nakayama: …All right, that’s the end of the proof and end of the chapter, too. So I’ve heard all the gossip and going around about Rise Kujikawa. Those idols don’t have ”normal people” problems. They’ll have money, they’ll never have to compromise in marriage… *sigh* What should I make for dinner tonight? But you know, June is bonus month! That’s why I’m a little bit happier right now. They say that Japan first implemented the bonus during the Meiji era. What a wonderful culture… Hey, are you listening to me!? I’m talking about a wonderful culture! Especially you, Narukami-kun! You’re looking bored! What period did Japan first implement bonus pay?

”Edo.”
”Meiji.” ✔
”Taisho.”

Mrs. Nakayama: Oh, so you were listening. That’s correct. Japan began issuing bonuses during the Meiji period. It’s a wonderful culture. It’s the joy in labor… So you’re all ignoring me thinking I’m just chit-chatting, eh? Well, now this is gonna be on the test.

[After classes.]

[In the hallway after class, you meet an arrogant girl…]

Ai Ebihara: Oh, it’s you… Hey, you wanna ditch class? Don’t worry, we’ll be back before the last bell.

> You accepted Ai’s invitation and decided to skip afternoon classes.

> Okina City, in front of Okina Station…

> Ai has dragged you here…

Ai Ebihara: Mmmm! Feels so good. Just knowing everyone else is still stuck at school studying makes it feel great to be out here.

”It’s okay once in a while.” ✔
”You shouldn’t ditch class.”

Ai Ebihara: You think so? I’m surprised you’re so open-minded. I had you pegged for a mama’s boy. It’s not like I do this all the time. Besides, since they started keeping track of my attendance and behavior record. I’ve been a good girl. Well, enough small talk. Let’s go. We’ll start with clothes, then we’ll hit jewelry and shoes, and maybe some cell phone stuff if there’s enough time.

> Ai only seems to be concerned about her own shopping…

”This is boring…” ✔
”All right, I’ll come.”

Ai Ebihara: Aren’t you happy just to have me around…? You’re weird. Anyway, time’s a’wasting.

[She begins to buy stuff. Later you find yourself caring two full bags.]

Ai Ebihara: It’s nice to have a personal servant! I can buy so much more this way.

> Ai paid for everything with a gold card…

”Got money to burn?” ✔
”…Whose card is that?”

Ai Ebihara: Well, I guess you could call my family ”new money.” We may not have status or history, but we do have money. My daddy made a fortune in land speculation. We’d better get going, though, or we won’t make it back before class ends. Soon as school gets out, I’m number one on the guidance counselor’s list. He has to check on my attendance and behavior, and sometimes, he tops it off with a lecture. It’s a major pain. But I’m out here having fun, and all the teachers are totally clueless. How stupid can they be? You know what, though? I had more fun today than usual. I think I’ll keep you around. But next time, let’s go after school.

> You have become acquaintances with the sports team manager, Ai Ebihara.

> You feel a faint bond forming between you and Ai…

> You have established the Ai Ebihara Social Link of the Moon Arcana!

> You may earn an EXP bonus when fusing Personas of the Moon Arcana!

Ai Ebihara: Are you coming!? Or maybe you’d like to be a blip on the guidance counselor’s radar yourself?

> You returned to school with Ai and snuck into your class…

[You noticed Yukiko standing in the school corridor.]

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, hi Yu-kun.

> It seems Yukiko isn’t busy right now…

> Since you have Sarasvati, a Persona of the Priestess Arcana, you feel you could be closer…

> Will you spend the afternoon with Yukiko?

> Junes grocery department…

> Yukiko brought you here…

Yukiko Amagi: I wrote down everything I need, so this shouldn’t take that long.

”What are you making?”
”Gotten any better yet?” ✔

> Yukiko is smiling sheepishly… 

Yukiko Amagi: I’m studying the basics of the basics. But it’s not turning out quite like it does in the book, even though I’m following the directions.

”Get someone to teach you.”
”Keep practicing.” ✔
”Want me to teach you?”

Yukiko Amagi: Yes. Practice makes perfect. I think there’s no point unless I do it alone…Our cooks help me out all the time. At first they just give me advice, but eventually they take the knife from me. So even if the meal turns out wonderfully, it doesn’t mean anything that way… I told them to leave me alone, but they still stay and watch. Are they that worried about my cooking…?

”You’re pretty bad.”
”If you started a fire…”
”They care about you.” ✔

Yukiko Amagi: They care about… me? Do… Do you really think so?

> Yukiko looks surprised, but happy…

Yukiko Amagi: Last time the head chef took the knife from me, shouting, ”I can’t stand to watch anymore!” and made the rest. The waitress saw it and said to the head cook, ”Yukiko wants to make it herself, even if it’s awful…” Before I knew it, I was ”studying how to cook for a boy I like”… My parents got involved and it exploded from there… *giggle* Funny, isn’t it? But… maybe it wasn’t all a lie. ……T-Taste my food again, okay…?

> Yukiko is blushing…

> You felt a faint hint of love from Yukiko…

> The Yukiko Amagi Social Link how to reach level 6!

> Your power to create Personas of the Priestess Arcana has grown!

> Yukiko’s growth of heart has affected her persona as well…

Yukiko Amagi: Ummm… Oh yeah, shopping!

> You helped Yukiko with her shopping and walked home partway together.

June 21st, 2011. Thursday. After school.
Yumi Ozawa: Oh, Yu-kun… Oh, right, it’s a practice day today… Are you going?

> Since you have Cu Sith, a Persona of the Sun Arcana you two might get along well…

> Will you spend the afternoon at drama club practice?

Yumi Ozawa: I see… You’re working hard, huh?

Yumi Ozawa: I’m sorry, but you should go to practice… by yourself. I have to go somewhere… I’ll drop by if I can make it.

> Yasogami High drama club…

> You participated in the acting exercises.

> You thoroughly practiced expressing a variety of emotions…

> Your Expression has increased.

> You expression has changed from Persuasive to Touching!

> Yumi isn’t here…

> The lead role of Yumi is supposed to play for the concours is being played in by the vice president…

> Did Yumi go to the hospital…?

> …You decided to visit in the hospital after practice ended.

> Inaba Municipal Hospital hallway…

> Yumi is sitting here, looking gloomy…

Yumi Ozawa: Yu-kun… Why are you…?

”I was worried about you.” ✔
”Just passing by.”
”I got hurt…”

Yumi Ozawa: Yu-kun…

> Yumi looks happier…

Yumi Ozawa: I’m sorry. You came because I didn’t show up to practice, right? … Mom collapsed. She works from sunup to sundown and then she comes here to look after him everyday… the doctor said it was exhaustion. She’ll be released from the hospital soon, but… She’s pushing yourself too far. She’s so stupid…

”It must’ve been tough.”
”Don’t say that about her.” ✔
”You should support her.”

Yumi Ozawa: My parents… Is that even the word for people like them? Nothing matters anymore. Now I have to look after Mom, like she should after him. If I don’t quit the drama club and get a job, Mom will just make herself sick again working all the time…! I’m stepping down from my role! The lead role… I had all my lines memorized! My script was full of notes! I’d practiced by myself all the time… But there’s no point now. Nothing goes my way… It’s all because of my parents. They’re both holding me back…

”It can’t be helped.”
”Stop acting like a child.”
”Take care of yourself, too.” ✔

Yumi Ozawa: …Thank you… You didn’t seem very reliable when we first met, but you know, you’re pretty kind after all.

> Yumi smiles and looks relieved.

Yumi Ozawa: …I’m sorry for complaining like this. It’s not like you have anything to do with what’s happening in my life.

”Yes, I do.” ✔
”That’s right, I don’t.”

Yumi Ozawa: In for a penny, in for a pound? Ha… It’s nice to hear you say that, though.

Yumi Ozawa: I’m going to visit my mom’s room now. …I’ll see you at school.

CHAPTER 28: Idol Tofu
[Evening.]

> It’s raining tonight.

> Will something appear on TV…?

> …A figure appeared!

> It seems to be a girl. She’s wearing a swimsuit…

> ……

> She looks somewhat like Rise Kujikawa, the idol you saw on TV yesterday…

> ……?

> For some reason it keeps zooming in on her chest and thighs…

> It’s hard to make out her face as a result…

[You phone’s ringing.]

> …It’s Yosuke.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hello!? Hey, did you see that!? That was Rise for sure! Rise Kujikawa!

”You’re right.” ✔
”I dunno…”

Yosuke Hanamura: Thought so! Oh… I guess I shouldn’t be so excited. There’s a chance she might get kidnapped… C’mon, we should go there tomorrow! What was it called again…? Oh yeah, Marukyu Tofu! Dude, my heart’s pounding already… Well, see you tomorrow!

> You’ll be going to Marukyu tofu shop with Yosuke tomorrow.

> ……

> You decide to go to bed for tonight.

June 22nd, 2011. Wednesday. After school.
Female student: Hey, did you hear? It looks like Rise Kujikawa really is here! You know the tofu store Marukyu? The owners of that place have the same last name: Kujikawa!

Male student: Seriously!? Hey, I practically live next door!

Yukiko Amagi: I’ve been hearing that there’s a big crowd at Marukyu.

Chie Satonaka: I’m not surprised. But was it really her on yesterday’s Midnight Channel? Didn’t she seem a little… different?

Yosuke Hanamura: It was her, no doubt about it!

Yosuke Hanamura: Her curves… Her posture… Even her beautiful, slim legs!

Chie Satonaka: …What’s that look for?

Yosuke Hanamura: Anyways, I’m positive! Right!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Uhh, are we going? I don’t really care about celebrities, but it’s not like I got anything better to do… Sure, I’ll tag along.

Chie Satonaka: Sorry, but me and Yukiko have plans. Give us a call if anything comes up.

Yosuke: Well, shall we get going? But let’s be clear on one thing: we’re not spectators. We’re on an investigation, got it?

> You decided to go to the Marukyu tofu shop.

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Um, Mr. Detective, did something happen?

Tohru Adachi: Oh, it’s you guys. Ai yi yi… These gawkers keep streaming in with their cars, trying to park in the middle of the shopping district.

Kanji Tatsumi: Why’s that?

Tohru Adachi: Don’t you know? Rise Kujikawa’s here. Hey, did you see her already? Is she there? Which is it?

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh…? We’re askin’ why a plainclothes detective is here doing traffic control.

Tohru Adachi: Oh… Uh, well… The Inaba Police Department isn’t that big, and we don’t have enough staff… Well, I still have work to do, so I’ll see you later.

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude… You managed to scare off a police detective on active duty…

Kanji Tatsumi: I wasn’t trying to scare the guy, I just said what I was thinking.

Yosuke Hanamura: But you’re right, it’s weird for the police to come out like this… Hey… You think the police suspect that Rise might be the next target, too?

Ryotaro Dojima: Alright, clear out. Coming through… Hey, Adachi! Dammit… I told him not to leave his post… What are you guys doing--Hm? Kanji Tatsumi…!? Are you friends with them?

Kanji Tatsumi: Like it’s any of your business…

Dojima: …If you say so. So I’ll ask again: What are you all doing here?

”We’re just passing by.” ✔
”We came to buy tofu.”
”We came to see Rise.”

Ryotaro Dojima: …Is that so?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, um… W-Well, who wouldn’t wanna come check it out if they found out an idol’s family ran an ordinary tofu store? I’m, uh… a big fan!

Ryotaro Dojima: …… *sigh* Fine. But remember. She might be a celebrity, but this is her home. Try not to bother them too much.

Kanji Tatsumi: That cop’s your uncle, eh…? So, what the hell was that about? Are you guys under suspicion…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, they did take us in once… We can’t just tell him everything, right? If we say anything about the other world, we only look more suspicious. They’ll be watching us all the time.

Kanji Tatsumi: Got a point there…

Young man’s voice: Man, there’s no one in there but the old lady. Risette isn’t here after all…

Older man’s voice: I heard that she really is already here, but it might’ve just been a rumor… Well, it was fun while it lasted.

Yosuke Hanamura: A rumor!? What, she’s not here!? Seriously!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Pfft, you sound like the world’s about to end.

Yosuke Hanamura: Shuddup! Anyways, now that all those people are gone, we might as well check inside. I’ll buy something.

Recommend silken tofu
Recommend momen tofu
Recommend ganmodoki ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: How’d you know I can’t eat tofu? Wow, that’s considerate of you.

> Yosuke seems somewhat happy…

Yosuke Hanamura: Wait, what’s ganmodoki again? Is it the kind with a rice cake in it?

Kanji Tatsumi: There’s no rice cakes in ’em… They’re sorta like… fried tofu patties with veggies and stuff mixed in, and…

> Yosuke received a crash course on ganmodoki…

Yosuke Hanamura: Ohhh, okay, I know what you mean! I think I can eat that. Let’s see here… Sure enough… The only one here is your typical old lady. *sigh*

Kanji Tatsumi: Man, why don’t you just ask if she’s in back? ’Scuse me!

Old lady: Yes, may I help you?

Yosuke Hanamura: What the--!? Then, who’s that…?

Kerchiefed girl: …What? ……?

Kanji Tatsumi: Uh… Are you Rise?

Kerchiefed girl: Yeah. So?

Yosuke Hanamura: No way… Are you really Risette?

Kerchiefed girl: What do you want?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh…? Oh, sorry, um… Some tofu, please!

Rise Kujikawa: Tofu…? Which kind?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Wh-Which one’s which again…?

Rise Kujikawa: If you’re going to eat it by itself, you should go with silken. Momen’s better for cooking… Depends how you use it.

Yosuke Hanamura: U-Um… Psst, Kanji! Order something!

Kanji Tatsumi: Wha--!? Why’re you making me do it!? You already picked ganmo a second ago! Dude here wants three ganmodoki.

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, I see… I’ll go get them.

Yosuke Hanamura: Wow… She’s nothing like she seems on TV… I wonder if she’s just tired… Man, but it’s really her… I’m so glad I came! Mission comple--Wait, we haven’t done what we came here for yet!

Yosuke Hanamura: Um…!

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Have you noticed anything weird lately?

Rise Kujikawa: Weird…? Like stalkers? Are you guys fans of mine?

Kanji Tatsumi: I wouldn’t say ”we,” but yeah, dude here’s a big fan.

Yosuke Hanamura: You little…! Why’d you let that slip!?

Kanji Tatsumi: ”Her curves, her posture, even her beautiful, slim legs”… Ya finished checkin’ em out yet, or what?

Yosuke Hanamura: Waaaaaaah! Y-You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you!? I didn’t say that! I never said any of that! Maybe you know already, but it’s been dangerous in Inaba lately. That’s why we’ve been investigating some stuff.

Rise Kujikawa: Oh yeah?

Yosuke Hanamura: Sorry, um… Let’s see… Do you know about the TV show that comes on at midnight? I mean, it’s not like regularly scheduled programming… How do I explain this…?

Rise Kujikawa: …That thing that was on last night? The Midnight Channel, yeah?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, you know about it… Wait… What!? You mean you saw it last night!?

Rise Kujikawa: I heard the rumors from some friends of mine. But that girl last night wasn’t me. I’ve never been filmed wearing that swimsuit before. And the bustline…

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh?

Rise Kujikawa: Mine aren’t that big.

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh yeah, I see what you mean now… I-I mean… What am I saying!? U-Um, I’m sorry…!

Rise Kujikawa: …Don’t apologize so much. You’re funny.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, she smiled.

Rise Kujikawa: What is that show about, anyway?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, we’re not too sure either… But you know there’s been stuff happening here, right? We think the people who appear there… are the ones who get kidnapped next.

Kanji Tatsumi: I know this is sudden, but we’re not lying.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, that’s why we thought you should know about it.

Rise Kujikawa: Huh… So that wasn’t a dream. I was tired yesterday, but I couldn’t sleep. And it was raining, so I decided to try that rumor I’d heard about… Hmm. Alright, thanks… I’ll be careful. Here you go, three ganmo. That’ll be 600 yen. There’s extra tofu in there for everyone… A little thank-you for worrying about me.

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa, seriously? Thanks!

Kanji Tatsumi: Yosuke-senpai, you can’t eat tofu, right? Want me to take yours?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hell no! I always eat what people give me.

> Rise gave you a block of tofu.

> Maybe you can eat it for dinner…

Rise Kujikawa: Thank you very much. Your receipt’s in the bag.

Tohru Adachi: Seems like the crowds are thinning out, so we’ll be leaving now. If it gets rowdy again, just give us a call at the station.

Rise Kujikawa: Okay.

Ryotaro Dojima: Uh, hang on a second. Sorry, but there’s some things I’d like to ask you. You do know that there have been multiple violent cases around here lately, yeah? Have you seen anyone suspicious around?

Rise Kujikawa: Not really… It’s been like always.

Ryotaro Dojima: Like always… Well, you’re an idol, so I imagine you deal with folks like fans, paparazzi, and stalkers quite often. What made you take a break from showbiz?

Rise Kujikawa: Does it really matter?…I just needed a rest.

Ryotaro Dojima: And have you registered for school?

Rise Kujikawa: I’m planning on going to Yasogami High. It was the closest.

Ryotaro Dojima: I don’t mean to alarm you, but… You do have some things in common with the recent victims. That’s why, well…

Rise Kujikawa: I might be kidnapped, right? I’ve been told that before. Don’t worry, I’ll be careful.

Tohru Adachi: Huh…? Someone told you already?

Rise Kujikawa: It was three guys… They were wearing uniforms, so I think they were high school students…

Ryotaro Dojima: Did one of them happen to look… How do I put it… Did he look something like a gang member?

Tohru Adachi: Wait… You think she’s talking about your nephew and his friends?

Ryotaro Dojima: ……Something smells here. The recent disappearances… Between those and the two homicides, there’s too many questions with no answers. To tell the truth, I followed my detective’s intuition and came here to warn her. How could high school kids who know less than we do beat us to the punch…? Were they just making up an excuse to talk to a famous celebrity…? Or…

Tohru Adachi: Sir…?

Ryotaro Dojima: Yasogami High… The second victim, Saki Konishi, and two other students who were missing for a while…

Tohru Adachi: I guess the investigation of the ones involved with the school hasn’t turned up anything either… Aren’t we gonna be in trouble if this keeps up? The prefectural police will be coming soon to--

Ryotaro Dojima: They’re the least of your worries! Keep your head in the game.

> Later that day…

Nanako Dojima: We sure have a lot of tofu.

Ryotaro Dojima: Yeah… It tastes great. visited Rise Kujikawa today. What did you talk about?

”Nothing, really…”
”Just gossip.” ✔
”About the cases.”

Ryotaro Dojima: …I see. *sigh* Forget it… I shouldn’t have brought it up.

Nanako Dojima: You guys met Rise-chan!?

Ryotaro Dojima: *sigh* Yeah…

Nanako Dojima: Are you… fighting again?

Ryotaro Dojima: Of course not… Here, hurry and finish your dinner.

> The tense atmosphere continues into the night…

> It’s raining tonight.

> Will something appear on TV…?

> …A figure appeared!

> It’s the same girl as before, still wearing a swimsuit. Her chest area and waist are emphasized…

> This girl…

> It’s Rise Kujikawa! The image is fairly clear tonight.

> Should you try calling Yosuke…?

Call Yosuke ✔
Wait until tomorrow

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey! We were right about it being Rise Kujikawa! The one on tonight seemed a lot creepier than the real Rise, but you could see her face clearly. There’s no mistake. Let’s all get together as soon as possible tomorrow!

> You hung up.

> You should talk to the others about this tomorrow, as soon as possible.

> You decide to go to bed for tonight.

June 23rd, 2011. Thursday.
[After school, June’s food court.]

Yosuke Hanamura: So, about the Midnight Channel last night… That had to be Rise Kujikawa. It even showed her face this time.

Yukiko Amagi: So now we know one more thing. The ones that the culprit’s targeting are…

”Connected to Ms. Yamano.”
”Broadcasted on TV.” ✔
”Females from Inaba.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Exactly! So we can rule out the assumption that all the victims are connected to the incident with Ms. Yamano. As for Rise, I took a peek this morning, and she was still at the shop. So I’m guessing that ”TV show” thing doesn’t appear on the Midnight Channel until after the person enters the TV.

Yukiko Amagi: Teddie said before that it might be the victim’s own creation upon entering that world. I didn’t understand at all at first, but now I feel it may be true. The one that appears on TV is your other self… Maybe the victim’s true feelings are shown unconsciously.

Chie Satonaka: But… We see them on the Midnight Channel before they disappear. You know, when it’s still really fuzzy and you can’t tell who it is. How do you explain that part?

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah… It always happens before the person disappears, like an advance notice…

Chie Satonaka: Or like a ransom note. But who are they announcing it to? And for what?

Yosuke Hanamura: I dunno, ask the killer. There’s a bunch of stuff I still don’t understand.

Yukiko Amagi: Is it possible that we see those images for the same reason?

Chie Satonaka: Huh? What do you mean?

Yukiko Amagi: If the Midnight Channel shows the victim’s true feelings… maybe it does the same for the culprit. Maybe what we’re seeing is the culprit’s intentions.

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, it’s a possibility… The killer can throw people into the TV, after all, which means they must have the same power that we do.

Chie Satonaka: So… When the killer thinks, ”I’m gonna attack someone now,” that’s what we see on TV?

Yukiko Amagi: I don’t know about that…

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, if we’re gonna go that far with it, we might as well say that’s the basis for that entire world. Like, it’s some kinda mix of the minds of the victims and the killer… Or maybe it’s everyone’s minds?

”I think so too.”
”That’s kinda far-fetched.”
”I don’t know…” ✔

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* As always, nothing makes sense. Hey Kanji-kun, you still with us? You haven’t said a word yet.

Kanji Tatsumi: Whaa…? Uhh… Well, um…

Chie Satonaka: You weren’t sleeping, were you…?

Kanji Tatsumi: O-Of course not! I was uh, lost in thought.

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* I wish I knew what that world’s all about. Teddie’s explanations have so many ”maybe”s in them that I don’t understand the first thing about it.

Yukiko Amagi: Why would the culprit throw people inside the TV in the first place?

Yosuke Hanamura: They must know by now that people die when they’re in there long enough… There’s no doubt it’s attempted murder. So the TV’s a good way to do that, because the police can never prove anything about the crime.

Kanji Tatsumi: Murder, huh…? So the killer’s got a grudge against certain people? Well, I know there’s a shitload of people who’ve got my number. How ’bout you, Yukiko-senpai? Anyone hate you so bad they’d get rid of you forever?

Yukiko Amagi: No.

Chie Satonaka: Uh, Yukiko… There’s always a slight chance and you just don’t realize it… Haha. But if we’re trying to think of a common grudge someone would have against all the victims… I’m drawing a blank.

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, the good thing is, we have another shot at getting ahead of the killer. We can leave the motive aside for now. Once we catch ’em, we’ll make ’em talk. The only thing we can be sure of now is that Rise is in danger.

Chie Satonaka: Wait… We get to do another stakeout!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hell yeah! This time we’ll catch ’em in the act!

[Food store.]

Chie Satonaka: We gotta go with donuts and milk.

Yosuke Hanamura: You said it. There’s no better meal than that for a man on a stakeout. Oh, and throw in some disposable diapers.

Chie Satonaka: For what!? They don’t even sell those here!

Yosuke Hanamura: We have ’em at Junes.

Chie Satonaka: Too much information!

Kanji Tatsumi: You guys finished yet? Let’s hurry up and get going.

[The gang pays for their purchases. Adachi enters.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? What brings you here?

Tohru Adachi: Oh, uh… Well… I’m doing legwork. Ugh, what did I do to deserve babysitting detail…? I-I mean, it’s nothing major. It’s not like Dojima-san ordered me here. So what are you kids up to? Buying snacks?

Yosuke Hanamura: We were just about to head over to the tofu shop to see Rise-chan.

Tohru Adachi: Oh… I see. H-Heyyy! I’m on my way there too!

Chie Satonaka: Oh, then why don’t we go there together? C’mon, he’s a detective on active duty. Not a bad guy to have around!

[Tofu shop at Shopping District.]

> Rise is tending the shop…

Yosuke Hanamura: Don’t stop! The culprit might get suspicious!

Kanji Tatsumi: But we’ve walked past here like a thousand times already…

Tohru Adachi: Come on out, you bastard…! We’re ready for you…

Yukiko Amagi: Oh… Look!

Tohru Adachi: Wh-Who’s there!?

[Some guy climbed an electricity pole near the shop. He jumps off and runs away.]

Chie Satonaka: Hey, he’s running away!

Kanji Tatsumi: Get back here! Stop running, dammit!

Suspicious man: D-Don’t come near me!

Kanji Tatsumi: Shaddup! What kinda idiot would listen to--

Suspicious man: I-I’ll do it, you know! What’re you gonna do if I get run over!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What…!?

Tohru Adachi: N-No! If the suspect gets injured, the police will be held responsible… They’ll get really angry, and… …Um.

Suspicious man: I’ll do it, I swear! S-So get outta here and stop chasing me!

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hey, what should we do?

”Tackle him from the front.”
”Tackle him from behind.” ✔
”Let Yosuke decide.”

Yosuke Hanamura: How are we supposed to get behind him…?

Kanji Tatsumi: C’mon… let’s just take him down.

Yosuke Hanamura: All right, on my mark… Don’t pass the buck, man!

Kanji Tatsumi: C’mon… let’s just take him down.

Yosuke Hanamura: All right, on my mark…

Yosuke Hanamura: Look! Over there! A Martian!

[They beat the guy up.]

Suspicious man: Ack! H-How dare you assault an ordinary citizen like--

Kanji Tatsumi: Shut the hell up, murderer! We’re taking your punk ass in!

Suspicious man: Wha--!? Time out! What do you mean, ”murderer”!?

Chie Satonaka: It’s no use playing dumb!

Suspicious man: W-Wait a second! I just really like Risette, so I wanted to take a peek in her room… Look, see! All I’ve got on me is a bunch of cameras!

Tohru Adachi: Yep, you’re the culprit, all right. No two ways about it. All right, I’ll take it from here. We’ll hear your story down at the station… Ohh, how I’ve waited to use that line!

Suspicious man: P-Please! Let me go! I didn’t do anything wrong! I-I know for a fact it’s not a crime in this country to take secret pictures!

Tohru Adachi: Hey, don’t you understand what’s happening here? You’re under suspicion of murder! Come with me! We’ll talk about this later! Wow, that went better than I thought! What a coup! I gotta thank you guys for all your help! Well done!

[He handcuffed the pervert.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh… sure!

Tohru Adachi: But you really should stop getting involved with this stuff. It’s dangerous. I know Dojima-san was worried sick. (to the guy) C’mon, let’s go!

Yosuke Hanamura: Is it… really over?

Kanji Tatsumi: Rest is up to the cops…

Chie Satonaka: Looks like the killer was a pervert, just like we thought. Wait… Does that mean the case is closed? Seriously!? Awesome!

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, we should let Rise know the good news!

Rise’s grandmother: Oh, hello. Would you like some tofu?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, h-hello. Umm…

Rise’s grandmother: Oh, did you come to see Rise? She seems to have gone out, unfortunately…

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? But wasn’t she just here?

Rise’s grandmother: She does that sometimes. She’ll just wander out without a word… You must forgive her. She’s quite worn out, in many ways.

Yosuke Hanamura: She left… without saying anything?

Tohru Adachi: C’mon, you worry too much! She must’ve just stepped out. I mean, we caught the guy.

Suspicious man: Wh-What are you talking about…?

Tohru Adachi: We’ll discuss it later. If you’ll excuse me, I’ve gotta take this guy in for questioning. Man, I can’t wait to see the look on Dojima-san’s face!

Yukiko Amagi: She left without saying anything…? Could that mean…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Shouldn’t we look for her!? She can’t have gone far.

Chie Satonaka: Y-Yeah, I agree! I can’t find her anywhere. What about you guys?

Yukiko Amagi: None of the neighbors have seen her…

Chie Satonaka: Maybe we’re just not looking in the right places… But where could she have gone?

Yosuke Hanamura: Dammit, this can’t be good. I hope I’m wrong…

Kanji Tatsumi: Well, we did everything we can. No use griping about it. The weatherman says it’s gonna rain tonight, so let’s just keep our fingers crossed and tune in.

> You should make certain to watch the Midnight Channel tonight…

CHAPTER 29: Marukyu Striptease
[Evening.]

> It’s raining tonight…

> Something may appear on TV…

> …Someone appeared!

> It’s an extremely vivid image!

Girl on screen: ”Maru-Q! Push Risette!” Good evening, good evening! I’m Rise Kujikawa! This spring, one young girl levels up to become a high school idol… Yayyyy! So today, I’m gonna celebrate by pushing the limits of Standards & Practices! Does everybody know what time it is? Showtime! Show what, huh? Hmhmhm… E-very-thing! Eee, how embarrassing! Is this too hot for TV!? Well, if a thing is worth doing, it’s worth doing all the way! I’m gonna bare it all for you! Heehee! Stay tuned!

> It was definitely Rise you saw…

[Your phone’s ringing.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, d-did you see Risette on TV!? I-Is she serious about baring it all!? Is it me, or are these shows getting crazier and crazier!?

> Yosuke sounds excited.

”Calm down.” ✔
”Let’s rescue her quick.”
”We’re in no rush.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-You’re right. I’m starting to get the hang of this… Her Shadow self is probably doing whatever it wants again. But man… We couldn’t prevent the kidnapping this time either… even when we knew who the target would be. That detective from this afternoon was no help at all. I guess we’ll have to do everything ourselves… A-Anyways, see you tomorrow!

> …You decide to go to bed early.

June 24th, 2011. Friday, TV World.
Chie Satonaka: Heeeey, Teddie, you okay?

Teddie: I wasn’t crying. Everyone was having fun out there. You forgot about me… I was abandoned.

Chie Satonaka: W-We would never do that!

Yukiko Amagi: I’m sorry… Were you lonely?

Teddie: I was bored. It made me all listless. I’m a useless bear. I don’t even know what I am. I couldn’t figure it out… No one would come visit me… Then I thought I heard voices from your world. They were all having so much fun… I was so lonely that I tried to cry. But I couldn’t…

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, you are hollow inside…

Teddie: Shut up! Stop saying I’m hollow!

Yosuke Hanamura: Don’t snap at me! This is your world, isn’t it!? You’re the one who said you just want to live here peacefully, and made us promise to find the culprit!

Chie Satonaka: C’mon, I’m sure Teddie’s just tired from thinking so much, right?

Teddie: When I’m alone, I think too much. It makes me even lonelier. I was so sad that my chest would burst and cotton would fly out… Can I try scoring with you two someday?

Chie Satonaka: Sure, go right ahead!

Yukiko Amagi: Can we please drop the whole ”scoring” thing…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Anyways, we wanted to ask you something! How’s it been over here? Did a girl called Rise Kujikawa show up? Can you sense anything?

Teddie: Rise Kujikawa? Hm…?

Yosuke Hanamura: You can’t tell…? Your nose is kinda losing its edge lately, huh?

Teddie: I’m a pretty shabby bear… Soon, I won’t be useful at all. Then I’ll get thrown away…

”That’s not true.”
”Maybe.” ✔
”Try harder.”

Teddie: I-I’ll… find something I can do…

Chie Satonaka: Okay. Then we’ll go look for something that’ll help you search, like last time.

Teddie: I can’t tell for sure. But I can kinda sense someone in here… I think I’ll be able to find her. I just need some kind of hint.

> In order to make any progress, it seems you’ll need more information about Rise.

> You should try asking around town…

Teddie: There’s a lot of things I don’t understand…

”No need to rush it.”
”We’ll figure it out.”
”I’ve got your back.” ✔

Teddie: Thank you beary much. You’re really kind, Sensei… I’ll try even harder from now on.

> Teddie is doing his best to try and find his role in life…

> You feel a faint bond forming between you and Teddie…

> You have established the Teddie Social Link of the Star Arcana!

Teddie: I’ll be waiting here…

[You start asking around the school about Risette…]

Risette fan: Risette? I’m her biggest fan! I’m like, diehard Risette! You are too? We… no? Well, ask me anything you want to know! A real Risette fan like me should be able to give you the minutest details. …Oh, you just want like, a status update? Well, nothing’s been bigger than the bomb she dropped about taking time off for a little R&R. Her blog may have some hints about why, but… well, there are a lot of theories out there. As a fan, I am devastated. But I guess there’s not much I can do about it… If you want more up-to-the-minute info, shouldn’t you be asking someone in the media of something? Maybe I’ll send a letter through her fan club… Hmph, I wonder if those’ll ever reach her now…

> It seems like Rise has a lot on her mind…

> Perhaps you should ask around…

[You go to the Shopping District.]

Rise’s grandmother: Oh, you’re the boy from the other day. Looking for Rise? Sometimes she leaves the house without telling me… I hope she’s okay… I’ve heard that some person with a camera has been wandering around recently. I think that person was called ”papa rat” or something… The people in this district try their best to get rid of that person but he just keeps coming back… I hear that he’s often at the flood plain.

> There seems to be a paparazzo who’s been snooping on Rise.

> Samegawa Flood Plain

Kind man: The paparazzi… I don’t know much about them, but I see cameraman and the like around here sometimes. They’re obviously from out of town, so they caught my eye. But now that you mention it, I haven’t seen any today.

> It seems that they come here fairly often… Maybe you should get them tomorrow…

[Back to the school.]

Saki Konishi’s brother: Oh… Yu-san. Is there something you want?

> You recall that you borrowed a handkerchief from him.

> Will you return the handkerchief and talk with him?

Resume the handkerchief ✔
Cancel

Saki Konishi’s brother: Oh, this is… You could’ve just thrown that away… This was my sister’s handkerchief. My mom put it in my bag by mistake… No one ever uses it anymore, so… I’m sure the handkerchief is glad to have been able to fulfill its duty. …Thanks.

> He expressed his gratitude…

”No, thank you.”
”Thanks for what…?”
”It was a big help.” ✔

Saki Konishi’s brother: No… I-It’s okay, really… Oh, I’m Naoki Konishi. Um, I apologize for saying I hated you when I first met you.

”I didn’t mind.”
”You’re usually more polite.” ✔
”I was hurt.”

Saki Konishi’s brother: I always say one word too many…

> Naoki shrugs.

> You have become acquaintances with Saki Konishi’s younger brother, Naoki Konishi.

> Naoki is struggling to cope with his complicated situation…

> You feel a faint bond forming between you and Naoki…

> You have established the Saki Konishi’s Brother Social Link of the Hanged Man Arcana!

Naoki Konishi: Last time, when I came to that meeting, I made everyone feel uneasy, right? After that, I was officially ”fired” from the Association. They told me not to come to meetings anymore. Well oh, it’s my own fault… Left behind again. If it’s okay with you, maybe we can have fun together. I’m usually by our liquor store at the beginning of the week. I’m helping out there… Well… I’ll be going.

> You parted ways with Naoki and went home.

[Evening.]

Nanako Dojima: Oh, you’re home. It’s going to rain soon. The TV said so. …Yes?

> Nanako looks as if she’s not doing anything…

> You feel your relationship with Nanako is going to be closer soon…

> Will you spend the evening with Nanako?

Nanako Dojima: Okay. Yay!

> Nanako looks happy.

> You decided to watch TV with Nanako.

> It’s a documentary about a young man searching for his real father…

> ……

> Nanako is staring into the TV.

Nanako Dojima: Real… father… What do they mean by ”real”?

”Related to you by blood.”
”A person you love a lot.”
”Always by your side.” ✔

Nanako Dojima: I see… Then you’re my real big brother. Because you’re always home everyday…

> Nanako looks happy…

Nanako Dojima: But Dad… Maybe… Maybe I’m not ”real” to him? Daddy doesn’t come home because I’m not his ”real” daughter?

”Did he say that?” ✔
”That’s not true.”
”You have me.”

Nanako Dojima: …No.

> It looks like Nanaki has stopped worrying…

Nanako Dojima: Mom… Why’d you leave me? …When Mom was still here, we all went out together… we picked flowers at Samegawa…

> Nanako talked some about her memories…

> You understood Nanako’s true feelings a little better.

> The Nanako Dojima Social Link has reached level 5!

Nanako Dojima: Hey… Big bro…

> It’s about Nanako’s bedtime…

> What should you do…?

Talk with her ✔
Put her to bed
Listen to her talk

Nanako Dojima: Okay! Umm, well, today, I woke up…

> Nanako looks like she is having fun telling you about her day.

> It’s getting late, so you put Nanako to bed and went to your own room.

June 25th, 2011. Saturday. After school.
> Classes have ended for today.

> The fog will come after several days of rain… You must prepare to take action.

> But first, you need to gather information for Teddie…

> The Flood Plain

Photographer: How’s it going? …Oh, you came to ask about Rise Kujikawa? You’re looking for information about Rise, too? …Well, how about this? Why don’t we exchange information? You tell me what you know, I’ll tell you what I know. The people in the shopping district are making it hard for me to do any information gathering.

Trade information ✔
Refuse the offer

> You decide to give him some information about Rise…

”She’s different on TV.”
”I think she’s stressed.” ✔
”I think she’s in this town.”

Photographer: So she’s worried about something, huh? Maybe it had something to do with… No, actually, she’s probably just worried about the TV coverage regarding the stocking hiatus. I’d heard that ”Risette” was getting tired of her made-up personality. ”The real me and the different me who has to act like an idol…” SHE couldn’t stand living two lives anymore… or something like that. Well, you didn’t give me anything new, but thanks for the information. I can at least turn this into something…

> He seemed to know some other things about Rise. Maybe you should inquire further.

”She’s different on TV.” ✔
”I think she’s stressed.”
”I think she’s in this town.”

Photographer: Hmm, as I thought. …To be honest, I used to do a little digging into Risette’s private life. I was surprised to discover she’s totally different from than on TV. You’d never recognized her in real life. Though, when you think of an idol you should honestly just assume ”manufactured personality,” too.

> If you put together the information they paparazzi give you…

> It seems that Jennifer was acting as a ”manufactured personality.”

> And she was worrying about her ”real self” and her ”idol self.”

> She was truly worrying about her true self.

> You seem to have gained some insight regarding Rise…

> You should report to Teddie.

> Gather everyone at the food court?

Kanji Tatsumi: Well, everyone’s here. All right! Time to get fired up!

[They enter the TV world!]

Teddie: Hey, Sensei! You look like you found some clues! Did you find out more about this girl Rise-chan? Hmhm… Her real self… I see… She’s just like me. The delicate, sentimental type. Then… Hrmmm… Whaah!? There’s something out there! Is this it? Did I find her!? Follow me!

[The heroes go with Teddie.]

Chie Satonaka: What is this place…? It’s all dark… Whoa… Is this a…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, like the kind you always find in resort towns!?

Yukiko Amagi: Ah, I think you’re right. ……Oh! B-But we don’t have one… Our inn is not like that…!

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh. So this is a strip joint, eh?

Teddie: Strip!? Aha! I know what that is! It’s the thing zebras have, right!?

Chie Satonaka: ……

Teddie: Strip… Like a zebra, right!? Right!?

Yukiko Amagi: It’s so bright here… Even with the glasses on, my eyes hurt.

Teddie: Doesn’t anyone get the joke!? Okay, let’s try one more time… Strip… It’s something zebras have…

Chie Satonaka: Can anyone shut this thing up!?

Yukiko Amagi: Huh? Zebra…? Sorry, what’re we talking about?

Teddie: I-I won’t say it again… Let’s hurry on…

> You have pinpointed Rise’s location. All that’s left is to rescue her.

> You should prepare well to make sure the rescue operation goes smoothly…

Teddie: Our team is filling out now that Yuki-chan and Kanji are on board!

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, there were just a couple of us to start out with.

Chie Satonaka: Alright, let’s get fired up!

[Having assembled the team, the heroes set off to explore this strange show…]

Teddie: Hmmm… This smell, this atmosphere… It’s making my heart pound!

CHAPTER 30: The Real Me
[After some time of battles and wanderings along the corridors…]

Teddie: The smell’s coming from here!

> Open the curtain and enter?

Yes ✔
No

Yosuke Hanamura: It’s Rise!

Chie Satonaka: But something’s not right…

Yukiko Amagi: It must be her other self…

Rise Kujikawa: Hello, all you fans out there! Thanks for coming today! Today, you’re gonna see every last inch of me! What’s that? You don’t believe me? Ahahah! Okay, okay! Then why don’t we--Oh, but you won’t be able to see with all this smoke, huh? Okie-dokie! Just follow me a little further in and I’ll prove that I’m every bit as good as my word!

Kanji Tatsumi: W-Were we like that…? That’s… going kinda far…

Chie Satonaka: Sheesh, the roar of the crowd is insane this time… It’s making me feel sick.

Yosuke Hanamura: If people really are watching this… we gotta do something, and fast.

Rise Kujikawa: All right, Risetteers! Don’t touch that dial! When we come back, you’ll get a good, long look at the real me! Maru-Q!

Yosuke Hanamura: W-We’d better move it! This is a thousand times worse than just hearing a few nasty secrets!

Teddie: The Shadows are really getting aggravated! What we just saw is what that Rise girl is suppressing! She’ll be in trouble at this rate!

Kanji Tatsumi: So, guess I’m on the rescue team now. Alright, let’s hurry up and go!

CHAPTER 31: The Amorous Snake
[The search continues…]

Rise’s voice: C’mon, hang in there! Just a little more to go! I’m rooting for you!

Teddie: Whaa…? We’re desperately trying to save her, but she’s cheering us on instead…? I don’t know how to feel about this…

Rise’s voice: Wow! I’m so happy you came! But still, I’m a little embarrassed… So I’m going to turn out the lights!

Teddie: Hrm!? if she turned off the lights, then that means… *gulp* S-Sensei! Am I able to climb the stairway to adulthood!?

> You can hear voices from beyond the curtain…

Rise’s voice: You came! Okay, I’m ready for anything…

Teddie: *gulp* …Are you ready, Sensei?

> Open the curtain and enter?

Rise Kujikawa: It’s my first time… Please be gentle. I’m turning on the lights, okay?

[She turns into a snake with a cross on its neck.]

Teddie: Whooooooa!?

[The heroes defeat the snake.]

Teddie: What is this immense feeling of… disappointment? I didn’t even get a chance to choose! Have I been fooled?

Rise’s voice: Good evening! It’s me, Rise Kujikawa! Why don’t I tell all your friends a little about myself?

Teddie: What’s this? What’s she up to?

Rise’s voice: Hmmm… What should I talk about first…? Ummm… Never mind. Maybe some other time.

Teddie: L… LAAAAME!

[On the next floor…]

Rise’s voice: Let’s see… My work right now… Yeah, I think it’s really fulfilling. I longed to be an idol ever since I was a kid. Every day’s so much fun!

Teddie: It’s really fulfilling for me too, since I’m with you guys, Sensei! Thank you, Sensei!

[On the next floor…]

Rise’s voice: My ideal guy…? Hmmm… I guess someone that’s kind and clean? Oh, looks don’t matter that much. I actually don’t really like handsome- looking guys. I mean, it’s what’s on the inside that really counts, right?

Teddie: I see… So one’s insides are important… But I’m all empty…

CHAPTER 32: Shadow Rise
[After a long and tiresome wander through the consciousness of Rise, the heroes find the door behind which the owner of this show is waiting for them…]

Teddie: ……I think that girl named Rise is ahead of here… But I’m not certain.

> Raise the curtain and enter?

Yes ✔
No

Chie Satonaka: There it is!

Yosuke Hanamura: Look, the real one’s here too!

Shadow Rise: Aaahahahahaha! They’re all watching! All eyes are on me now!

Rise Kujikawa: Stop it!

Shadow Rise: Awwww! What’s the matter? You wanna show your stuff, don’tcha? How’s this!?

[She start dancing on a pole.]

Rise Kujikawa: Please… stop this…

Shadow Rise: *chuckle* Oooh, she wants me to stop. That’s so funny! As if that’s even close to what you’re really thinking, you little skank! You’re me! And obviously, I’m you!

Rise Kujikawa: No… That’s not true…

Shadow Rise: Ahahahahah! C’mon, look! You can’t tear your eyes away! This is me! This is who I really am! Not Risette, the fake celebrity! Look at the girl right in front of you! I’m sick of being some airhead cliche who chokes down everything she’s fed and takes it all with a smile! ”Risette”? Who the hell is she? There’s no such person in this world! I’m no one but myself! C’mon, look at me!

Rise Kujikawa: That’s not-- I…!

Shadow Rise: Well then, I guess it’s time to prove it. I’m gonna show it all off! Let my naked truth be burned into your brains!

Rise Kujikawa: Stop… Stop it! You’re…

Chie Satonaka: No! Don’t say it!

Rise Kujikawa: You’re… not me!

Shadow Rise: *chuckle* Heehee, ahaha! Aaahahahahaha! Here it comes! Now, I’m finally myself!

Kanji Tatsumi: Tch… Here we go!

[She turns into a giant abstract figure dancing on a pole.]

Shadow Rise: I am a shadow… The true self… And now, the moment you’ve been waiting for! It’s time for me to show you every last inch of myself! Heehee… And for our guests in the front row… I’ll give you extra-special, extra- intense service!

Yosuke Hanamura: Looks like she had issues of her own after all… But we’ll stop her from going berserk!

Kanji Tatsumi: So I was like this too…? Oh man…

Shadow Rise: Ohhh? You’re going to rush the stage? What an ill-mannered guest… Maybe you’re looking for an experience that’s a little more intense!?

[Heroes plunges into battle with Shadow Rise.]

Shadow Rise: Ahahaha! Enjoying yourself? I’ve got a ways to go until I show my true self… You ain’t seen nothin’ yet!

[The fight continues…]

Shadow Rise: What…? I dealt all that exquisite pain and you’re still not satisfied? What a finicky guest… You might as well die, then! Ngh… How!? Die, you bastards! Die! No touching allowed. Ahaha! I can see everything about you… Ahaha!

[Finally Shadow Rise had enough.]

Chie Satonaka: What’s the deal!? Our attacks aren’t making a dent!

Yosuke Hanamura: Damn, it’s like it’s anticipating our every move…

Teddie: I-I’m completely useless…

Yosuke Hanamura: What the--!?

Teddie: That power… I think it’s scanning us! Ohh, this is not good!

Kanji Tatsumi: When you say ”not good,” what exactly does that mean!?

Shadow Rise: Woohoo…! Analysis complete! Okay, here comes my counterattack! See if you can dodge, hmm?

Teddie: S-Stop it!

[Shadow Rise attacks the heroes and they, exhausted, fall to the floor.]

Yosuke Hanamura: You gotta be kidding…

Chie Satonaka: How’re we supposed to win…!?

Yukiko Amagi: A-Are we… going to die…?

Teddie: No! You guys can’t die! What can I do…? Sensei…

”Get out of here!” ✔
”Help us…”
”It’s up to you.”

Teddie: A-Abandon you…? Only I’d get away…? I can’t do that! Am I going to be all alone again…? No… That’s not what I want!

Kanji Tatsumi: Shit! It’s winding up again…!

Teddie: I… I…

Shadow Rise: Okie dokie, here we go again! Good bye… forever!

Yosuke Hanamura: Aw shit… It’s coming!

Teddie: M-My body’s moving on its own! Wh-Why am I stepping forward!? Wh-Whoaaaa! I-I feel like I’m going bear-serk! Grrrrr! I-I’ll do it! Take a good look… at Teddie’s last stand!

[Teddie going Super Saiyan.]

Shadow Rise: ……!? This high-energy reading… Is it coming from that weird thing…!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Teddie! The hell are you doing!?

Teddie: Roaaaaaaaaawr!

[There’s an explosion happens after which Teddie… deflates.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Teddie!

Kanji Tatsumi: Teddie! You idiot… You coulda died…

Teddie: Did I… Did I help…?

Yosuke Hanamura: You didn’t just help, you saved our lives!

Teddie: (bear-ily speaking) Neat…! I’m so glad… I didn’t want to be alone anymore…

Chie Satonaka: Teddie…

Teddie: Ngh… Urgh… Wh-What in the world!? Nooo… My fine, silky fur… I was so proud of it! Waaaah…

Yosuke Hanamura: Looks like he’s gonna be just fine… I guess.

Rise Kujikawa: Mm…? Where… am I…?

Yukiko Amagi: Rise-chan!

Rise Kujikawa: I’m sorry… It’s all my fault…

”No harm done.”
”It’s not your fault.”
”You can let go now.” ✔

Rise Kujikawa: Huh? Yeah… Haha… When was the last time someone said that to me…? (to her Shadow) Here, stand up. I’m sorry… You must’ve been in a lot of pain up to now. You’re part of me, but I kept refusing to admit you existed… I was trying to figure out who the real me was. But I realize now that I was on the wrong track. There is no ”real” me. It just doesn’t exist.

Teddie: There’s no… real me…?

Rise Kujikawa: You… me… even Risette… They were all born from me. All of them are… me.

> The strength of heart required to face oneself has been made manifest…

> Rise has faced her other self…

> She has obtained the facade used to overcome life’s hardships, the Persona Himiko!

Yosuke Hanamura: Rise-chan! Careful!

Rise Kujikawa: I’m all right… Hey, you’re the one who came to the store, right…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, yeah. And these guys came with me.

> You briefly introduced yourselves.

Rise Kujikawa: I thought I recognized you guys… Thanks, everyone…

Chie Satonaka: We’ll explain everything later, but for right now--

Yukiko Amagi: What’s wrong, Chie?

Teddie: There’s… no real me…?

Kanji Tatsumi: H-Hey, Teddie…

Rise Kujikawa: No, get back! Something’s coming out of him…!

Teddie’s voice: Real? Me? *chuckle* Such foolishness…

Yosuke Hanamura: What is that thing…!?

Chie Satonaka: D-Don’t tell me… Is that the other Teddie? Teddie’s hidden thoughts!?

Rise Kujikawa: I believe so, but it seems like there’s more… I felt some powerful presence intervene…

Teddie: Wh-What’s going on!? Wh-Whoaa!

Other Teddie: The truth is unattainable… It will always be shrouded in fog. Though you reach through the murk and the gloom to grasp something, you have no means to know it is the truth… In which case, why…? What sense is there in yearning for truth? Close your eyes. Lie to yourself. Live in blissful ignorance… It is a much smarter way to exist.

Teddie: Wh-What’re you talking about!? I don’t understand a word you’re saying! You’re just making it sound difficult because I’m not that smart! How rude! Maybe you can’t tell, but I’m thinking as hard as I can!

Other Teddie: It is those efforts that I am calling useless… You are hollow. Empty. At your core, you know this… You just cannot accept it. So you seek an alternate form… a denial of your nature. You have no lost memories. If you have forgotten anything, it is this truth.

Teddie: Th-That’s… a lie…

Other Teddie: Shall I spell it out for you? You are but a mere--

Teddie: I said shaddup!

Yukiko Amagi: Teddie!

Other Teddie: It is the same for you all… You undergo suffering because of your search for the truth… This world is filled with thick, heavy fog… How can you find something when you know not what you search for?

”What do you mean?”
”The truth has to exist.”
”There’s a way to find it.” ✔

Other Teddie: And thus, you invite more suffering upon yourselves… It is beyond my comprehension. Then I will grant you one truth… You will all die here. You sought the truth, only to find death…

Yosuke Hanamura: Dammit… How are we supposed to fight something like this without Teddie…?

Rise Kujikawa: It’s all right… Get ready, everyone.

Chie Satonaka: Hey, don’t tell me you’re fighting with us! You can’t take it!

Rise Kujikawa: I’m okay… I should be able to take that bear’s place! It’s my turn to save you all!

[She calls her Persona, Himiko. The battle begins. Creepy Teddie with huge claws comes out of a hole in the ground.]

CHAPTER 33: Shadow Teddie
Shadow Teddie: I am a shadow… The true self… I shall give you the ”truth” you claim to hold so dear… The inescapable fact of your death here!

Chie Satonaka: Was that creepy thing really inside our Teddie…?

Yosuke Hanamura: I guess he was a lot more troubled than he looked… We have to save him!

Shadow Teddie: Foolish beings! Accept your end with dignity and grace! Stop this futile struggling. Even if you resist, it will all come to naught…

Rise Kujikawa: What…? I have a bad feeling about this…  It’s… It’s going to attack! Get ready!

Shadow Teddie: What…? How can you summon such strength for such a futile endeavor…!? Why do you still resist…!? Even should you win, naught but suffering awaits!

[Finally Teddie’s Other Self is defeated!]

Yukiko Amagi: Was that part of you, Teddie…?

Chie Satonaka: Even Teddie had a hidden side…

Teddie: I… I don’t know who I am…

Other Teddie: ……

Teddie: I’ve thought a number of times… that maybe there is no answer… But I’m here… I live here…

”I’m sure you’ll find it.”
”Don’t worry about it.”
”You’re not alone.” ✔

Teddie: Then… I don’t have to do this all on my own…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude, we’ll help you figure it out.

Yukiko Amagi: I’m sure we’ll find out about you, as we continue investigating this world.

Teddie: Y-You guys…! I’m… I’m one lucky bear! Waaaah…

Chie Satonaka: Is that…?

Yosuke Hanamura: A Persona…?

> The courage of heart to support one’s friends has been made manifest…

> Teddie has faced his other self…

> He has obtained the facade used to overcome life’s hardships, the Persona Kintoki-Douji!

Teddie: Is this my Persona?

Rise Kujikawa: I can sense strong power from it… It’s awesome, Teddie…

Chie Satonaka: Whoa! Are you all right!? Oh yeah, your Persona just awakened too! I’m so sorry… You must be worn out.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, let’s hurry outside!

Yukiko Amagi: Are you feeling okay, Rise-chan? We’re almost outside.

Rise Kujikawa: I’m all right… I’m more worried about Teddie…

Kanji Tatsumi: You okay there? We gotta go back for now…

Teddie: I wanna be alone for a while.

Yosuke Hanamura: H-Hey…

Teddie: My beautiful fur is all rough and coarse… And my nose hasn’t been working too well either… So while I wait for my fur to grow back, I’m gonna train hard! Nobody can stop moi! Here goes! Huh!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What’s gotten into you…?

Teddie: Don’t, talk, to me, please! One more set! Huh! Huh! Another one! Huh! Huh!

Kanji Tatsumi: Leave the dude be… Comes a time when a man’s gotta stand on his own two feet.

Chie Satonaka: Uh, I’m not sure this is really one of those times…

Yukiko Amagi: Well then, Chie and I will take Rise-chan home.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, she’ll need a lot of rest. We can talk after she regains her strength.

Chie Satonaka: Well, um… Good luck, Teddie!

Teddie: Just kick back and wait for my wonderful comeback! Peace out!

”I’ll see you later.” ✔
”Good luck.”

Teddie: I said this before, but… I can sense something special about you, Sensei. There must be something that only I can do… That’s how I feel when I’m with Sensei. That’s why I’m gonna get stronger! To find my special thing! Raaaawr!

> Teddie is looking at you with fire in his eyes…

> The Teddie Social Link had reached level 2!

Teddie: Here goes! Huh! Huh!

> You should leave him be…

> In any event, you were able to rescue Rise safely.

> Now you must wait for her to recover.

> The mystery deepens…

> Will she be able to provide new insight into the case…?

[Evening. Drunk Dojima enters his home.]

Nanako Dojima: He’s back!

Tohru Adachi: Whoa, there! Careful now, Dojima-san.

Ryotaro Dojima: Ow! Dammit…! Who built a shtep here!?

Tohru Adachi: That’d be the carpenters, Sir. C’mon, don’t take your anger out on the house. That won’t solve anything.

Ryotaro Dojima: Whooo… I’m hooome. Nanako! I’m baaack!

Nanako Dojima: W-Welcome back…

Tohru Adachi: Oh, hi, Nanako-chan. Sorry, but could you go get his futon ready? Phew! I think he had a little too much to drink, haha.

Ryotaro Dojima: How else… *hic*… am I supposed to deal with this crap!? Friggin’ fancy-talkin’ kid… I’ve… I’ve been in this line’a work… since you were all learnin’ yer times tables!

Tohru Adachi: The prefectural police sent in special investigational support. ’Cause you know, we haven’t really made any progress on the serial murders since they started in April… Haha. So this ”special support” is supposedly a hot-shot detective from a well-known private agency… But you shoulda seen the look on my face when I met him! He’s only a kid your age! I hear he’s a pretty sharp cookie, though.

Ryotaro Dojima: Awww, he’s a brat like any other. Ain’t nothin’ he can do to help. *hic* He goes on and on about deductions and… deductions… Heh. Ace or no ace, the prefeckshure oughtta be more careful about giving us brats to babysit… Condes… Condescendin’ bashtards… *hic*

Tohru Adachi: The kid said, as long as he can be of assistance in solving a difficult case, he won’t require a reward. Well, you can imagine the shine the higher-ups took to him after that. So we can’t exactly turn him down…

Ryotaro Dojima: Adachi!

Tohru Adachi: Gah, sorry! Me and my big mouth…

Ryotaro Dojima: You run your jaw like this is all shome kinda joke… It’s your fault to begin with, for jumping the gun and hauling in that Peeping Tom!

Tohru Adachi: Oh… Haha, um…

Ryotaro Dojima: And you! You’cn take your share of the blame, too… Always wandering around crime scenes whenever somethin’ happens…

> You were scolded by Dojima…

Nanako Dojima: His futon’s ready.

Tohru Adachi: Alright, Dojima-san, up and at ’em. Nanako-chan got your futon all ready for you!

Ryotaro Dojima: Nnh… Mmmm…

Nanako Dojima: ……Sure does stink like sake in here…

June 26th, 2011. Saturday. Home.
> You have the day off school today.

> All you can do for now is wait for Rise’s recovery.

CHAPTER 34: Meat Gum
> Samegawa Flood Plain

Old woman: That idol girl named Rise… Is it true she’s the girl from Marukyu Tofu? Well, well, who knew something like that would come outta that little shop. I hear all kinds of things about her.

> You gave her the Old Key.

Old woman: Ah…! I’ve gotta be honest with you, though… I’ve already opened it. You know my daughter? Well, I spoke to her, and… we found the key together. But the fact that you were looking for it was quite flattering, young man. And so I couldn’t tell you that we opened it already… I’m sorry… It is true that you found a key for me, though. I should give you something for your troubles. Ah! I know, how would you like a ”secret lesson?” Don’t worry, it’s free of charge. Ohoho, this brings back fond memories… Now listen up. If you want to get close to a girl, the first thing to know is that you can’t ruffle her feathers. You have to keep telling her exactly what it is she wants to hear. That’s a surefire way to win her heart! And when the timing is just right, that’s when you confess your love to her! But that’ll end in a rejection if you haven’t caught her eye before that. You’ll be stuck being friends forever if you can’t win her attention somehow. Basically, it all comes down to your actions that’ll sway them from being lovers or just plain friends. Well, that’s about all I can tell you… Good luck.

> You listened to the old woman’s ”secret lesson”…

> Your Knowledge has greatly increased.

> Your Courage has greatly increased.

> Shopping District - Velvet Room

Marie: Oh… You’re here. Hey, why don’t you take me somewhere?

> Spend the day with Marie?

Yes ✔
No

> Marie looks happy…

Marie: Hey, can I see a ”school”? You’re going to one, right? I wanna go see what that’s like.

> You decided to take Marie to school…

> Samegawa flood plain…

> You decided to take Marie to school with you…

Marie: You go to ”school” every day, right? You don’t get tired of it?

”It’s fun.” ✔
”It’s pretty much my duty.”
”I skip it sometimes.”

Marie: Fun…? Oh, do they have a TV there? Can you watch ”StarScandalz”?

> Though she misunderstands, Marie seems to be enjoying this…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yo, partner! Whatcha do-- Oh, hey, Marie-chan? It’s been a while, hasn’t it? I heard that you’d been with Chie and Yukiko. So you’re showing her around, huh? What are you guys doing? Out on a stroll?

”I’m showing her the school.” ✔
”Come with us.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? You are?

> You tell Yosuke how Marie wants to see the school…

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, I get it. Marie-chan goes to a different school, after all, huh. Er, still… What could be special about our school? Oh, well. All right, I’ll join ya. Allow me to welcome you to Yasogami High! Heheh!

Marie: Can I go inside?

Yosuke Hanamura: No problem. School’s out today, but there’s still some people around. We can go in. I mean, we can always say that we’re showing you around the school!

> Yasogami High, 2nd floor hall…

Yosuke Hanamura: …And, here’s our classroom. Pretty retro, huh? I guess you could call it cozy.

Marie: …It’s so big.

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? It is…? Well, there’s a lot of empty land here… I guess the school’s pretty big if you count the fields and yards and stuff. What about where you are, Marie-chan? Is it cramped, since it’s in the city?

Marie: Me? ……It’s tiny. I mean, it’s a single room.

Yosuke Hanamura: One room!? …Seriously? Is it, uh… some kind of advanced placement class or something?

Marie: I don’t know. It’s small, it’s dark, The Nose never says anything. Nobody ever says anything. It’s boring.

Yosuke Hanamura: The Nose…? Is that, uh, what you call your teacher? A teacher who doesn’t talk… Isn’t that neglecting your job?

Marie: Hey, I want to see more. There’s still more to see, right?

> It seems Marie is very interested in your school…

Yosuke Hanamura: …She’s as strange as she was last time. Then again, everybody I’ve gotten to know recently has been pretty much on the odd side, so I’m used to it. Haha…

> Yasogami High, Rooftop…

Yosuke Hanamura: …And this is where we hang out. What do you think? Isn’t this a great place to spend your youth?

Marie: Youth? How does someone spend youth? Give me an example.

Yosuke Hanamura: An e-example!? Well, y’know, um… building friendships, sharing your concerns, confiding in each other… stuff like that?

Yosuke Hanamura: It’s kinda awkward to have to put it into words…

Marie: …I don’t get it. Do Green and Black do that, too?

”Of course.” ✔
”You spend youth with everyone.”

Marie: Why do you need to spend youth? Don’t you have anything better to do?

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-You want me to say more? Er, well… I mean, it’s fun. Not being in superficial relationships… Being with people who know the real you.

Marie: …The real you?

Yosuke Hanamura: Being with people like that helps keep me from losing sight of who I am. Y’know, so I can face myself… Arrrrrgh! This is embarrassing! I can’t say any more! Sorry!

Marie: Face yourself…

”Let it go.” ✔
”Let’s spend our youths.”
”Wondering about your ’true self’?”

Marie: What? Let what go? I don’t know what you mean.

> Marie doesn’t seem to understand what is happening…

Yosuke Hanamura: Let’s just… end this here. Please, forget I said anything. So, um… I know! You haven’t seen the library yet, right!? We don’t have all day, so let’s get going!

Marie: Face your true self…?

> It seems Marie is wondering about the meaning of what Yosuke said…

> You feel like you understand Marie a bit more now…

> The Marie Social Link has reached level 4!

Marie: …Let’s go.

> After showing Marie around the school with Yosuke, you escort Marie back to the Velvet Room…

[Evening. Shopping District.]

Tohru Adachi: Hm? What a coincidence. What are you doing out so late? It’s dangerous, you know. Go home.

> Adachi seems to be on his way home from work…

> Since you have Gurr, a Persona of the Jester Arcana, you two might get along well…

> Will you spend the evening with Adachi?

Yes ✔
No

Tohru Adachi: You must have a lot of time on your hands. Dojima-san will be on your ass, you know.

> Adachi is smiling mischievously…

> Shopping District, Souzai Daigaku…

Tohru Adachi: I knew it! Stores out here close too soon. I got off work early, so I thought I’d make something, but then I got lazy. What should I do? I have tons of nimono at home…

Old woman: Why, Tohru-chan! How is work? Are you still working hard?

Tohru Adachi: Oh… H-Hi. Yeah, I just got off…

Old woman: Have you had dinner yet? You’re young! You need to eat up! Would you like to come to my house? I’m making your favorite--nimono!

Tohru Adachi: Oh, uh, today? I’ve… got a… That’s right! I promised this kid I’d eat dinner with him. He’s my boss’ nephew, so I can’t say no… Haha, maybe next time.

Old woman: Oh… That’s too bad. Well, next time, then! Good night.

Tohru Adachi: …She really sucks away my will to live. Can you imagine how awkward dinner would be, just me and her!? I don’t really like her nimono, anyway. The lotus root is too tough. Oh, uh, sorry for using you like that. You were a big help.

”Why don’t you come over for real?” ✔
”You shouldn’t lie to her.”
”I was a big… kelp?”

Tohru Adachi: At Dojima-san’s? Well, isn’t that a generous offer.

> Adachi is looking at you in surprise.

Tohru Adachi: But Dojima-san’s still at work, right? Does that mean it’ll be just us? Isn’t that weird?

”I’m a good cook.” ✔
”Nanako will be happy.”

Tohru Adachi: You’re seriously inviting me over? You don’t think it’d be awkward?

> Adachi is looking at you like you’re a rare breed…

Tohru Adachi: Well, I am interested to see what you’re like as a cook. When I was in high school, I never gave cooking a single thought.

”What did you do instead?” ✔
”What kind of student were you?”

Tohru Adachi: I just studied, and studied. It was a pretty good school where your grades really mattered. I didn’t mind, though. You get back as much as you put in. Everyone knows that. My parents didn’t care what else I did as long as my grades were good, too. But that works out when you’re a student.

”Is having a job hard?”
”You don’t enjoy yourself now?” ✔

Tohru Adachi: I dunno. Grown-ups have a lot on their plates.

Tohru Adachi: But I guess lately, things have been fun. It’s nice to know there’s something I’m good at. Haha, this is embarrassing.

June 27th, 2011. Monday. School.
Mr. Morooka: Don’t get god damn carried away just because some scatterbrained idol is back in town! That’s Rise, for all you out-of-the-loop morons. All she does are variety shows and silly commercials! What’s the damn point of running your mouths about some half-wit whose only talent is appearing on shows for idiots? This class seems to be full of students without their own identities! Isn’t that right? …Why the hell do you all look so upset!? Stand your ass up, Yu! Answer this: What is identity?

”Uniqueness.”
”Difference.”
”Individuality.” ✔

> You gave the answer you think is correct…

Mr. Morooka: Ah, I see you’ve already done the reading, smartass. Anyway, that’s right. Identity is individuality! And individuality is the feeling that you are authentic and genuine! Those with identity would never take a liking to idols like that! You immature kids gain your identity by mimicking the idols you love… But I doubt that those who imitate others have any true identity of their own!

> You gave the correct answer…

> Your Knowledge has increased.

Ema: I want to clear my mind of snacks. I want to hate them.

> It seems the fox wants you to fulfill the wish written on the ema on its behalf.

[You go to the Shopping District.]

Slim woman: Don’t bother me! I’m channeling my mental energy in order to control my urges… I mustn’t want snacks… They’ll just make me faaaat… Shiroku Store is my enemy… Remember all that dieting and exercise… Do you want to have to do all that again? Must shun the snacks… Ahhh! Snacks… I want to eat snacks! *sigh* I wonder if there’re any bad-tasting snacks. Actually, it doesn’t have to be bad… Maybe if it were just odd-tasting, I would stop thinking about them…? I want to distance myself from those Shiroku snacks…

> Perhaps she’s the one who wrote the ema request the fox showed you.

[You run to the school and go up to the roof where Chie is resting.]

Chie Satonaka: Speaking of snacks, you ever get hungry inside the TV? Maybe I should bring something with me next time…

[You get back to the Shopping District.]

> It seems she is looking for a snack that isn’t like the snacks that she’s currently craving.

Slim woman: What’s this smell…!? It smells juicy, raw, and yet sweet… Is this the rumored Meat Gum!?  *gulp* Hey, can I have a bit? I want to try it.

Give her some
Don’t give her any

> You gave the woman Meat Gum.

Slim woman: Urp!! Wh-What is this!? It’s chewy meat! This is also considered a snack!? The world of snacks is indeed vast and infinite. …Well, that was certainly different and odd. When I think ”snack” I’ll definitely recall this taste now. Thank you… Now I won’t linger in front of the Shiroku Store any more. Oh, yes. I need to visit the shrine. I made a wish to hate snacks there. I’ll use my snack money as an offering!

> It seems like the monetary offerings will increase.

> The fox will be happy about this…

[You go back to school and walk up to Yosuke.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, Yu. Got a minute? I’ve got an offer I think you might be interested in!

Yosuke Hanamura: Phew, I’m dead tired… They decided on the sale at the last minute, and Dad was bugging me to find helpers. I told him I didn’t have time for that, but he wasn’t listening. But hey, I’m glad you were there! Thanks.

”No problem.”
”Tell me next time!”
”It was fun.” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Really? Felt like nothing but a big pain to me. You’re amazing.

> Yosuke is surprised…

[Two girls walking to them.]

Gaudy student: Oh, Hanamura. What’s with the crowd today? It’s way busy. If I’d known, I woulda skipped out.

Yosuke Hanamura: Please don’t. You got a bonus for today, right?

Snooty student: Yeah, a whole 500 yen. I’m trying to save up! Gimme a raise.

Yosuke Hanamura: Well… I don’t think I can help you there…

Snooty student: What’s the point, then?

> The two began talking nearby…

> They’re talking very loudly…

Gaudy student: At this rate, my graduation trip’ll be somewhere in Japan. Maybe I should ask my parents to pay for it.

Snooty student: Why don’t you find a guy to pay?

Gaudy student: Haha, like Saki did?

Yosuke Hanamura: ……

> Yosuke is biting his lip…

Snooty student: Was it during our second year? When Saki eloped, I mean.

Gaudy student: Yep. Apparently she got with a college guy who came home, and went off with him. But she came right back, saying she’d save money and leave on her own.

Snooty student: Huh? You mean she was dumped?

Gaudy student: Who knows… She started working here to save money, didn’t she? You know us high school girls can make easy money if we really want to.

> The pair’s gossiping continues…

Yosuke Hanamura: It doesn’t matter. It’s just hot air. I’m not letting it get to me. …It’s sad to be talked about like that, though. We’re the only ones who can avenge Saki-senpai. …… We’re special. We’re the only ones. So… there’s no need to bother with outsiders.

”You’re right.”
”Man, you’re mature.” ✔
”No need to hold back…”


Yosuke Hanamura: Haha… I saw the kid in me inside the TV. I felt I needed to change…

Ryotaro Dojima: …Hah. You win…

Ryotaro Dojima: She… Nanako’s mother was run over on her way to pick up Nanako from nursery school. It was a cold day, and there were no witnesses, so they didn’t find her until much later. Until they got word to me, Nanako was waiting all that time at the nursery… All alone. Waiting for a mother who would never come… …I couldn’t tell Nanako that her mother was killed. That her father, whose job is to catch criminals… couldn’t find a single lead… …… But I haven’t given up. I’ll catch the guy. I don’t need a private life to do that. …Nanako will understand.

”You’re right.”

Even the lady from the neighborhood association came. Funny how she never actually spoke to Sis before… Then they all tell me, ”You need to live an admirable life for your sister’s sake.” It’s suffocating.

Snooty student: How come you’re favoring Kazumi, huh!? You were like that with Saki, too!

Yosuke Hanamura: …Huh?

Gaudy student: Don’t try to hide it! We all know! You liked Saki and treated her special!

Yosuke Hanamura: …… I don’t think Saki-senpai has anything to do with this subject.

Gaudy student: Yeah, it does!! You told the other workers to take it easy on Saki too, didn’t you? You think you can do anything just because you’re the manager’s son!?

Snooty student: So it’s Kazumi now that Saki’s dead!? Don’t even bother, she has a boyfriend. Didn’t you get it!? Saki didn’t like you! We heard so from her! She may have acted that way, but…

> They started to badmouth Saki-senpai…

”Shut up!” ✔
”Calm down, man…”
”I feel bad for Saki-senpai.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Yu…

Snooty student: Wha--Who are you!? You shut up!

Yosuke Hanamura: You’re the ones who should shut up!! What do you know about Saki-senpai!? She didn’t do things half-assed like you! She looked lazy, but she worked hard! She talked bad, but she was good inside! So she hated me? I knew that! She’s not here anymore! I’m left behind! …Just leave me alone.

Gaudy student: Wh-What the heck…?

Snooty student: …Let’s go.

[They leave.]

Yosuke Hanamura: …… I just blurted out a buncha crap, huh?

”You were just upset.”
”Feel better now?”
”I know how it is.” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: How can you understand, when I don’t…? ……

> Yosuke quieted down…

Yosuke Hanamura: Damn… Another pathetic display from Yosuke, huh? …… Thanks, though. Hearing you say that stuff to them… It made me happy.

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* I don’t want to… I really don’t want to, but I’ll go talk with Dad… At this rate, those two are gonna quit… I should tell him and apologize… I don’t know… What do I want to do? I don’t get it… even though it’s my own future. …Sorry, but I’ll see you later, Yu.

> You saw Yosuke off and went home.

Mr. Morooka: …That’s it for Pascal. Did you get all that in your notes? Your brains aren’t smart enough to retain this just by listening. Make sure you write all this down for later review! Especially ”Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a thinking reed.” That’s incredibly important! Hey, are you paying attention, Yosuke Hanamura!? I doubt you have many deep thoughts going on in your daily life. Who said this: ”Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a thinking reed”?

Yosuke Hanamura: Aw, crap. I was spacing out, and he totally caught me…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yu, Yu! You gotta help me out!

”Pascal.” ✔
”Descartes.”
”Nietzsche.”

> You gave him the arswer think is correct.

Mr. Morooka: Oh…? I see that you did pick up on something I was saying while sitting there with that stupid look on your face. ”Man is but a reed, but he is a thinking reed” came from the mind of Blaise Pascal. Write that down! All right, so if man is a thinking reed, do you know what an un-thinking reed is? An un-thinking reed is just a reed! So I expect you idiots to at least keep thinking! And read some books!

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, thank God, Yu. I don’t know what he would’ve said if I’d given the wrong answer…

Yosuke Hanamura: I see. Thanks, man…

> Samegawa riverbank…

> You wandered here with a pensive Yosuke…

> Yosuke is holding something…

Yosuke Hanamura: …I found this. It’s a Print Club sticker I took with Saki-senpai… When I first got here, she insisted on taking it… Back then… somewhere inside me, I thought I was above this place… A lot of people saw me as the enemy because Junes was going to ruin the shopping district… But… when I met her, she told me, ”Parents are parents. You’re you…” Even if she didn’t really mean it… it made me happy. Because of her… I started to think maybe this town wasn’t all that bad. But then…

”She dumped you?”
”She died?” ✔

Yosuke Hanamura: Why…? Why did she… have to… die…? It pisses me off… It makes me mad! I wanted to talk with her more! I wanted to get to know her better! But… She’s… not here anymore.

> Yosuke is sobbing out loud…

Yosuke Hanamura: … I get it now… I wanted to forget about Saki-senpai. How she’s not here anymore… I wanted to forget that… I was living a boring life in the middle of nowhere. When the murders started, I got excited… I thought there was finally a point to me being in Inaba… I thought I could forget Senpai was gone… and the fact that I was such a loser… I jumped at the murders and never once thought about what I was doing… I… didn’t even take the first step… I’m sorry… Saki-senpai. I’m sorry… Yu.

”Just take it slow.” ✔
”I understand…”
”Don’t apologize.”

Yosuke Hanamura: …Yeah.

> Yosuke nodded with red eyes…

Yosuke Hanamura: But I think I’m awake now… I need to get over the fact that Saki-senpai isn’t coming back… That when this case ends… I’ll have nowhere to run… And I won’t have changed… …… …You made me realize that.

> It seems you were able to act as Yosuke’s crutch…

> You feel a bond between you and Yosuke…

”If you say so.” ✔
”It’s okay, I’ll wait.”

Daisuke Nagase: Ah… Perfect timing. Later.

[He leaves. Kou approaches.]

Kou Ichijo: Hm? What’s up with the cold shoulder? Daisuke can be such a damn rebel. Oh well, I guess that makes it easier. I need to talk to you. Tell you what, we’ll talk over mapo rice. My treat!

”Sounds good.” ✔
”You treated last time.”

Kou Ichijo: Great! Heck, I’ll get you a large!

> Kou looks happy…

> You left school to listen to what Kou has to say.

> Central shopping district, Chinese Diner Aiya…

Kou Ichijo: You probably guessed this, but it’s about Daisuke.

> Kou speaks with a serious expression…

Kou Ichijo: You’ve noticed him slacking off at practice a lot lately, right? He never used to do that kinda stuff… Before, he woulda died for any chance to play soccer. You practically had to pry the ball away from him, even off the field. But now he’s half-assing everything… I don’t get it. Maybe he just doesn’t think playing hard is ”cool” anymore… He took it seriously when he was helping you train, though, right? He really wanted you to get good enough for the team to accept you… Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think he was faking it or anything… But… I wonder if part of that was him trying to make you do the things he feels like he can’t anymore… …He’s fooling himself. It just pisses me off to watch him do this…

> Kou sighs…

Kou Ichijo: How did he get like this…? Ya know, his new attitude toward girls is pretty sudden, too. He used to talk about girls like any normal guy would. You think it could be related…?

”Could be…” ✔
”Maybe not…”
”What are we talking about?”

Kou Ichijo: You think so too?

> Kou nods…

Kou Ichijo: He can be a little blunt sometimes, but he’s a nice guy. He’s been acting so cold toward girls, though, like he’s saying stuff that he doesn’t really mean… …… I’m only telling you this because I trust you, but… ……

> Kou begins to speak slowly…

Kou Ichijo: See, Daisuke had a girlfriend back in middle school… But from what he told me, they never even held hands. Then she broke up with him. She made a big scene. She was all like, ”You don’t even like me, do you!?” I heard she even slapped him. And ever since then, he’s been saying stuff like, ”I don’t know what it means to like someone…” At the rate he’s going, he’s gonna die an old hermit.

> Kou sighs…

Kou Ichijo: What do you think?

”We’ve got a problem.” ✔
”It’s Daisuke’s problem.”

Kou Ichijo: Yeah, I think so too.

> Kou nods.

Kou Ichijo: Whoa! I just had a great idea. I’m a genius… You’re with me on this, right? You’re gonna help him?

> Kou is looking at you expectantly…

”Count me in.” ✔
”Count me out.”

Kou Ichijo: Alright! Now we’re talking!

[Marie’s Letter]

”You Killed Me”
You are a murderer.
By your silent smile, by your composed voice,
By your dark eyes, by your bashful fingers
I am slain.
I am a corpse.
Foolish, wretched, happy.
Surely I’ll simply rot away…
My last words…
Adieu, au revoir… mon cheri.
(Goodbye, farewell… my love.)

> ……

> This must be another of Marie’s poems.

Marie: …Rrrraaaaaahhhhh! Whyyyyyy! ? Why is this happening!? What is this doing here……? But however it stop reading them! If you keep doing that, your eyes are gonna rot out! They’ll rot away and you’ll be sorry you read my stuff! …… Ihateyouyousuckmurderer. Stop reading!

Marie: This doesn’t make sense… I wouldn’t leave this here…

”Why do you buy so much?”
”We’ll have to come back.” ✔
”Stop complaining.”

Ai Ebihara: I’ll get something next time, but I want something today, too. I came here to buy, not to look.

> Ai looks enthusiastic…

Ai Ebihara: Hey, I’m thirsty. Buy me an ice latte.

”Sure.”
”Buy it yourself.” ✔
”Let’s split one.”

Ai Ebihara: Huh…? Did you seriously just say that? You’re probably the first guy who’s ever taken that tone with me.

> Ai is surprised…

Saleswoman: Oh, Ai-chan! You’re back again?

Ai Ebihara: …Well, yeah?

Saleswoman: Are you looking for anything in particular today? Oh, we got a purse in that’s just your style! The guys’ll be alllll over you!

Ai Ebihara: …That’s all right. I’m not shopping for purses today.

Saleswoman: Ooh, is that your boyfriend? He’s quite a handsome one! Are you gonna introduce him to me? I’ve had the worst luck with men lately! We were at the bar the other night--

Ai Ebihara: Sorry, we’ve really gotta get going. I’ll be back.

> You returned to the station…

Ai Ebihara: *sigh* I hate salespeople. I’m the one keeping them in business, why do they have to pounce on me every time I go in there? They should get rid of all salespeople and put in vending machines. Press a button, and out come your clothes.

”Sounds like a good idea.”
”That’d be kind of boring.” ✔

Ai Ebihara: You think so? But what’s the point of all that petty small talk? I can see right through it… There’s no such thing as a relationship without ulterior motives.

> Ai looks somewhat sad…

Ai Ebihara: I don’t know why, but I got a little annoyed when she was talking about you back there. She said you were handsome. Good for you, I guess.

Ryotaro Dojima: What… ? You’re working part-time in the evenings? …… Hey… I’m your guardian, you know? Do you think I’m going to allow you to do something like this?

”You should.”
”Probably not.” ✔

Ryotaro Dojima: Ha… You’re an honest one. I have to give you some credit for mentioning this, considering how you expect me to react. Sheesh… All right, I’ll allow it. I believe you. It’s better than having you sneaking out behind my back. But, even though this is a small town in the countryside, there’s a lot of chances to get into trouble. Watch out. It’s a promise. Got it?

July 7th, 2011. Thursday. School.
Mr. Hosoi: Today, we’ll look at Yukichi Fukuzawa’s ”Gakumon no Susume,” or ”An Encouragement of Learning.” Now, open up your textbooks. This ”Gakumon no Susume” has a reference to the U.S. Declaration of Independence. It’s apparent once you start reading. There’s a famous line at the beginning: ”It is said that heaven does not create one man above or below another man.” ”Gakumon no Susume” is famous for this line, however, the ”It is said” portion shows that it is a reference. So this famous quote is a quotation in itself… Are you listening, Yu-chan? What is the beginning of ”Gakumon no Susume” a reference to?

”The Bible.”
”The Japanese constitution.”
”The U.S. Declaration of Independence.” ✔

> You gave the answer you think is correct…

Mr. Hosoi: Yes, it is referencing the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Before writing ”Gakumon no Susume,” Fukuzawa wrote ”Seiyo Jijo,” or ”Conditions of the West.” In that book, he actually translates the entire Declaration into Japanese. So he similarly used the reference in ”Gakumon no Susume.” Well, let’s move on. ”Any existing distinction between the wise and the stupid…”

> You gave the correct answer…

> Your Knowledge has increased.

Yukiko Amagi: I mean… I couldn't face my parents again…

Kimono-clad woman: Oh, Yuki-chan!

Kimono-clad woman: Taking a little break after ordering from the liquor store. *sigh* So now you know.

Yukiko Amagi: O-Oh, I won't tell…

Kimono-clad woman: Hahaha, just kidding. Oh! Is that the rumored boyfriend? I see… That hard work in the kitchen paid off, huh?

Yukiko Amagi: I-It's not like that!!

Kimono-clad woman: Wow, your face is burning red. Well, I'll let you two be alone!

[She leaves.]

Yukiko Amagi: Sh-Sheesh… I-I'm sorry about that. Oh, that was one of our waitresses. They all have the wrong idea… I'm really sorry…

”It's okay.”
”They're not mistaken.” ✓

Yukiko Amagi: Huh…? S-Stop that… That kind of joke's not very funny…

> Yukiko seems to be sweating unnaturally…

Yukiko Amagi: Kasai-san is teaching me how to cook, along with the other waitresses and chefs. I said I'd learn on my own, but I kept messing up… I burnt myself a couple of times… ”Please let us teach you,” they said. *giggle* It's usually the other way around, you know? They use up their break time for my lessons… They're so nice to me… When I was halfway successful one time, everyone gathered around and taste-tested it, saying how good it was… I didn't know what to say… I was just happy… Plus I have my friends at school… All things considered, I'm pretty lucky… I want to do my best… For everyone's sake…

Chie Satonaka: Hey, over here! Yosuke went over to check out the scene. He should be back soon…

Yosuke Hanamura: *gasp* Yeah, it was murder all right. The body was hanging upside down on an apartment's rooftop railing…

Yukiko Amagi: But… how could that…?

Yosuke Hanamura: That's not all. The victim this time… It was King Moron.

Chie Satonaka: K-King Moron…!?

Kanji Tatsumi: You mean THAT King Moron!? Senpai's homeroom teacher?

Chie Satonaka: Wh-Why…!? What on earth's going on here!?

Yosuke Hanamura: How am I supposed to know!? But I talked to a guy there who saw it! It's true… There's no mistake.

Kanji Tatsumi: Gotta be shitting me… Ain't the killer targeting people who get shown on TV? I ain't never seen King Moron on the Midnight Channel, or any other programs!

Yosuke Hanamura: Why…? Why did this happen?

Chie Satonaka: I thought we finally figured some things out… Were they all just a big coincidence…?

Yukiko Amagi: Maybe the Midnight Channel doesn't have anything to do with this…

Yosuke Hanamura: Dammit! We came so far, and now we're back to square one!? Were we in over our heads, trying to catch a culprit that even the police couldn't find…?

”It's too early to give up.” ✓
”We have to move on.”
”Let's leave it to the police.”

Kanji Tatsumi: Damn straight! We started this thing 'cause the police can't tell their asses from their elbows. We give up now, and that shithead's gonna be on the loose forever. This ain't the time for bitching and moaning… We just gotta keep on keepin' on.

Yukiko Amagi: Kanji-kun…

Yosuke Hanamura: Hmph… Big talk from someone like you, Kanji.

Kanji Tatsumi: Wh-What's that s'posedta mean!?

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* I know… We're dealing with a murderer here. But we've all risked our lives to get this far… No way we'll back down. And we promised the bear, too…

Chie Satonaka: Hey, that's right! Maybe Teddie knows something about this!

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, since moping around won't do us any good, let's go see him!

[They go to the TV department.]

Chie Satonaka: Huh? There's staff here?

Yosuke Hanamura: Now that's unusual… Hi there. Did something happen?

Female employee: Ah, Yosuke-kun.

Male employee: Great timing. Did the manager tell you anything about this? There's been this weird mascot around our department for quite a while now… there some kind of campaign on today?

Yosuke Hanamura: Mascot…?

Female employee: He said his name was… Uh, what was it? Terry? Eddie?

Male employee: Well, there are no customers around, so I guess it's fine… I better get back to my station.

[They leave.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Please don't tell me…

Chie Satonaka: Whoa, h-he's here!

[Teddie relaxes in the massage chair.]

Teddie: Aaaaahhh. This really hits the spot.

Yosuke Hanamura: Wh-What the…? I mean, how'd you…?

Teddie: It took you guys long enough! I've been waiting.

Yukiko Amagi: Teddie, are you okay on this side!?

Kanji Tatsumi: How did you even leave your side!?

Teddie: Of course I can come out. There's an exit. It just never occurred to me to do it before. But spending time with you all sparked my curiosity about this world! I did wonder if it was a good idea, but my feet started moving before I could decide. And when I thought about it, I had nowhere to go, and it was a waste to go back. So I waited here for you. Oh, someone asked for my name. So I told them, ”I'm Teddie.”

Chie Satonaka: So that's why…

Yukiko Amagi: Oh yeah, there's something we need to ask you! How long have you been here, Teddie? Did anyone enter the other world?

Teddie: I stayed until the fog settled in on my side, but no one came.

Yosuke Hanamura: You're positive? You really didn't sense a single person?

Teddie: I just said that I didn't! I was there all by myself, like always. Hmph!

Yosuke Hanamura: And your nose wasn't clogged or anything…?

Teddie: Grrrr, aren't you listening!? I was utterly, totally, and 100% alone! That's why I came over here! But I can understand if you don't believe me. My senses aren't that good lately anyways…

”I believe you.” ✓
”It's hard to believe.”

Teddie: Oh! Sensei's heart is radiating pure kindness…!

Chie Satonaka: Well, it's true that the Midnight Channel was blank last night. And even before that… Teddie says he didn't sense anything, right? Does that mean… King Moron was never on that side?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hmm… What's going on?

Teddie: Hey, hey, I wanna go somewhere!

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? Now ain't the time, dude… You seriously don't plan on going back, do you? Where do you wanna go, anyway?

Teddie: I want to give this toRise-chan. It's for her.

> You received glasses from Teddie.

Teddie: Rise-chan will probably back us up from now on! So I'm gonna fight alongside you with everything I got! Don't think of me as the same cute little Teddie! I'm an all-new model! I have a powerful attack, an unbeatable defense, and a winning smile! Today begins the New Legend of Teddie!

Yukiko Amagi: Wow… A new legend…

> …Teddie has joined the group as a front line fighter!

> He'll definitely be a strong asset in your battle against the Shadows.

> The Investigation Team Social Link has reached level 5!

> Your power to create Personas of the Fool Arcana has grown!

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh-oh, people are starting to stare… Keep it down, will ya Ted!? C'mon, let's go somewhere else! 

[They go to the food court.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Okay, just to make sure, I'm gonna ask you one last time. Nobody was over there, except for you, until the fog came back. Correct?

Teddie: That's what I've been saying.

Chie Satonaka: He didn't show up on the Midnight Channel either…

Kanji Tatsumi: What's up with that?

Yosuke Hanamura: No clue… But I think we can be sure now that King Moron was never thrown into the TV.

Chie Satonaka: Then what, he was killed over here? Why not throw him into a TV, like all the rest?

”They couldn't throw him in.” ✓
”They never intended to.”
”I don't know.”

Yosuke Hanamura: They couldn't…? Well, they've done it a bunch of times already, but I guess everyone screws up sometimes…

Yukiko Amagi: Maybe the culprit thought he couldn't kill any more people by throwing them into TVs. I mean, we prevented his last three attempts in a row.

Chie Satonaka: Ahhh, I get you… That could be it!

Kanji Tatsumi: So they snuffed someone on our side this time to make sure it worked. Dammit… If that's true, then we have no way of preventing more murders unless we catch the killer!

Chie Satonaka: We need more clues… I wonder if Rise-chan's up and around yet.

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah… We'll have to put our hopes on her.

Teddie: *sigh* It's so hot out. …I'm taking this off.

Yosuke Hanamura: Wait, you're not talking about your head, are you!? Cut it out! There's kids watching!

[He hits him on the head, preventing him from taking it off.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Geez… They'll be scared for life if they see an empty mascot walking around. Have a little consideration, man.

Yukiko Amagi: I'm glad you're back to normal, though. Your fur's all fuzzy again!

Kanji Tatsumi: C-Can I… Can I feel it…?

Teddie: No! Actually, I'm no longer a hollow bear! Mwahaha! I trained and trained, hoping to someday score with Chie-chan and Yuki-chan… And now I finally have an inside!

Chie Satonaka: Yeah… good job with that.

Yukiko Amagi: Come on! Can't we give it a rest with the whole ”scoring” thing?

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude, you're hollow. Taking your head off isn't gonna cool you down!

Teddie: But I just told you! I'm not hollow anymore! Agh, it's too hot. I can't stand it…

[Anime cutscene. Teddie is very hot and can't sit in his chair.]

Teddie: (groans) It’s so hot!

[Teddie removes his ”head,” which turns out to be part of a zippered suit. Underneath the suit, the heroes discover a young man with designer hair.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa! What the…

Teddie?: Much… better….

Chie Satonaka: No way!

[Teddy drinks the bottle of refreshing drink that was on the table.]

Teddie?: Now that hit the spot.

[The cutscene ends.]

Teddie?: Hey, Chie-chan, Yuki-chan.

Chie Satonaka: Y-Yes…?

Teddie?: Do you have anything to wear? I'm basically like a newborn at the moment…

Chie Satonaka: T-Teddie? Is that really you…?

Yukiko Amagi: Umm…

Chie Satonaka: Wait, did you say you're like a newborn!? Then don't take the bottom part off! You need some clothes, right? C'mon, let's go look around…

[The girls leave with Teddie.]

Kanji Tatsumi: That's… Teddie…? He said he's not hollow anymore… So, like… he grew himself a body in there?

Yosuke Hanamura: What kinda creature would do that!? I mean… what IS he?……*sigh* Then again, this is hardly the first bizarre thing we've seen… And I gotta admit, it's probably better than him walking around in his bear suit. Oh, hey, weren't we gonna see about talking to Rise? I was so shocked that I lost track of what we were talking about. Let's head over to Rise's place. As for Teddie… He's with the girls, so he should be fine.

> You went home to change before heading to the shopping district…

[You with Yosuke and Kanji are standing outside the store eating ice cream.]

Kanji Tatsumi: Mmmm-mmm! It's finally the season for Topsicles again.

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude, how many are you going to eat? You're gonna get a stomach ache.

[The girls are coming back.]

Chie Satonaka: *gasp* Sorry we're late…

Yosuke Hanamura: How'd it take you that long to find clothes for Ted? Whoa…! I-Is that you, Teddie…?

[Teddie went from a clumsy bear to a classy, sophisticated young gentleman.]

Teddie: Oui, monsieur! How do I look?

”I didn't recognize you.”
”I liked you better before.” ✓
”C'est magnifique.”

Kanji Tatsumi: You lost the suit… Man, that sucks. I mean… that fuzziness was… Forget it! What're you lookin' at!?

Chie Satonaka: I have to say, it totally blew my mind, but he's Teddie alright. This guy had to make it a huge ordeal… Everything was new to him, so it turned into a big mess. He was so excited in the women's section that he started blabbering… Hey, you can't just go around doing whatever you please when you're in this form, got it?

Yukiko Amagi: Well, he can't help it. It's his first time in our world.

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* All right… You don't need to get all mopey like that. I never said I won't forgive you!

Teddie: I'm so glad! I was worried that you didn't like me anymore.

Chie Satonaka: *chuckle* Man… If you can behave yourself, you'll be pretty cute.

Yosuke Hanamura: Is he cute…? What do you think, Kanji?

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? What're you asking me for?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, I was just wondering if he was your type.

Kanji Tatsumi: Ohhh… I get it. What you're really asking is… ”Will you please beat the shit out of me, Kanji?”

Yukiko Amagi: Snrk… *chuckle*

Kanji Tatsumi: It ain't funny, Yukiko-senpai.

Yukiko Amagi: S-Sorr--heehee…

Chie Satonaka: *sigh* You'll have to forgive Yukiko. She's helpless when she gets this way…

Teddie: Oooh, please, everyone! Don't fight over me, baby!

Kanji Tatsumi: Shuddup! You picking a fight with me!?

Yukiko Amagi: Ahahahahahaha!

Yosuke Hanamura: Geez… oh well.

> Yosuke handed a 1000-yen bill to Kanji.

Yosuke Hanamura: Here, Kanji. Get whatever ice cream you want, just share it with Teddie. We're gonna head for the tofu shop. Wait here until we get back.

Teddie: Wow, you're rich!

Kanji Tatsumi: I can't just take this from you!

Yosuke Hanamura: Think of it as a welcome-back party for Teddie. Just don't go around making a racket.

Chie Satonaka: Whoa, Yosuke, what's gotten into you? You're acting like a real senpai all of a sudden. Oh, I get it. You might say differently, but you're still nice to Teddie. I'm glad Yosuke's developing into such a mature adult. Someone who doesn't let trifles bother him.

Yosuke Hanamura: What…? You're worrying me, Chie.

Chie Satonaka: Oh, it's about Teddie's clothes, that's all. We didn't have the money for them, so we charged the rest to you.

Yosuke Hanamura: Charge? WHAT!? You put it on my account!? What the hell, Chie!? I never said you could do that!

Chie Satonaka: What else were we supposed to do!? That stuff was expensive, even for Junes!

Yosuke Hanamura: You seriously charged it to me? Wh-Why would you do that!? You know I just bought a motorcycle! I'm broke!

Chie Satonaka: So? If you're already broke, a little more debt isn't going to make much of a difference.

Yosuke Hanamura: What!?

Teddie: C'mon, baby. Stop fighting over--

Yosuke Hanamura: Shuddup! This is your fault, y'know! Grrrrr… You listen here, Ted… You better take really, really, REALLY good care of that. If you put even a single tear in it, I'll make your next set of clothes out of the bear hide you took off!

Kanji Tatsumi: Yo Teddie, don't let it get you down. Let's go get some Topsicles.

[Kanji and Teddie leave for the store. Yosuke and Chie keep fighting.]

Yukiko Amagi: Let's go on ahead… I think they're going to be a while.

[You and Yukiko walk further down the road and notice a boy you've seen before.]

Hat-wearing boy: Ah… I had a feeling you'd come.

Yukiko Amagi: You're…!

Hat-wearing boy: Are you here to ingratiate yourself with Rise Kujikawa now?

Yosuke Hanamura: Geez… Why did the clerk even let them charge it to someone else…? Huh? W-Wait, you're that guy we saw with Kanji…!

Hat-wearing boy: Precisely. I don't believe we've met since then--In fact, I don't believe I've ever introduced myself. My name is Naoto Shirogane. I'm investigating the multiple murders that have occurred here. Mind if I ask you a few questions on the subject? The latest victim, Kinshiro Morooka… He was a teacher at the school you all attend, correct?

Chie Satonaka: S-So what?

Naoto Shirogane: The public is focused on the fact that he is associated with the second victim's school… But in truth, that's irrelevant. What intrigues me is the inconsistency. This Morooka… has never appeared on television. What do you make of that?

Yosuke Hanamura: …How are we supposed to know?

Naoto Shirogane: Well, we'll leave it at that. For my part, I'd like to solve this case as quickly as possible. I'll be keeping an eye on you all. Well then, until we meet again.

[He leaves.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Who is that guy…?

Chie Satonaka: It felt like he completely saw through us… He even knew about the TV thing.

[Suddenly Rise comes up to them.]

Rise Kujikawa: Oh… Hi.

Yukiko Amagi: Rise-chan! Are you okay now…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Good, good…

Rise Kujikawa: Are you all here to check up on me?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, yeah…

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, um… Do you guys have a moment? There's something I want to tell you. Follow me. My grandma's taking care of the shop today.

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? Sure, okay…

> Tatsuhime Shrine…

Rise Kujikawa: Yeah, I remember being at my house… When I came to, though, I was already in the other world.

Chie Satonaka: Still no real information on the killer…

Yosuke Hanamura: We met this weird kid named Naoto a second ago…

Rise Kujikawa: Oh… He's come to the shop several times. He asked me a lot about the incident. I didn't tell him anything about the other world, though. I figured it'd be a waste of time. Actually, he asked me about you guys too, but I just made up some stuff. Like, ”They found me unconscious on the roof at Junes.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, I guess that's close enough to the truth.

Rise Kujikawa: Um… so…

Chie Satonaka: Hm…? What's up?

Rise Kujikawa: Um… I-I really appreciate what you did for me… Thank you soooo much! I love you guys!

Chie Satonaka: Huh…? Awww, you don't have to thank us!

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude… She's so cute… Man, it's finally hitting me that you're the real deal. You really are Risette. 

Rise Kujikawa: Well, I know I sounded gloomy and all from stress, so… I-I thought you might not like me that way… Do I… sound weird? Oh, but I guess it sounds more ”natural” this way to the public… I'm sorry… I've practically lost touch with what the normal me is like.

Chie Satonaka: Haha, no need to apologize. Just do what comes naturally.

Yukiko Amagi: I think everyone has multiple sides to them. You don't have to force yourself to decide on just one.

Chie Satonaka: Haha, it sounds convincing when Yukiko says it.

Yukiko Amagi: Huh…? R-Really?

Rise Kujikawa: ……Thanks. *chuckle* I'm glad you're the first people I got to know here.

Chie Satonaka: Oh yeah, we almost forgot your present. The Teddie Glasses. Um, you don't have to take them, but… Well…

> Teddie gave you a pair of glasses to hold onto for when Rise joined you.

> But what should you say when giving them to her…?

Rise Kujikawa: Senpai… Would you be struggling without my help? I can help you in that world, right? With my power… So wouldn't it be better if I joined the team?

> You handed the glasses to Rise.

Yosuke Hanamura: These are kinda like proof that you're one of us…

> You explained the effect of the glasses to Rise.

Rise Kujikawa: I see… I do remember you all wearing glasses over there. Thanks, Senpai. Now I'm part of the team, too!

>Rise Kujikawa joined the group!

> She'll definitely be a strong asset in solving the case.

> The Investigation Team Social Link has reached level 6!

> Your power to create Personas of the Fool Arcana has grown!

Rise Kujikawa: I'll be going to Yasogami High, starting tomorrow. But I don't have any friends yet, so don't ignore me, alright? I do owe you my life, so… you know…

”Got it.”
”Leave it to me.” ✓
”If you put it that way…”

Rise Kujikawa: W-Wow… I didn't realize you were so cool, Senpai.

Yosuke Hanamura: This sure is a rough time to transfer here, though. The kidnappings, King Moron's death… All that, and exams are soon, too. *sigh* Exams… Now I'm depressing myself. I wonder if there's any chance they'll be canceled…

Chie Satonaka: I doubt it. They always hold exams, rain or shine…

Rise Kujikawa: *chuckle* I almost got killed by those monsters. Compared to that, exams are nothing.

Yosuke Hanamura: Alrighty then, let's discuss the case some more tomorrow at our special headquarters.

Kanji Tatsumi: Yo. How's it going? Dude, Teddie ate five Topsicles… Though if you count the ones I had before, that makes six, so I still win.

Yosuke Hanamura: No one asked…

Rise Kujikawa: We're all done talking already! Let's go, Senpai!

Kanji Tatsumi: Uh… When did you get so chipper?

Rise Kujikawa: Do you go to Yasogami, like Senpai? I'll be starting school there tomorrow, so I hope we get along too.

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh? Oh… cool. Uhh… What grade are you in?

Yukiko Amagi: …Snrk.

Yosuke Hanamura: So where's Teddie?

Kanji Tatsumi: He's over there, finishing up his fifth Topsicle. What are we gonna do with him?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well… I guess I'll take him home…

[Evening.]

[You return home. As usual, after dinner you and Nanako watch TV together.]

Announcer: Good evening, this is Niteline News. Our top story for the night concerns the latest developments in an ongoing story… The serial murder case in Inaba has claimed a third victim. The news shocked local residents, who have not seen another murder in three months, and assumed the spree had reached its end. The deceased taught at a local high school. Since his body was found arranged in a similar manner as the last two victims…

> King Moron's picture is on the news.

> It seems he really was murdered…

Nanako Dojima: What's wrong? Was it someone you know? …He died?

> Nanako seems scared…

”Don't worry.”
”They'll catch him.”
”I'm here with you.” ✓

> You calmed Nanako down…

> Your Understanding has increased.

Nanako Dojima: I'm all right…

> Nanako seems somewhat relieved.

Announcer: This marks the second consecutive death, after Ms. Saki Konishi's, where the target was involved with Yasogami High. Mr. Morooka was known for his strict teaching methods, and is said to have had constant friction with his students. The police will be pursuing this line of inquiry, and are planning to begin a large-scale investigation tomorrow. We now turn to our reporter at the scene for more details…

> The news is livelier than usual…

Nanako Dojima: Dad won't be coming home again today…

> Maybe you should try another magic trick…

> You move a finger on your right hand…

> …to your left hand!

Nanako Dojima: Huh!? Do it again, do it again!

> This time, you move a finger on the left hand…

> …to your right hand!

Nanako Dojima: It moved! Hey, how did you do that? Tell me, tell me!

> Nanako seems to have cheered up…

> You put Nanako to bed and decided to call it a night as well…

> This place…

Igor: Welcome. It's been quite some time…

> It seems that you've been called the Velvet Room…

Igor: Do not be alarmed. You are fast asleep in the real world… I have summoned you within your dreams. How are things proceeding…? Are you gradually drawing nearer to a solution to the mystery…?

”Yes.”
”No.”
”I don't know.” ✓

Igor: Indeed. The fog clouding your path is thick…

Margaret: The season has changed, but your future is not yet closed. In time, a path will open to you.

Igor: Our true reason for calling you here tonight is to provide a new form of assistance to help you achieve just that. Fusing Personas… Have you been using our services diligently? The aid we will henceforth provide is an advanced form of fusion… I speak of the power to fuse four or more Personas at once. I am quite certain that this will enable you to command even stronger powers…

> A new type of fusion is now available!

Igor: Now… your journey will soon reach its climax… And as a result, many challenges--which I cannot foresee at present--await you. Most interesting… *chuckle* Well, until we meet again… Farewell.

CHAPTER 38: Ms Kashiwagi
July 11th, 2011. Monday.
[Morning. You and Yosuke go to school.]

Yosuke Hanamura: I… couldn't get that much sleep yesterday. How about you? Are you alright?

”I'm okay.” ✓
”I'm depressed.”

Yosuke Hanamura: Well… If we start getting depressed over something like this we'll never catch the killer, huh? Hmm… Oh, yeah… this means we'll be getting a new homeroom teacher. I wonder who it'll be… …Well, I'm pretty sure that they won't be able to find anyone worse than King Moron.

> The classroom is bustling…

Male student: Hey, is that stuff about King Moron for real?

Female student: It was on TV, right? It must be true.

Ms. Kashiwagi: Goooood mornin'. I'm Noriko Kashiwagi, your new class teacher starting today. You all probably know already, but now that Mr. Morooka has passed away… I'll be taking good care of you instead. *giggle* Okay, why don't we start off with a moment of silence for Mr. Morooka. Close your eyes, everyone… That should be enough. I'll do my best to fill Mr. Morooka's shoes. So our regular exams are still on track for next week. As your principal said, ”It's times like these when the schedule is most important, Nori-chan.” *giggle* It must be tough for you. But that's what it means to become an adult, little by little.

Female student: I already can't stand her…

Male student: First King Moron and now Kashiwagi…? How much worse can it get?

Ms. Kashiwagi: Oh, and one more thing. That idol in our first-year class… Ms. Kujikawa, was it? In person, she's nothing like she seems on TV, so don't get your hopes up, mmkay? What's so great about an idol anyway, right class? She's just a piece of inexperienced jailbait.

> Ms. Kashiwagi is ranting on and on…

Brown-haired student: What's up with her…? Does she think she's Risette's rival?

Student's friend: She doesn't stand a chance against Rosette. I mean, I heard Kashiwagi is on the wrong side of 40…

> You can hear your classmates gossiping…

Brown-haired student: I bet King Moron would've been ecstatic to hear Risette had enrolled here. Someone told me they saw him buying Rise's pinup book…

Student's friend: That sounds kinda pervy. He annoyed the hell out of me, but I feel bad that he got killed…

Brown-haired student: Oh, you know what? Risette was on a striptease show.

Student's friend: Huh? A striptease!? Dude, if that was true, the paparazzi would've been all over it.

Brown-haired student: I'm serious! But the reception went bad right when it was getting to the good part… It was on that Midnight Channel everyone keeps talking about.

Student's friend: You actually believe that crap? How friggin' dense are you? Trust me, you were dreaming it…

Chie Satonaka: The rumor about the Midnight Channel is spreading further…

Yosuke Hanamura: We'd better wrap this case up quick. Anyways, let's meet up later. Don't make any plans for this afternoon.

[After school.]

Chie Satonaka: Ugh… Finals are next week… Blegh! It's been a while since I failed any subjects…

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, if by ”a while” you mean ”all the time.”

Chie Satonaka: Sh-Shut up! Like you've ever seen my scores!

Yukiko Amagi: But Chie always has above-average marks in the subjects that she doesn't fail!

Chie Satonaka: H-Hey! Why'd you tell him!? My scores just… vary! Yeah, that's it!

Rise Kujikawa: Ahaha!

Chie Satonaka: R-Rise-chan, you too…?

Rise Kujikawa: *giggle* Sorry… I'm not laughing at you. It's just… I thought it would take me a while to make any friends at my new school.

Chie Satonaka: Too bad we met under such awful circumstances.

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh yeah… What do you guys think about King Moron's case? He didn't show up on the Midnight Channel even once.

Teddie: If this person had been inside the TV, I would've sensed it. My nose isn't as sharp now, but I can tell that much.

Chie Satonaka: But they found the body on a foggy day again, right? They said on the news that the crime scene was just the way it was for that announcer and Saki-senpai.

Yukiko Amagi: I really wonder about the culprit's motives… Why was Mr. Morooka targeted?

Kanji Tatsumi: Hope it wasn't personal, 'cause there's way too many people who hated King Moron's guts.

Rise Kujikawa: But didn't you say it's people who get famous on TV who are targeted? If the killer's choosing targets by watching TV, I picture him as someone who doesn't know the victims at all. I don't think it's worth trying to figure out motives for that type. There are too many people who hold grudges against you for no reason, even if you've never met them before.

Chie Satonaka: Haha… You sound like you speak from experience, Rise-chan… But with King Moron, he didn't appear on the Midnight Channel or the regular TV…

Kanji Tatsumi: Man, two victims in a row from our school… That's gotta set off the police's alarm bells. They're not gonna leave any stones at school unturned.

Yosuke Hanamura: Y'know, to be honest… Somewhere deep inside, I thought maybe King Moron was the killer… The news says that he was the second victim from Yasogami High, but we all know that's not the case. And I've heard him say more than once that so-and-so deserves to die… But now… I feel bad that I doubted him. He was a capital-A asshole, but that doesn't justify killing him… And not just King Moron… I feel sorry for all the victims… I can't forgive the killer, no matter what!

Chie Satonaka: Well, we'll do what we can, for King Moron's sake too! At this rate, you have to figure that the killer has something to do with the school, right? So why don't we split up and--

Familiar-sounding voice: That won't be necessary.

Kanji Tatsumi: Y-You…

Naoto Shirogane: There is no need to examine the case of Mr. Morooka any further.

Chie Satonaka: Wh-Why's that?

Naoto Shirogane: Apparently, the police have found a suspect. It would be best to let them handle the case from here.

Yosuke Hanamura: H-How do you know…?

Naoto Shirogane: I'm on this case as a special investigator, by request of the prefectural police.

Yosuke Hanamura: What!?

Chie Satonaka: They found a suspect…!? Who is it!?

Naoto Shirogane: As to his name, I haven't been informed. I do know… that he is a high schooler. It isn't public knowledge yet, but he isn't a student of your high school. It seems they are quite confident that this boy is the killer… They have testimonies directly linking him with the incident. I expect it's only a matter of time before he is apprehended. Soon, this case will be solved, and your town will once again be its peaceful, rustic self.

Yosuke Hanamura: The suspect… is a high schooler…? All right… So why come tell us? That's confidential info, right? Why run right here and spill it? Your ”game” will soon reach its end. I felt I should at least let you know that.

”It's not a game to us.”
”Just as long as it ends.” ✓
”Thanks for the notice.”

Naoto Shirogane: You don't deny, then, that you have involved yourselves in the matter? Well, no matter. I have no reason to say anything further.

Rise Kujikawa: A game…? Aren't you the one who thinks of this as a game?

Naoto Shirogane: ……!?

Rise Kujikawa: I don't care if you're a special investigator or an amateur sleuth… All you're doing is solving mysteries. What could you possibly know about us? You're the one who's playing a game here.

Yosuke Hanamura: One of the victims… She meant a lot to me. How could I possibly treat this like a game? Plus… We made a promise…

Teddie: Y-Y-Yosuke…

Naoto Shirogane: A game… That may be quite true…

Chie Satonaka: Wh-Why so understanding all of a sudden…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, I get it. I was wondering why you'd be wandering around like this when the police have a suspect… What, did they get rid of you now that they have their man? Is that why you came here? You were lonely?

Naoto Shirogane: Detectives normally aren't involved with arrests. And we never harbor any special emotions regarding a case, either. Still… It is rather unfortunate that people are only attentive so long as our services are required… But then, I'm accustomed to it.

Kanji Tatsumi: ……

Naoto Shirogane: Much about this case was perplexing, but its solution was surprisingly simple… Well then, I'll be going now.

Chie Satonaka: What was that about…? He just said his piece and left…? ……He said they have a suspect… but is this really gonna solve everything?

Yosuke Hanamura: *sigh* Who knows…

[Evening.]

Nanako Dojima: Welcome back!

> …You all decided to call it a day.

July 12th, 2011. Tuesday.
[It's raining outside. On your way to school you notice two students talking.]

> You overhear students talking.

Depressed girl: Finals start next week. *siiiiiiiiiigh*

Easygoing boy: Senpai, you look pretty down. That's not good for you, y'know? Once they're over, summer vacation isn't far behind, right?

Depressed girl: Shut it, puny underclassman! I have to study for my college entrance exams! Once you're a third-year student, you'll get a taste of what it's like to take tests all year. *sigh*

[You enter the classroom. The lesson begins.]

Ms. Kashiwagi: Remember guys, the finals are starting next week. If you fail, you'll have to attend our lovely summer school. Anyway, today, we're going to talk about sex linkage. Sex linkage inheritance is dependent on allosomes. To say it simply, it's genetic inheritance that's caused by whatever decides if you're male or female. An example is calico cats. Calico cats are almost entirely female. Not that there aren't any boys, but apparently there's only one out of every several tens of thousands. Maybe these rare male calicos are very popular with the ladies? Hehehe.

> You listen to the lecture intently…

> Your Knowledge has increased.

[After school.]

> Classes have ended for today.

> The suspect has been added to the wanted list…

> Who is the criminal…? You have no choice but to wait until more progress is made in the investigation…

[You approach Yukiko standing in the hallway.]

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, Yu-kun. How are your studies going? Why don't we study together?

Study together ✓
Don't study together

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, thank goodness. There were a few things I needed some help with.

> Yasogami High, Library…

> You studied with Yukiko.

Yukiko Amagi: Since we're here together, why don't I help you with the subjects you have trouble with and vice versa? Would you like to go first, Yu-kun?

> You were able to get more studying done by teaming up with Yukiko.

> Your Knowledge has greatly increased.

> You bonded with your study partner by studying together…

> Since you had completely read ”Expert Study Methods,” you were able to study more efficiently.

> Your Knowledge has increased.

> You feel that your relationship is going to become closer soon…

[Evening.]

Nanako Dojima: Welcome home, big bro. I went shopping today. The fridge is full of food.

> You recalled that exams start on Tuesday, next week.

> Study…?

[However, instead of studying, you decide to take a walk down the street. You meet Adachi at the bus stop.]

Tohru Adachi: Oh, it's you. You seem bored. Are you studying? Students need to study. Want me to tutor you?

> Adachi seems to be on his way home from work…

> Since you have Gurr, a Persona of the Jester Arcana, you two might get along well…

> You feel your relationship with Adachi is going to become closer soon…

> Will you have Adachi tutor you?

Tohru Adachi: Did that completely fly over your head? I forgot everything I learned in high school. Oh… But you did invite me over for dinner that one time. Fine, but just today, alright?

> You headed to the Dojima residence with Adachi…

> Dojima Residence, living room…

Tohru Adachi: You guys studying? Wait, no, I don't even want to look at yours. Too complicated- looking. Though maybe I could help with Nanako-chan's.

Nanako Dojima: Really!? You would? I have some homework! A book review!

Tohru Adachi: Oh, those. They're really easy if you know what to do. You don't have to read the whole thing. Just read the notes in the back and then summarize those.

Nanako Dojima: I don't? But my teacher said, read it, and write what you think.

Tohru Adachi: Don't worry about that. We have to be efficient here.

”You're right.” ✓
”She won't learn anything that way.”
”Is that how you do your job, too?”

Tohru Adachi: Haha, are you the same way? What a bad older brother!

> Adachi is laughing heartily.

Nanako Dojima: Big bro! Are you a punk!?

Tohru Adachi: Come on, Nanako-chan. Bring your book.

Nanako Dojima: It wasn't a review!

Nanako Dojima: I just have to read it. And then get a mark from a grown-up saying I did.

Tohru Adachi: Oh, okay. That's easy enough. Though… a mark? Dojima-san's going to be late today.

Nanako Dojima: Will you give me one, Adachi-san?

Tohru Adachi: Me? Okay. If you're good, I'll draw you a big flower.

Nanako Dojima: I want one!

Tohru Adachi: Alright, then get started.

Nanako Dojima: Once, in a deep, deep forest, Near a small, small river, There lived a pink alligator…

> Nanako is reading intently…

Nanako Dojima: …And so no one remembered the pink alligator. Even today, the lake is shining the way it always did. The end.

Tohru Adachi: Hmm…? Oh, you're done?

Nanako Dojima: Do I get a big flower?

Tohru Adachi: Yeah, sure, I'll give you one.

Nanako Dojima: Yaaay! A flower!

Tohru Adachi: What about you? Don't you have anything you want me to draw a flower on?

”Nope, nothing.” ✓
”I don't want one.”

Tohru Adachi: You're no fun… Are you really related to Nanako-chan? Never mind… You look mature, but you're still in high school, you know. I'm not saying it should be me, but if something happens, you shouldn't hesitate to bring it to a grown-up.

> You can tell that Adachi worries about you…

> You feel like you know Adachi a bit more…

> The Tohru Adachi Social Link has reached level 5!

> Your power to create Personas of the Jester Arcana has grown!

Tohru Adachi: Man, I'm tired. Mind if I take a little nap? That old lady brought me some photos of potential matches. She kept insisting I see these girls because they're ”nice,” and I had to do overtime because of it. Like I'll ever get married.

Nanako Dojima: You don't want to get married?

Tohru Adachi: Marriage is where fun goes to die. You'll understand in about twenty years, Nanako-chan. Come to think of it, Dojima-san will be father-in-law to whoever Nanako-chan decides to marry. Eeesh. That's certainly going to put a damper on her chances.

”What do you mean?” ✓
”You take that back!”

Tohru Adachi: There's just no way. Sorry, Nanako-chan.

Nanako Dojima: I don't want to get married, either! I don't like people with holes in their socks!

Tohru Adachi: I don't have holes in my socks!

Nanako Dojima: You did! The other day!

> The three of you spent an enjoyable evening together…

July 13th, 2011. Wednesday.
[You are walking to school with an umbrella in your hands. Yukiko runs up to you.]

Yukiko Amagi: Sorry! It's an emergency!

> Yukiko forced herself under your umbrella…

Yukiko Amagi: Whew… Thank you, I couldn't find my folding umbrella. It's odd, because I always have one in my bag. Oh, did I use it when I was with Chie…? Oh… S-Sorry! I didn't mean to intrude. ……Now I'm a little nervous… What if people start to talk…?

”That's fine with me.” ✓
”It won't happen.”
”Give it nine days.”

Yukiko Amagi: Huh…? R-Really? If it's all right with you, I guess it's fine with me too… Just kidding. …I hope it stops raining by the time school gets out.

[You go to school. P.E. class begins.]

Mr. Kondo: *sigh* You all seem really sad. I know, it's tough. …I still can't believe Mr. Morooka was taken from us. The faculty office is still in shock too… But we can't sob about it all day! Today we're gonna put the ”physical” back in education! We're gonna play rugby! And don't even think about getting lazy because it's hot! It's hot! It's hot, but run! Keep running! Sweat! And then, eat shaved ice! Because the shaved ice you eat after exercise is the best! Brainfreeze, aww yeah! Hahaha! You seem to be cool, Yu! Answer me, while running! What is the medical term for brainfreeze?

”Intercranial hypothermitis.”
”Neurocapillary constriction.”
”Sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia.” ✓
”Trigeminal nociception.”

> You gave the answer you thought was right…

Mr. Kondo: Yes! Fantastic! It's ”sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia”! When you eat something cold, like shaved ice, it constricts the flesh around the trigeminal nerve! That's the nerve that tells your brain that your forehead hurts, and so you think your forehead hurts! All right! I can see you're all sweating hard! The more you sweat, the better the shaved ice will be when you're done!

> You answered correctly…

> Your Knowledge has increased!

[After school.]

> Classes have ended for today.

> You have no choice but to wait until more progress is made in the investigation…

[You decide to go to the temple.]

> This is the shrine's main building. What will you do?

Nothing

> You made sure there was no one around and called for the fox…

> The fox brought you an ema with a wish written on it.

> It's written in large, uneven letters, probably by a child…

Ema: God, please give me some friends. Yoshitaka.

> It seems the fox wants you to fulfill the wish written on the ema on its behalf.

> Could it be thinking that if wishes are fulfilled, then more money will be put into the offertory box?

> If you fulfill the wish on the ema, your relationship with the fox may grow stronger. …Accept the request?

Yes ✓
No

> Accepted Quest 10: ”I Wish I Had Friends”

Fox: *yip*

> The fox seems happy.

[You head to the river and approach the boy standing by the map.]

Boy: Wh-What? I don't have any money.

”I don't want your money.” ✓
”Oh, then never mind.”

Boy: You're not here for anything else, then, right? I don't have any friends. So nobody ever wants to talk to me…

> The boy seems sad…

> He said he doesn't have any friends.

> Perhaps he's the one who wrote the ema request the fox showed you.

Lonely boy: Everyone talks about things I don't know about. Right now, they're all collecting stickers… I have a sticker, too, but they all said ”Everyone has that one…” If I had a rare sticker, I bet they'd become my friends…

> The boy wants a rare sticker so he can make friends.

Lonely boy: Huh…? Mister, is that a sticker?

> The boy noticed the Prize Sticker.

Lonely boy: ”Granter of your desires”? If this sticker can do that, then I'm sure to make friends! Mister, can you give me this sticker?

Give it to him ✓
Don't give it to him

Lonely boy: Yay! Thank you! I'm sure to have lots of friends now!

> The boy ran off cheerfully.

> Will he make lots of friends…? You should ask him another time.

[You go back to school and find Yukiko in the hallway.]

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, hi Yu-kun.

> It seems Yukiko isn't busy right now…

> Since you have High Pixie, a Persona of the Priestess Arcana, you feel you could be closer…

> You feel your relationship with Yukiko is going to become closer soon…

Yukiko Amagi: Okay.

Yukiko Amagi: Uh… Umm. Do you remember Kasai-san, the waitress? She seems to have told everyone about you… Now, they're saying I sh-should bring you home… Adults are so quick to poke fun at me… It's such a hassle, isn't it…? B-But of course my family runs an inn, so guests come by all the time… Maybe next time, you can just come in…

Middle-aged man: Oh, Yuki-chan!

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, the deputy mayor.

Deputy mayor: The people at the inn seemed very busy. Is something going on?

Yukiko Amagi: Huh…?

Yukiko Amagi: Oh no! Today was the interview for the travel show!

Deputy mayor: On TV? That's great! You'll try and make Inaba look inviting, won't you?

Yukiko Amagi: I'm sorry, I have to go.

”An interview?”
”You're going to be on TV?” ✓

Yukiko Amagi: No, I won't. We requested that no employees will be filmed or shown. It seems like a serious travel show, so everyone's eager to help. But they need me to help clean, so I have to go now.

> Yukiko looks apologetic…

Yukiko Amagi: Goodb--

Kasai: There you are, Yuki-chan!

Yukiko Amagi: Kasai-san? What's wrong?

Kasai: That TV crew came, but don't go to the inn! It was a trick! It's those people from that ”news of the weird” show! And I think they're looking for you! So stay put, you got that?

Yukiko Amagi: Huh… O-Okay, but…

Man's voice: There you are.

Shady reporter: No use in hiding, future manager of the cursed inn.

Yukiko Amagi: C-Cursed inn…?

Shady reporter: We know all about that murder case. Mayumi Yamano stayed at your place, right? And you guys've been hurting what with the drop in visitors, huh? So I came up with a great idea! ”The High-School Manager's Embarrassing Struggle: Renovating the Cursed Inn!” How's that grab you? The customers will be pouring in, I tell ya.

Yukiko Amagi: I don't understand what you…

Shady reporter: I want you to be the star. When we introduce the hot springs, let us film a little bathing scene, eh? ”The Modest Manager's Steamy Service!” Our ratings will be through the roof!

Young man: That sounds like a great idea!

Kasai: Listen, you…

Yukiko Amagi: Anyway, please leave. We are not interested in your coverage.

Shady reporter: You're refusing? *sigh* Look, kid… You don't know the power of television, do you? Well, I can't blame you, living in the countryside. We're trying to help you out here. I mean, do you WANT the patrons to dry up? If you're gonna be the next manager, I'm trusting you to make the right decision here.

Yukiko Amagi: I… won't be… the next manager.

Shady reporter: Oh, really? Hmmm… That so? Well, you just say the word, and I can hook you up with a better gig than running this dump of an inn. You could call yourself the ”Former High-School Innkeeper”… Heheheh, I'm already liking the sound of that! Why don't you hear me out?

Kasai: How dare you say that to Yuki-chan…!

Yukiko Amagi: …It's okay. Let him say what he wants. He'll go home once he gets it all out.

Shady reporter: What the shit…? You say your inn has been going for generations, but all that means is, it's crappy and run-down. Tradition is so last year. You'd be better off if you did close up shop. I've seen the stuff you serve… Small portions, decent service, nothing that stands out. If you want customers, you can't just do the same old, same old. You guys don't get that, and that's why you suck. Your waitresses don't even give any extra service unless you tip 'em, huh? Heyyyy… I know! Why don't you make all the waitresses young girls, and have 'em do all-day menus? Y'know, spread the futon out, then go straight in! But anyways, I was saying… Let's give your place a little TV-style publicity. Use your head, will ya?

Kasai: ……

Yukiko Amagi: …the hell up. Don't say another word about our inn! Who'd take your stupid ideas seriously!? From now on, we refuse ANY coverage from your station!

Shady reporter: You… bitch! If that's how you wanna play it, I'll plaster those words all over prime time! See how that feels!

Yukiko Amagi: Go ahead, by all means. And we'll respond with an official complaint to your sponsors.

Young man: Th-This isn't sounding good, sir.

Shady reporter: …Tch!

[The reporter and his team leave.]

Yukiko Amagi: I said some incredible things…

Kasai: …Haha.

Yukiko Amagi: Hahaha…

Kasai: Oh, I should contact the inn. I'll see you later!

Yukiko Amagi: I just… kind of lost it when he was insulting everyone. W-Was I scary?

”Yeah, you were.”
”You were cool.” ✓
”You should've said more.”

Yukiko Amagi: R-Really? Thank goodness… ……There was a time not long ago when I thought, ”It'd be better off if it closed,” but it's like my home… It's where everyone in my world is… I can't let it close…

Ryotaro Dojima: Hey, welcome back.

Sayoko Uehara: Nice work… Were you waiting here for me? Oh, you sweet thing. Well, then… Would you like to study with me? Perhaps a subject that they don't teach in school, if you catch my drift…?

”What do you mean?”
”I'm not interested.” ✓
”Please, by all means.”

Sayoko Uehara: Oho… You're an honest guy. That's cute, in boys your age.

> Sayoko smirks at you.

Sayoko Uehara: I don't find your type around here. The kids over here are much simpler. All they see is the carrot dangling in front of their faces… You're… I know. You seem to have some sort of secret deep inside you… …I think it's irresistible.

July 14th, 2011. Thursday.
[You are sitting in class at school.]

Mr. Hosoi: I'm sure you're all feeling anxious, knowing your homeroom teacher is deceased… Well, to be honest, us teachers are kind of afraid ourselves. The culprit is still on the loose. But there's no sense wasting time moaning about it. Let's get to work! Today, we'll talk about Kobo Daishi, or Kuukai. First, look at this kanji.

Li'l Hosoi: Hey, Hosoi-chan, isn't that a misprint in the textbook? It's supposed to be ”応”!

Mr. Hosoi: Haha, good eye, but no. This is the wrong kanji, but the book is supposed to print it this way. It's actually quoting… hmm? Yu-chan, quit staring at the puppet and pay attention to the book! Which famous Heian-era monk famously used a wrong version of the ”応” kanji?

”Kuukai.” ✓
”Saicho.”
”Genshin.”

Mr. Hosoi: Yep, that's right, it was Kuukai. You were listening after all. There's an old saying: ”Even Kobo made mistakes in writing.” Kobo is another name for Kuukai, and this was the mistake he made. This happened when he wrote the name ”Outenmon” on the frame of the Outen gates in the city of Kyo. But, it wasn't until after they put the frame up that he noticed that he missed the dot on top of the 応 character. Instead of taking the entire thing down to redo it, he added the dot by throwing his calligraphy brush at the gate. By the way, my wife made this doll for me by hand. Don't you think she did a great job making it look like me?

> You gave the correct answer…

> Your Knowledge has increased.

[After school.]

> Classes have ended for today.

> You have no choice but to wait until more progress is made in the investigation…

[You go to the river to visit the lonely boy.]

Lonely boy: Oh, you're the one who gave me the Prize Sticker… I showed it to them, but they said a grown-up sticker didn't count… Here, you can have it back… Where am I supposed to find a rare kid's sticker? I don't know any… 

> The boy is looking for a rare sticker that is popular among kids.

> Maybe you should ask some kids for ideas.

[You go to the mall and meet Adachi there.]

Tohru Adachi: Hm? Oh, it's you. You saved me. Want to talk? It'll look more like I'm investi--Err, forget that.

> It seems Adachi is slacking off…

> You feel that your relationship is going to become closer soon…

[Afternoon.]

Mr. Yamada: All right, that's the lesson about the Mariana Islands. Let's take a breather and talk about something fun! The Mariana Islands are in the area of the ocean where typhoons are born. There's a line on the map that typhoons can never cross. Let's see… Yu-kun, you've blended into this class a little too well. Which line can a typhoon never cross?

”The equator.” ✓
”The International Date Line.”
”The Prime Meridian.”

> You gave the answer you think is correct…

Mr. Yamada: Yes, that's correct. I'm surprised you knew that one. Typhoons are moved by global air currents called atmospheric circulation. If one forms in the northern hemisphere, it moves north. If it forms in the south, it moves south. That's why a typhoon can never cross the equator. Isn't that interesting? Make sure you tell your parents that I'm an interesting teacher, okay? Feedback like that affects my paycheck. Ahaha, just kidding! Let's continue the lesson!

> You gave the correct answer…

> Your Knowledge has increased.

[After school.]

Will you gave him the Tankiriman Sticker?

Don't give it to him

Lonely boy: A Tankiriman Sticker? Wow, thank you! This is cool-looking, so I'm sure they'll let me play after I show them this!

Takeshi: Ch-Chie!

Chie Satonaka: Oh, hey Takeshi… W-Were you robbed again?

Takeshi: No… I took off right after that, right? So I thought I'd apologize…

Chie Satonaka: …Why don't you be a man and admit you ran away?

Takeshi: Wh-What…? Were you this anal before? Tch, if you lose that sunny attitude, you won't have anything left.

Chie Satonaka: …Shut up!

Takeshi: Speaking of which… What's up with Yukiko-san? I saw her with you the other day… She seemed weirdly cheerful… She had this funky laugh, y'know…?

Chie Satonaka: That funky laugh… That's how she really is.

Takeshi: Oh, you've rubbed off on her, huh? I can't believe it… That's not Yukiko-san… She was better gloomy…

Chie Satonaka: …… …Look. If you get into trouble again, I'll step in and help.

Takeshi: …Huh? Oh, uh… Thanks…

Chie Satonaka: So why don't you shut your mouth about Yukiko!? You don't know anything about her! She's a good person, got it!?

Takeshi: Wh-What the hell?

[He leaves.]

Chie Satonaka: I just remembered… Way back, I saw Yukiko sitting by the road, holding a dog. I asked her what's up and she said she ran away from home… She'd picked up the dog, but her parents told her she couldn't have a pet, and that she'd have to get rid of it… She looked like she was dead or something… I tried everything I could think of to make her laugh. And that's how we became friends… From that moment on… I told myself I'd protect Yukiko… But… Somewhere along the way, I messed up, and that Shadow popped out… After that, I thought I'd try to focus on what's good about me. I swore to quit being nothing but the girl Yukiko can rely on… So… I just tried my best. At finding the culprit and stuff… just generally being more reliable… That's all. ……I feel like I missed the point…

”There's still time.”
”That's the first step.” ✓
”It's hard to face yourself.”

Chie Satonaka: …Thanks. You're too kind. Maybe… half a step?

> Chie is smiling happily.

Chie Satonaka: I wonder if there's anyone out there… who can say, ”This is what makes me worthwhile!” I guess everyone's looking for it…

> Chie was able to take a step forward and face herself.

> You feel your relationship with Chie has grown yet deeper…

> The Chie Satonaka Social Link has reached level 8!

> Your power to create Personas of the Chariot Arcana has grown!

> The old lady left…

> Who was she…?

> Inaba Municipal Hospital, empty hospital room…

> Sayoko found you and brought you here…

Sayoko Uehara: Well done. You could just slack off and do a half-assed job, but you really do work your cute little butt off, don't you? …So why are you working at a job like this?

”For the money.” ✓
”To be closer to you.”
”To have something to do.”

Sayoko Uehara: Hmmmm. You're a starving student? Then should you really be caught up here with a ”naughty” lady like me?

> Sayoko smiles mischievously…

Sayoko Uehara: But still, a young child shouldn't be wasting time wiping windows at the hospital… I'm sure there are girls who would cry if they saw you doing menial chores like this. Speaking of which… Say, do you have a girlfriend?

”I do.”
”I do not.”
”Right in front of me.” ✓
”Why do you ask?”

Sayoko Uehara: Me…? You should work on your pickup lines. You don't have an eye for the ladies.

> Sayoko seems to be embarrassed…

Sayoko Uehara: …High schoolers are so young. They're only ten years younger, but they seem so far away… It's like they're glittering… I feel this… what do you call it? Envy? Maybe that's why… …… …I just want to see them get screwed over by life. Oho, that was a joke, of course. Half of it was, anyway… …Do you see what I'm getting at?

”Oh, yes.”
”No…”
”Stop it!” ✓

Sayoko Uehara: Oho… I keep telling you, silly, that that's the kind of reaction I just find… irresistible…!

> Sayoko smirks at you…

Sayoko Uehara: I have to go now. I have a lot of work piling up. But I just can't help myself… It's because you're just so cute…

July 16th, 2011. Saturday.
[You walk up to the school. It is raining outside. Chie runs up to you.]

Chie Satonaka: Oh, Yu-kun, Morning. Hey, that guy the police are after… I wonder what he's like. How's the investigation going? I can't stop worrying about it. Speaking of worrying about things… We have tests coming up next week… *sigh* But I can't study when I'm thinking about our investigation!

”Focus!” ✓
”I don't study anyway.”

Chie Satonaka: Ugh… I guess you're right… how I am supposed to argue with that…?

[Morning.]

Ms. Sofue: …And that's our lesson on the Saxon Wars that Charlemagne brought about during the 8th and 9th centuries. Speaking of Charlemagne, the king of hearts in a deck of cards is supposedly modeled after him. The king of hearts has a characteristic that the other kings don't. I wonder if any of you knows what it is… Well, Yu. Please stand up. Tell me what makes the king of hearts look different from the other kings in a standard deck of cards.

”He has no mustache.” ✓
”He has an axe.”
”His mouth is open.”
”He's looking to the right.”

> You give the answer you think is correct…

Ms. Sofue: Hohoho… You notice the details, Yu. That's good. Yes, the king of hearts is the only one without a mustache. Back then, playing cards were made using the same methods as books, by etching and engraving. It's said a clerk's hand slipped… And the resulting mistake with his chisel shaved off the mustache! Since then, that design has become commonplace, and so the king of hearts is simply drawn without a mustache. Isn't this a great example of one small mistake making its way into history? You never know where those little doodles you make on your answer sheets will end up in the future.

> You gave the correct answer…

> Your Knowledge has increased.

[After school.]

> Classes have ended for today.

> You have no choice but to wait until more progress is made in the investigation…

> Junes, Food court…

Kou Ichijo: Check this out, Yu… I borrowed Daisuke's notes for those days I was absent. Here's the one he gave me, and right across the top, it says ”Aglebra 1…” Dude, how long has it been since we passed Algebra 1? And learn how to spell!

Daisuke Nagase: Hey, don't borrow notes if you're gonna complain about 'em.

Kou Ichijo: Fine, next time I'll know better… *sigh* I'm ready for the tests in every subject except math… …You any good at math, Yu?

”You can 'count' on me.”
”I'm allergic to math.” ✓

Kou Ichijo: You are too!? Maybe we were separated at birth! Here, you can have this, then. Hopefully it'll help you…

> Obtained Poly-land.

Daisuke Nagase: Forget math. I need major help with world history, physics, English…

Kou Ichijo: You're hopeless, Daisuke.

Chie Satonaka: Wow, hey you guys. Are you all going to study? Think we can tag along?

Kou Ichijo: Oh, really? For sure! The more the merrier!

Yukiko Amagi: Thank you so much.

Kou Ichijo: S-Sure, n-no problem…

Chie Satonaka: Ooooh, so you're one of those guys in the Yukiko fan club.

Kou Ichijo: Wh-Whaaat? N-No, it's not like that…

Chie Satonaka: Don't worry, I'll just ask Yu-kun to help me.

Daisuke Nagase: Yeah, me too.

Kou Ichijo: H-Hey, wait just a minute here!

[You pray together.]

Yukiko Amagi: I've decided not to leave Inaba. I never really objected to being the inn's manager per se… I just didn't like the fact that it wasn't up to me… I felt that my life was on rails. And I thought running away was the only choice for me… But no longer. I want to protect the family inn. After all, it's near to my heart… Um… Thank you. I think it's because of you that I realized this. Because you were always by my side…

Chie Satonaka: Yuck! Don't yawn in my face like that! Hey, for the third question on the English test, which phrase did you choose?

Yukiko Amagi: Um… I went with ”used to.”

Chie Satonaka: Wrong again…

Yosuke Hanamura: So much for Chie going abroad. Heck, why leave Inaba? You have so much right here!

Chie Satonaka: Ooooh, you're so annoying!

Kanji Tatsumi: Yo…

Rise Kujikawa: No more encores… I mean… Hi everyone…

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa, more losers!?

Rise Kujikawa: What do I need to know English for!? I can always ask for a translator! How did you do, Senpai?

”My pen was on fire.”
”Just you wait and see.” ✓
”I didn't get a single one…”

> You evaded the question in an adult-like manner.

> Your Expression has increased.

Rise Kujikawa: Whoa, are you that confident? Wait… confident about what again?

Kanji Tatsumi: Enough about the exams already… What's going on with the murder case?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hm… Why don't we head to our special headquarters? We haven't been there in a while.

> You decided to get together at the Junes food court.

Chie Satonaka: I'm kinda bummed… Not just because exams are over, but… The whole thing with the police finding a suspect. I mean, we believed that only we could solve this case. And now…

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, we still don't know yet. They haven't made an arrest.

Kanji Tatsumi: So… we gotta sit on our thumbs.

[Adachi, hanging around as usual, walks up to them.]

Tohru Adachi: For crying out loud… It's nice to have a suspect, but where the hell is he? We're at the end of our rope here… Y-You guys!? D-Did you hear what I said? Ah… Ahahaha! This case is as good as solved! Don't worry, kids. It's only a matter of time before we bring in the suspect. I mean, the guy's kidnapping people at random and slaughtering them! We won't rest until we bring him to justice! I-I gotta get going!

[He runs away.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Now I'm REALLY worried… On the other hand… If the police have a search warrant out for the guy, we should stay out of it.

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah…

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, uh, I just remembered. There was a question on the exam that I didn't get. I think it was, ”The chemical formula HCHO, used for silver mirror reactions. Its 40% solution is known as formalin.” And the question was, ”What is HCHO?”

”Formic acid.”
”Ascorbic acid.”
”Formaldehyde.” ✓

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, I see. I chose acetic acid… Duh, of course it couldn't have been vinegar. Hey, you had that question too, didn't you Kanji?

Kanji Tatsumi: Shut up. And don't call me by my first name.

Rise Kujikawa: Wow, kinda harsh, aren't you? I heard you got a nosebleed when you were around our senpai.

Kanji Tatsumi: H-Hey! Who the hell blabbed about that!?

Chie Satonaka: A-Anyways! Rise-chan, why don't you ask Yukiko to help you study?

Rise Kujikawa: Huh? I guess, but wouldn't you rather ask a senpai of the opposite sex? Senpai… I'm not a nuisance to you, am I?

Chie Satonaka: Damn… This girl's dangerous…! L-Let's change the subject. Hey, any idea how Teddie's doing?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention it to you. Check this out.

> It's Teddie…

[Teddy, in his bear costume, hands out balloons to the children. He waves to the others.]

Yosuke Hanamura: I let him stay at my place. In return, he's now our official store mascot.

Kanji Tatsumi: Aaah! So he's hiding in plain sight. Reverse psychology, huh? Man… He looks like one happy bear…

Yosuke Hanamura: He kept saying that he didn't wanna go back, so I made him a deal. Now, since I've got nothing better to do… I'm gonna go bug him.

Chie Satonaka: Oooh, I wanna go too!

Kanji Tatsumi: C-Can I… feel his soft fur…?

[They leave.]

Rise Kujikawa: Hey, Senpai? Now that I'm getting the hang of school, I want to go out more and see the sights. But I tend to get recognized everywhere I go, so I'm a little nervous about going out on my own… And you seem like the type of guy who knows all the cool spots in town. ……

”Sure, I'll show you around.” ✓
”If I have the time…”
”Yeah, I know a few places.”

Rise Kujikawa: Really? Woohoo!

> You sense Rise's natural, easy friendliness…

[Evening.]

[You and Nanako watch TV together over a cup of tea.]

Announcer: Tonight, we have a special report. The topic is the bizarre serial murder case in Inaba, where the victims' bodies are discovered hanging upside down. Police have yet to announce any progress in the investigation since the discovery of a third victim. Our special report tonight is a summary of the events and the facts in the case thus far…

> There seems to be no information about the suspect…

Nanako Dojima: They still haven't caught him?

”Don't worry.”
”They'll catch him soon.”
”I'll protect you.” ✓

Nanako Dojima: Okay. You promise, right?

Lonely boy: Oh, Mister! Y'know the sticker you gave me? Everyone already knew about it… But I did make friends! I talked to them every time I got a new sticker, and they just kinda became my friends! It's thanks to you! Oh, and also the fox. I wrote my wish at the shrine. They say a fox grants wishes there. I'll go say thanks to the fox later!

> You accomplished the request written on the ema!

”Why?”
”You don't eat out?”
”Just order takeout.” ✓

Rise Kujikawa: How little you know, Senpai! It's the atmosphere that's important. The meal itself isn't everything, you know.

> Rise's voice is swelling with pride for some reason.

Rise Kujikawa: To tell you the truth, I've wanted to do this since I was a child. My parents were actually pretty strict. I didn't really have many friends. Though I guess that couldn't be helped, since I hardly ever showed up for school. ……Er, that's enough talk about that! What a depressing subject, huh? Let's talk about something fun. After all, I don't want to waste the time we have together! It's so great that I came to this town and met you. Really, I'm serious!

Nanako Dojima: Welcome home, big bro.

July 25th, 2011. Monday.
[You are walking to school in the pouring rain. Yukiko runs up to you.]

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, good morning, Yu-kun. Hey, have you seen the weather report? This rain's going to lift in the afternoon, but they said it's going to rain all day tomorrow. Wouldn't it be a good idea to check the Midnight Channel… just in case? The culprit is already wanted by the police, but he's someone the police can't handle to begin with.

”Let's check it out.” ✓
”I trust the police.”

Yukiko Amagi: Yes. Let's let everyone else know too, okay?

[Lunchtime.]

Female student: Hey, everyone! They posted the test results!

Yosuke Hanamura: Argh… The awful moment of truth… Oh well. Wanna check it out?

> You decided to check the test results.

> You got the highest score!

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoooa! You're a genius, Yu! That's awesome! I'm just as happy as if I'd got the highest grade myself!

> Your Social Link friends seem to be looking at you admiringly…!

> You feel that you became closer to your school friends!

> Lunch break is almost over. You decided to return to class…

[After school.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Aaaaaah, we're finally free! Hey, why don't we go somewhere during summer vacation? My motorcycle's back from the shop.

Rise Kujikawa: Hey, you guys have motorcycles!? Lucky you!

Kanji Tatsumi: Your scooter's fixed!? I'm surprised they got it back together after… Hanako-senpai, was it?

Chie Satonaka: Did something happen with Yosuke and Hanako-san?

Kanji Tatsumi: He was strikin' out with the ladies and got his scooter busted up.

Chie Satonaka: Whoa! Yosuke's after Hanako-san!?

Yukiko Amagi: I-I'll back you up!

Yosuke Hanamura: I wasn't talking about anything like that! I was saying we should go somewhere over summer vacation, like the beach. It'd be a pain to go by train, but a motorcycle…!

Yukiko Amagi: Hm, I haven't been to the beach in a long time either…

Chie Satonaka: The bright sun, the glistening waves, that luscious scent drifting from nearby stands, the dripping of meat juices…

Yosuke Hanamura: Is food all you can think about…?

Rise Kujikawa: Hey, why don't we get our licenses too? It's just a written test, right?

Kanji Tatsumi: We can't. We're too young.

Rise Kujikawa: Aww, sorry Kanji! But my birthday was last month, so I'm sixteen now.

Kanji Tatsumi: Hey, that's cheating!

Rise Kujikawa: Ohh, but sitting behind Senpai sounds great too. I wanna squeeze in close!

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, yeah… Let me remind you that it's against the law to have two people ride on a motorcycle. But I think it's a good idea for you guys to get your licenses. It only takes about a week.

Yukiko Amagi: It's supposed to be for work, but there's a scooter at the inn!

Rise Kujikawa: We got one as a gift at the office that's just sitting around. I bet I could borrow it if I asked! …I'd have to call my manager, though.

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh. Is this actually working out…? How about you, Chie?

Chie Satonaka: A scooter, huh?

Yosuke Hanamura: It can be any kind as long as it's lower than 50cc.

Chie Satonaka: Then I might be in luck… One of our relatives loves motorcycles! Maybe he has a scooter I can borrow.

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa… This might really happen! Let's all get our licenses and hit the beach together!

Kanji Tatsumi: Hold up. What about Teddie?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hmm. If he doesn't move around, he could pass as luggage.

Kanji Tatsumi: That's stretchin' it a little…

Yosuke Hanamura: It'll be fine. If we can't get him on with one of us, we'll just strap on some wheels and tow him.

Yukiko Amagi: *snrk* Heehee…

Chie Satonaka: Wh-What's so funny?

Yukiko Amagi: Teddie… on wheels… Heehee… Rollerskates…! Ahaha… It's perfect!

Rise Kujikawa: I've made up my mind. I'm gonna get my license! The beach, huh…? I've gone before for pinup shoots, but it's been a while since I went for fun!

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh my gosh… Does this mean… I'll get to see Risette herself in a swimsuit with my own two eyes!?

Chie Satonaka: Can you maybe not talk about her like she's not here!?

Rise Kujikawa: Hey, who are you looking forward to seeing in a swimsuit, Senpai?

”You, of course.”
”I can't wait to see Chie.” ✓
”I'm looking forward to Yukiko.”
”Kanji, no question.”

Chie Satonaka: M-Me!? Wow, no pressure, huh! Though I admit… I am kinda proud to hear that.

> Chie is embarrassed…

Yosuke Hanamura: Anyway, looks like we're set on going to the beach. Yukiko, Chie, you guys should get your licenses too. Then you can ride motorcycles with us.

Chie Satonaka: Well then, let's do this!

Rise Kujikawa: Yeah!

Yukiko Amagi: Huh? O-Oh, yeah!

> It seems you'll be going to the beach with everyone.

> Classes have ended for today.

Naoki Konishi: …Then Masaya made up an excuse for why he was late, and he said, ”The wind was really strong.” The teacher got really pissed. ”Shut your eyes, all of you!” he yelled, and started scolding us… But no one knew why we had to close our eyes, so it was really awkward… After scolding us, he starts class and he yells out, ”Who wants to answer? I know! Masaya, answer the question!” And Masaya says, ”I can't see the board with my eyes closed.” The teacher lost it right there, and the class became a free period.

Loud-Mouthed Housewife: Konishi-san's son, right?

Naoki Konishi: ……

Passing housewife: Their daughter was killed.

Loud-Mouthed Housewife: Poor thing.

Passing housewife: A psychic on TV said that their ancestors committed some sin…

Loud-Mouthed Housewife: I heard their store faces the northeast, and that's what's bringing in all the bad luck.

Passing housewife: But that boy looked cheerful. You'd figure he would be sad. That's pretty cold of him.

Loud-Mouthed Housewife: Siblings close in age aren't that friendly to each other. My son and daughter are…

Naoki Konishi: ……

”I'll go tell them off.”
”You're not saying anything?”
”Let the gossipers gossip.” ✓

Naoki Konishi: You're right… Why do I care about what random people think? I know someone understands me, and that's enough.

> It looks like Naoki cheered up a bit.

Naoki Konishi: Those ”roving eyes” are always around somewhere… I'm used to it, though… It seems they're not satisfied unless I look like a victim. That's why it's been so long since I've talked to anyone about stupid things and just laughed… It's fun.

[Evening.]

Nanako Dojima: Welcome back!

CHAPTER 41: Try And Catch Me
July 26th, 2011. Tuesday.
[On the way to school…]

> You overhear students talking.

Guy with a backpack: Summer vacation starts TOMORROW! Woohoo!

Bespectacled student: Too bad it's raining. The forecast said that it was going to last until evening… Well, it'll let up by tomorrow morning. I wonder if we'll have a nice, clear summer sky tomorrow.

Guy with a backpack: Oh, well… It's not like I had any plans or anything. I guess I could watch ”Tanaka's Amazing Commodities” and see if there's anything I want. I don't know what it is about that show, but I always end up buying something. It's that one that goes: ”Over the airwaves to yoooouuuu!” Have you seen it…?

[Morning.]

Ms. Kashiwagi: All right, I understand that you're all excited about the vacation, but we're having the end-of-term assembly in the gym now. I won't say anything mean like SOMEONE I know, but please do what you're told. *giggle* I'm excited about summer vacation too! I already bought my swimsuit. Not that it's got that much material to call it a swimsuit… Hmhmhm. Well, enjoy your summer vacation, everyone. Oh, and don't forget to do your homework, okay?

> The closing ceremony has ended. The first term ends today.

> You have no choice but to wait until more progress is made in the investigation…

[You go out into the school hallway and notice Yumi who seems upset about something.]

Yumi: Ozawa: Oh, Yu-kun… Oh, right, it's a practice day today… Are you going?

> Since you have Cu Sith, a Persona of the Sun Arcana, you two might get along well…

> You feel your relationship with Yumi is going to become closer soon…

> Will you spend the afternoon at drama club practice?

Yumi Ozawa: I see… You're working hard, huh?

> Yumi smiles weakly…

Yumi Ozawa: I'm sorry, but you should go to practice… by yourself. I have to go somewhere… … I'll drop by if I can make it.

> Yasogami High drama club…

> You participated in the acting exercises.

> You thoroughly practiced expressing a variety of emotions…

> Your Expression has increased.

> Yumi isn't here…

> You decided to stop by the hospital again.

> Inaba Municipal Hospital hallway…

> Yumi is standing at the door…

Yumi Ozawa: Yu-kun… …I just came from Dad's--that man's room…

”Did you make up with him?”
”Are you taking care of him?”
”How is your mom?” ✓

Yumi Ozawa: It was nothing. She's already out of the hospital…

> Yumi smiles, relieved.

Yumi Ozawa: I was here anyway… I came here to pick up some medicine for Mom. I just decided to stop by. He looked at me, and he smiled like he was so happy… Do you want to watch TV?” ”If you want to read some manga, go ahead and buy some.” ”Here's some money for ice cream.” ……He's so stupid… Getting all excited… Coughing… Causing trouble for the doctors… He's so stupid… That man is not my father. I keep telling myself that over and over, and yet… I can't take it anymore… Why me… Why me, why me!?

Nurse: Excuse me, can you keep your voice down, please?

Yumi Ozawa: Oh… I'm sorry… I'm sorry… I just lost control for a moment… …Why do I have to go through all of this? Why me!?

”It's just bad luck.”
”It's your fault.”
”You're not the only one.” ✓

Yumi Ozawa: So what if it's not just me? …No one can understand what I'm going through!

> Yumi yells at you with tears in her eyes.

Yumi Ozawa: Oh… I have to go. I need to get this medicine to my mom. Um… I'm glad you came.

> It seems you were able to give Yumi some emotional support.

> You feel that your relationship with Yumi has deepened…

> The Yumi Ozawa Social Link has reached level 6!

> Your power to create Personas of the Sun Arcana has grown!

Yumi Ozawa: …I'll see you at school.

> You watched Yumi walk off sadly.

[Evening.]

Nanako Dojima: Welcome home, big bro.

> It's been a while since it's rained through the night like this.

> You should check out the Midnight Channel…

Watch TV in your room ✓
Not just yet

[You go upstairs to your room.]

> It's raining tonight…

> Something may appear on TV…

> …Someone appeared!

> It's an extremely vivid image!

> A boy is standing with his back against a wall…

Boy on screen: ……You all think you can see me? You all think you know everything about me? ……Then try and catch me.

> Who was that…?

[Your phone starts ringing.]

> It's from Yosuke.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, did you see that!? Who was that guy? I don't know him… Have you ever seen him on the news or some television special? He seemed really gloomy… Like a zombie…

Teddie: Yosuke! Yooosukeeee!

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright already, I hear you! Sorry, I'm gonna give the phone to Ted.

Teddie: Sensei! It's me, Teddie! I finally got to see the Midnight Channel with my own eyes. Now I know exactly what's happening. That guy's suppressed emotions are resonating with the other side, which are picked up by the TVs over here. It's clear now that it's not being filmed by anyone. Mystery solved! But that kid… He must already be inside the other world! What're we gonna do!?

”We're going in.” ✓
”We need a plan first.”

Teddie: Gotcha! I knew I could count on you, Sensei!

> You can sense Teddie's strong trust in you…

Teddie: I think my heart skipped a bit…

> The Teddie Social Link has reached level 3!

> Your power to create Personas of the Star Arcana has grown!

> Teddie's determination in battle has been enhanced…

> Teddie can now perform a follow-up attack during battle!

Yosuke Hanamura: That's enough, Ted! Gimme the phone! Hey, how could he be already inside!? What happened to the blurry image that we usually see in advance? And did you hear what he said? ”Try and catch me”… ……Now that I think about it, he looked like a high schooler… Hey, could he be…? Nah, I better not jump to conclusions. Let's meet up at headquarters tomorrow. Alright, later!

[As soon as he hangs up, you get another call.]

> It's Chie.

Chie Satonaka: Oh, I finally got through! Yosuke's line was busy, too… I was just talking to Yukiko! Was that…?

> You recapped your conversation with Yosuke and Teddie for her.

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, we gotta get to the bottom of this. Well, we better get some rest. Good night.

> …You decided to go to bed early.

July 27th, 2011. Wednesday.
> It's summer break starting today.

> You promised to meet up with your friends at the food court…

> You should hurry over to the food court.

Yosuke Hanamura: Okay, Rise and Teddie are checking out the other side, so we'll go ahead and start the meeting. Now, about what happened last night… You guys all saw it, right?

[Chie and Kanji nods.]

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah. Shit he said made my blood boil. That mumbling of his and those fish-like eyes pissed me off even more. Who the hell is he?

”A victim.”
”The killer.”
”I don't know.” ✓

Yosuke Hanamura: Hmm… Truth to tell, I get the feeling I've seen him before…

Yukiko Amagi: I was surprised when I saw how clearly his face showed on TV. So I called Chie, and while we were talking, it hit me… Maybe that boy is the culprit.

Chie Satonaka: It's just a hunch, but it makes sense.

Yosuke Hanamura: We've been told the suspect is a high schooler… The police are after him for the murder of King Moron. So to see that on TV last night, at a time like this…

Yosuke Hanamura: I mean, he even taunted the viewers, saying ”Try and catch me”…

Kanji Tatsumi: Uhhhh… So?

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright, let's say there's this high school student. We'll call him Shin. For some random reason, who knows why, Shin is able to enter the other world. Then Shin, again for some random reason, starts throwing people into that world, intending to kill them. The police can't prove the other world exists, so it's the perfect crime. He can't possibly be caught. Now imagine you're Shin, but after a while, people stop dying when you throw them in the TV. You don't know why. You want to kill King Moron, but the TV is out, so you have to do it personally. Now the police are on to you. As a result, you--I mean Shin--is a wanted criminal, and there's no place for him to run.

Kanji Tatsumi: So… you're saying he went into the other world to dodge the cops? Ohhhh… So that's why he said, ”Catch me if you can…” Wow Senpai, you're smarter than you look!

Yosuke Hanamura: Geez, you can piss me off sometimes.

Yukiko Amagi: We still don't know why he targeted people who were shown on TV… But if he had a personal grudge against Mr. Morooka, that explains one thing. With a strong enough motive, wouldn't he forsake the untraceable TV method and try to kill Mr. Morooka on his own? If you think about it that way, it sort of makes sense why Mr. Morooka died without appearing on TV. But I wonder what that boy's going to do, now that he's in there… With Teddie on this side, there's no way for him to get out…

Chie Satonaka: Y-You don't think… he's gonna get desperate and end it all…? He did look depressed, like it was the end of the world…

Yosuke Hanamura: No, I don't think that's it. The killer has to know that the people he threw into the TV have come back to this side. I can see missing Yukiko or Kanji. ButRise, a celebrity… There's no way the killer wouldn't know she's still alive. So that means he knows there's a way out of the TV world. As for the rest… We'll just have to ask him face to face.

[Rise runs up to them.]

Chie Satonaka: Hey, good timing! How'd it go?

Rise Kujikawa: Not good. There's not enough information to go on. But at least we're positive that someone's in there…

Yosuke Hanamura: I see… Wait, where's Teddie?

Rise Kujikawa: He's still looking.

Yosuke Hanamura: Alright. So we need to find out who that guy is… …And if he is, in fact, the one the police are after. Once we figure that out, we just do our thing.

Chie Satonaka: That's right! If he really is the killer and he's escaped into the other world, the police don't have a chance of catching him.

Kanji Tatsumi: So it's all on us!

> The Investigation Team Social Link has reached level 7!

> Your power to create Personas of the Fool Arcana has grown!

Chie Satonaka: Well then, let's get digging!

> It seems you'll need more information on that boy to make any progress.

> You should ask around about him…

[You inquire about the TV boy all over town without much result, until you stumble upon Kanji on the riverbank.]

Kanji Tatsumi: Mmm… Info on the suspect… It's pretty tough… Seems like no one knows anything, huh? But instead of bitchin' about it, why don't we go right to the source? Just ask Dojima-san. He's your uncle, right? He'd tell you something.

> Maybe Kanji's suggestion is right…

> But you wonder if Dojima will say anything…

[You find your uncle at a bus stop in the shopping district…]

Ryotaro Dojima: A clue to the criminal investigation? You… I told you not to stick your neck into things! There's no way I'd tell you! Geez… Damn, where did that Adachi go off to…?

> You can't seem to get anything out of him…

[You decide to visit the fox…]

> This is the shrine's main building.

> You should report to the fox about making the wish on the ema come true…

> You made sure there was no one around and called for the fox…

> Your Courage has increased.

> Your Courage has changed from Brave to Daring!

> The old lady in mourning garb is standing there again…

Old lady in black: Good evening… I'm sorry about what happened last time, when I was staring at your face. You just… You looked like someone I knew.

> The old woman smiles gently…

Old lady in black: Do you work here?

”Only part-time…” ✓
”I'm a high school student.”

Old lady in black: My, is that so. That's wonderful… I have a granddaughter about your age… She went back home today, though… Thinking about it… Meeting you here is a wonder… But I won't be coming back here anymore…

”What were you here for?”
”Why are you wearing black?” 
”We should meet again.” ✓

Old lady in black: Haha… This isn't a big town; we might run into each other eventually. I like to take in the sun at the riverbank when I have days off. The river sparkles so beautifully… It all feels so good, it saddens me. Haha, I'll be going now.

> The old woman left…

Sayoko Uehara: Oh, here you are. Talk about timing! That room over there needs some work done in it. Perhaps you could…? …Oh, whatever, just get in there. Okay, everything's back in order. The patient who had been in this room left just a little while ago. I want you to mop the floor. …Don't ask what happened here.

”…Okay.”
”I'd rather not know.” ✓
”…I can't stay in here.”

Sayoko Uehara: Oho, I was just kidding. The patient who was here was released today. He returned right from the brink of death!

> Sayoko smiles mischievously…

Sayoko Uehara: He was a good patient, who always listened to what I said. Plus, he was the president of his company at a young age. He was handsome, didn't complain, and independent. He wanted to get back to his work… Desperately. And, thanks to his perseverance, he was able to leave even earlier than we had scheduled to release him. ”Thank you for caring for me,” he said, bowing to me so happily… Then he turned around and walked out. He said such stupid things, like that he loved me. …Everyone leaves. They only need me when they're my patients… In the end, they all leave me.

”That's just how it is.”
”It's good they get better.” ✓
”Why don't you switch jobs?”

Sayoko Uehara: …This is exactly why I don't like kids. They try to win arguments.

> You seem to have put Sayoko in a bad mood…

Sayoko Uehara: …I must not have been making sense. Forget about what I was saying. I'll ask another janitor to handle this room. You go on home. The streets are dark… You shouldn't be here. You wouldn't want to get caught… by me.

> Sayoko gives you a faint smile…

[You go to Junes.]

Tohru Adachi: *sigh* I think I'll stay here a little longer before I go out again… Mm? Aaah! You startled me… Don't sneak up on me like that…! Eh? What was doing? Oh, uh, you know… Investigating…

”I'll tell Dojima.” ✓
”You're a hard worker.”

Tohru Adachi: D-Did Dojima-san maybe say anything about it? Just keep this a secret from him… Please! …Wait, what? Clues to catch the suspect? If I tell you, will you keep quiet!? Okay then… I'm just talking to myself here, but… He supposedly had a part-time job in the shopping district. Where was it? Oh… I don't think they told me that much.

> It seems that Adachi has purposely leaked some information.

> Where exactly did the suspicious boy work…?

> Leave Junes?

Yes ✓
No

[You decide to ask about the guy you see on the Midnight Channel in the Shopping District.]

> It's Souzai Daigaku.

> You asked if a student was working here part-time.

Lady: Wh-Where'd you hear that from? I told him not to tell anyone… …Anyway. Yes, he did work here for a short time. But this was a while ago. I had him cutting the meat, but he got bored with the work very quickly. Hmm… I remember he had black eyes. And what else… …Oh yeah. He said the person who worked here before him was his classmate during middle school… I see that kid--his classmate--around here sometimes. Maybe you should talk to him when you see him. I don't know if you'll find him today, but he recently dyed his hair golden brown, so he should be easy to spot.

> You've obtained a lead about the boy.

> If you can find his golden brown haired classmate, you'll probably obtain information about the boy…

[You return home.]

[In search of the information about the guy from the Midnight Channel you stroll around the Shopping District…]

Student: Huh? You want to see my yearbook? Oh, are you looking for… him? You wanna see his picture? Heh heh, you do, don't you? Well, today's your lucky day, because me and my friend are going around showing it to everyone! Want a copy?

> Obtained the boy's picture.

> There is no doubt that the boy in the picture is the one you saw on the Midnight Channel…

[You see a photo of the same guy that wanted to ask Yukiko out two million years ago. There’s his name under the photo - 久保美津雄]

> A name is written below the picture…

> ”Mitsuo Kubo”…

> So this is the suspicious boy's name…

> Your Understanding has increased.

Eri Minami: Yuu-kun, I'm here. Let's go home.

Yuuta: Where do you want to eat dinner? We can go somewhere expensive if you want. …I'm not hungry. I'm gonna play more!

Eri Minami: …I'll come later next time. I even left in the middle of a show just to be on time… I'm getting fed up with this treatment. *sigh* I should have known better than to try. We're not related, so there's nothing I can do about it…

”So, Yuuta can't love you?” ✓
”So, you can't love Yuuta?”

Eri Minami: ……

> Eri is remaining silent…

Eri Minami: They say when a woman starts breast feeding, her maternal instincts awaken. …It's true, I saw it on television. So, my maternal instinct towards him is shut away, especially since I've only known him for six months. There's nothing I can do… Fate has determined that we will be forever distant. Speaking of fate, have you heard this? Your entire life is determined from before you were even born. We're just little robots following the program our creator made for us. So, whenever anything happens, there's nothing you can do about it… It was already decided for you. Doesn't that make you feel better? Isn't that a wonderful idea?

”You're right…” ✓
”It's a boring idea.” 
”It's not a good idea.”

Eri Minami: Amazing, isn't it? I saw it on TV. I was so intrigued, I went to see a lecture by that speaker, too. I was moved to tears… I was so relieved to know that there's a higher power!

> Eri's eyes are glittering…

Eri Minami: There really isn't much to do when you live this far away from the city… All I have is TV and the internet. You can buy things over the net now! It's much more convenient. In fact, I'm having trouble staying in shape. Honestly, though… I just want to go back to the city.

”Why don't you go back?” 
”Why don't you take Yuuta?” 
”Just let it go.” ✓

Eri Minami: Yeah… I gave up on that a long time ago.

> Eri is smiling wryly…

Eri Minami: …I really tell you a lot of personal things. Please, don't tell Yuu-kun… Or the other mothers.

”I won't.” 
”Why would I?” ✓

Eri Minami: …Thank you, Mister Yu.

> Eri looks relieved.

> You felt Eri opening up to you out of a deep loneliness…

> The Young Mother Social Link has reached level 4!

> Your power to create Personas of the Temperance Arcana has grown!

Eri Minami: …Oh my, look at the time! I'm sorry, Mister Yu. I'll take Yuu-kun home now.

> You decided to pretend not to notice and continue cleaning…

> Your Courage has increased.

Sayoko Uehara: Oh… You're here.

> Sayoko looks like she's in a bad mood…

Sayoko Uehara: …Did you hear that commotion? That was the first time anyone ever called me a ”slutty bitch” to my face…

”What happened? ”
”It's like a soap opera.” ✓

Sayoko Uehara: Seriously. When I laughed at her feeble attempt at an insult, she scratched at me. Who's the bitch now…?

> Sayoko smiles wryly…

Sayoko Uehara: At the previous hospital I worked at… I had a relationship with one of the doctors. But… He had a wife. She found out, I was forced to quit… Then I started working here. Not too long after, it seems he began flirting again, this time with a different nurse at the hospital. I don't know what happened, but I got dragged back into it. His wife came all the way here to bitch at me. *sigh* The other nurses were just watching, with these stupid smirks on their faces.

”That can't be helped.” ✓
”I wish I'd seen it.”

Sayoko Uehara: Haha… You're right. I'd probably do the same, in their place… Strangers are strangers…

> Sayoko smiles wryly…

Sayoko Uehara: *sigh* Everything's just a pain. It wasn't like this at first… when I first thought about becoming a nurse. What am I working for…? What am I living for…?

> It seems the fox wants you to fulfill the wish written on the ema on its behalf.

[You come out of the Temple and see a troubled young man standing outside a closed store.]

Haggard man: …Isn't this a great-looking shop? My grandfather started this shop… And I closed it down. Nowadays, kids don't make models… If they want toys, Junes has a much bigger selection. I can't compete. …A long while ago, kids used to come in here and show off the models they'd built, comparing to see who was best. The store was so lively. Ah, those were the days…

> The man sighed and stared off into the distance…

> Perhaps he's the one who wrote the ema request the fox showed you.

> He wants to find something to live for…

Despondent man: I feel sorry for the toys that still remain in the store… I want them to be completed, but it'd be even more pathetic if they had to be constructed by me. The models would be happier if a young kid like you made them…

> Maybe assembling one of these models will restore this man's will to live.

”Want me to make one?” ✓
”……”

Despondent man: Huh? W-Would you do that? Do you have model paint at your place? You need clippers? Do you use putty!? What about detail pens…?

> This man is clearly excited about the prospect of you building a model for him. Here, you can have this! Please show it to me when you're done!

> You obtained Unfinished Model.

> You can use the table in your room to put this together…

Eri Minami: Yuu-kun, let's go home, okay?

Yuuta: …I don't wanna go home yet! I'm playing with Mister!

Eri Minami: But doesn't that bother him?

Yuuta: No!

Eri Minami: Okay… fine. I'm going home.

Yuuta: ……

> Yuuta suddenly turned silent.

> You decided to play with Yuuta for a bit and then walk him home.

> On the way home, on the Samegawa flood plain…

> Eri is sitting over there…

Yuuta: …Is she mad at me?

”She's angry.”
”She's not angry.”
” Just apologize, Yuuta.” ✓

Yuuta: ……She hates me. But she has to take care of me… I feel sorry for her.

[Yuuta goes to Eri who sits on a bench alone.]

”She doesn't hate you.”
”Just give it time.” ✓
”Be a better kid, then.”

Yuuta: ……

Eri Minami: Oh… Thank you. You walked him here? …Maybe I should have you walk him all the way home. Ha ha… He looks so happy when he's at day care. Today he yelled, ”I don't wanna go home!” Well, obviously not. Haha… Even if he goes home, it's just the two of us. He'll forget his father's face at this rate. Poor thing…

> The two are unknowingly pitying each other…

> But it seems both are distancing themselves from the other.

Eri Minami: …I'm glad he's going to the day care center. He looks like he's having a good time, and I have time to myself, too. He seems happy even after he comes home, especially on the days you're there. …Of course, since we don't talk, I've never actually heard him say so. Please take care of him.

> You sense Eri's gratitude…

> You feel that your relationship with Eri has grown deeper…

> The Young Mother Social Link has reached level 5!

Old lady in black: My, is that so? If you're from the city, you may think it's a bit inconvenient here… But I think it's a nice town.

”I think so, too.” ✓
”Everyone says so, but…”

Old lady in black: Haha, that's nice to hear. It's good to hear pleasant things about your home. Oh, dear. I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself. My name is Hisano Kuroda. I am Death.

”Death?” ✓
”What do you mean?”

Hisano Kuroda: …I'm sorry. I'm saying foolish things. Yu-chan, you're still not used to this town, are you? If you ever have any problems, I can give you some advice. Haha… Though I'm sure you'd rather spend your time with younger ladies.

Teddie: Let's go, Sensei!

[The gang enters the TV World!]

> You showed the picture of Mitsuo Kubo to the others.

Yosuke Hanamura: That's him all right… It's definitely the guy on the Midnight Channel! It's settled, then. He is the killer… and he's in here now!

Rise Kujikawa: This guy came to our shop before… Was he… spying on me…? Oh my God… I really was being targeted…

Kanji Tatsumi: Dammit! Freakin' punk!

Chie Satonaka: Hey, I've seen him before too… Hmm… Oh, now I remember! Yukiko, it's that one guy!

Yukiko Amagi: That one guy…?

Chie Satonaka: Back in April, remember!? He suddenly came and started hitting on you!

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, him! The dude who got served by Yukiko in front of the school! Man, Chie, how'd you remember something like that!?

Chie Satonaka: Well, that was the first time he talked to her, but I remember he was always following her around.

Yukiko Amagi: Um… Sorry, who are we talking about?

Yosuke Hanamura: The dude who came right up to you at the school gates and called you Yuki!

Yukiko Amagi: Ohhhh… Uhh… Really?

Chie Satonaka: Wait, did he kidnap Yukiko to get back at her for rejecting him!?

Yukiko Amagi: Um… I didn't really reject him…

Rise Kujikawa: He came up to me while I was busy working and asked, ”Don't the biker gangs bother you?” Just going on and on about how biker gangs can't do anything unless they're in a pack and stuff… He seemed to be the type who just keeps talking, whether you like it or not… if that makes sense. I usually treat those people politely so they don't get offended, but I was so tired that I kinda ignored him. Was that why I was kidnapped…?

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh…? Wait, I'm not a biker! Ugh… That damn special report… So that's why I got dragged into this.

Chie Satonaka: You know, I heard he's been saying stuff about that announcer's affair, too. Lots of muttering about how women who cheat on their husbands should be executed.

Yosuke Hanamura: Sounds like it's all coming together… Well, it's time for a showdown! Can you tell where this Mitsuo guy's at?

Rise Kujikawa: I'll give it a try. Just a sec… 

[She uses her Persona to track Mitsuo.]

Rise Kujikawa: …Yeah, I found him! He's that way.

Chie Satonaka: Alright, let's go! We're so close to the killer… We can't lose him now! 

[They walk into… some kind of 8-bit game world. The road ends exactly at the title screen!]

Chie Satonaka: What is this…? Some kinda game?

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, he did taunt us, saying ”Try and catch me”… I guess he thinks of all this as a game.

Chie Satonaka: Ohhh, this pisses me off! I hereby sentence him to a hundred kicks to the face! Let's go!

”Let the games begin!”
”We gotta reach the ending!”
”Man, this is old-school.” ✓

Yosuke Hanamura: Gotta admit… All guys love games.

Teddie: And all girls love Teddie!

> You have pinpointed Mitsuo Kubo's location.

> All that's left is to reach him where he's waiting…

Rise Kujikawa: Huh!? No way… What's this all about? A-Anyways… We need to hurry on!

[The gang completes the second floor…]

*: Good morning. You seemed to have slept well last night. You slept so well that not even the noisy siren from the police cars woke you. I think something real bad happened… Can you go buy some coffee from the cafe at the arcade? Thanks. Did you hear a girl was killed? It's becoming a dangerous world out there… I don't even feel safe walking around town… Don't let your guard down, and make sure you're not out late, okay?

CHAPTER 44: Butterfly In The Sky
[A maze awaits the gang on the third floor…]

Rise Kujikawa: …Hmm? Weird… There's a dead end up ahead… I thought this was the right way… Huh!? What happened? You ended up somewhere else… Be careful, Senpai!

[The gang opens the door and enters.]

Chie Satonaka: Look! There he is!

Kanji Tatsumi: You Mitsuo!? You better be ready to pay, you bastard!

Yosuke Hanamura: Wait, Kanji… Something's not right!

[Mitsuo is talking to the Shadow self.]

Mitsuo Kubo: Everyone gets on my nerves… That's why I did it! What do you think of that!? Say something, dammit!

Mitsuo Kubo (Shadow): ……

Mitsuo Kubo: Nobody even thought of me after the first two people. That's why I went for the third one! I killed them!

Mitsuo Kubo (Shadow): ……

Mitsuo Kubo: Wh-What're you all quiet for…?

Mitsuo Kubo (Shadow): Because… I feel nothing…

Mitsuo Kubo: What're you talking about!? Make sense, dammit!

Chie Satonaka: What the…? Which one's the Shadow?

Mitsuo Kubo (Shadow): I… have nothing… I am nothing… And you… are me…

Mitsuo Kubo: What…? What's that supposed to mean!? I'm… I'm not nothing…

Yukiko Amagi: No! If this keeps up…!

Mitsuo Kubo: (notices the gang) Wh-Who are you guys!? How'd you get in here…? Dammit, who the hell are you!? What're you doing here!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Shut the hell up! We came after you!

Chie Satonaka: Are you the killer?

Mitsuo Kubo: Haha… Ahahahahaha! Of course I am! I'm the one behind everything! I don't give a damn what this impostor's saying! Hahaha, you hear that!? You have nothing to do with me! Get outta my sight!

Mitsuo Kubo (Shadow): ……

Mitsuo Kubo: That goes for the rest of you, too… Why'd you chase me all the way here!? I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you! I can do it, you know… I can do anything!

Mitsuo Kubo (Shadow): So you don't accept me…

[The shadow consumes Mitsuo.]

Mitsuo Kubo: Ngh… What the…? Aaaaargh!

[Mitsuo transforms into a baby with characters flying over his head like a halo.]

Yosuke Hanamura: Dammit, here we go again!

Rise Kujikawa: Get ready, everyone! Once we beat him, this case is as good as closed!

[The battle begins! The baby transforms into an 8-bit knight.]

Shadow Mitsuo: I am… a shadow… Come… I'll end your emptiness.

Teddie: It's all jaggy and blocky!

Yosuke Hanamura: Is that thing supposed to be a game character… ? Geez, how insulting can he get!?

Shadow Mitsuo: Come…

Rise Kujikawa: You'll have to destroy the outer shell first!

[The gang destroys Mitsuo’s Hero shell and then defeats the baby.]

Mitsuo Kubo: Ugh…

Yosuke Hanamura: Finally awake, huh? You've been a major pain in our ass.

Mitsuo Kubo: What the…? You guys… Wh-Who the hell are you guys!?

”We came to capture you.” ✓
”We came to rescue you.”
”We came to talk to you.”

Mitsuo Kubo: ……

Yosuke Hanamura: The police are after you. They think you're the one who killed King Moron and the other two. So…? Are you the killer?

Mitsuo Kubo: (triumphant) All the cases… All on me… Aha… hahaha! That's right, I did it!

Kanji Tatsumi: You piece of shit!

Mitsuo Kubo: (triumphant) And not just that bastard Morooka… That stupid announcer and the Konishi bitch, too! I killed all of them! It was all me!

[Mitsuo’s Shadow disappears.]

Rise Kujikawa: Wh-Where did it go!?

Chie Satonaka: What's going on…?

Mitsuo Kubo: Ha… Hahaha… It's gone… That frickin' monster disappeared… Take that, son of a bitch… Urgh…

Kanji Tatsumi: H-Hey!

Rise Kujikawa: He's exhausted… We need to hurry and get him out of here!

CHAPTER 47: Omelet Celebration
[The hang grabs Mitsuo and returns to the real world.]

Mitsuo Kubo: Where… am I…?

”It's the real world.” ✓
”It's Junes in town. ”
”Can't you tell?”

Mitsuo Kubo: Why… am I here…? What the hell are you guys…? S-Stop it… Why did the TV… Nngh…

Chie Satonaka: H-Hey…

Teddie: You seem confused from everything that happened. But we have a bunch of questions for you. First off, why did you do all this!? Answer in ten words or less!

Mitsuo Kubo: Haha… What the hell? Is that a costume…? Haha, what a loser… Get outta my face, you freak…

Teddie: F-Freak!? Grrrrr!

Yosuke Hanamura: Hold it, Teddie. You're not helping. 

”Are you the killer?”
”Did you really do it?” ✓

Mitsuo Kubo: Get off my back… I already told you… I did it…

Rise Kujikawa: Why…? How could you do such a thing?

Chie Satonaka: Three people are dead because of you…

Mitsuo Kubo: Ha… ha… haha… Hahahahahaha! Everyone's talking about it, right? It's a huge deal… and I did it! All of it! All by myself…!

Yosuke Hanamura: You just wanted the attention…?

Yukiko Amagi: Then why did you target me and the others? How did you kidnap us?

Mitsuo Kubo: *gasp* *gasp* Whoa… Look who it is… Haha, hey Yuki… After all this time… now you wanna talk to me? Haha… What bullshit.

Yukiko Amagi: Answer me! If you held a grudge against me, that's fine… But why the others!?

Mitsuo Kubo: Ha… Haha, what a joke… You're so desperate it hurts… I didn't care who I attacked… Everyone pisses me off…

Yosuke Hanamura: (furious) You what…? …Gotta be… kidding me…! You killed Senpai over nothing!? …You son of a bitch!!

Kanji Tatsumi: I hope you're ready to get what's comin' to you…

Mitsuo Kubo: *chuckle* What, you gonna kill me?

Yukiko Amagi: Kanji-kun!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Kill you…? It ain't gonna be that easy, you piece of shit. What you did can never be taken back. No, you're gonna own up to your crimes and pay for what you did. You ain't gonna be allowed to kick the bucket until you understand exactly what it is you've done!

Mitsuo Kubo: ……

Yosuke Hanamura: (furious) Why, dammit…? Why did she have to die because of this bastard…?

Mitsuo Kubo: ……

Kanji Tatsumi: Dude… The cops.

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh?

Kanji Tatsumi: What're you waiting for!? Call the damn police!

Yosuke Hanamura: Y-Yeah… You're right…

Chie Satonaka: Yosuke…

[The police arrive… The gang returns to the foodcourt.]

Chie Satonaka: At least Adachi-san seemed happy…

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, I guess this means our work is done…

Chie Satonaka: He did it all to draw attention… I can't get my head around that. It's just wrong. I mean, not that it would've been okay if he'd had a better reason… I know… Don't worry.

Rise Kujikawa: It's finally over… Let's leave the rest to the police.

Teddie: My world will be peaceful again now.

Yukiko Amagi: Yeah. I'm happy for you. We really went through a lot…

Teddie: Like scoring with guys!

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, come on…! Will you ever let it go?

Kanji Tatsumi: What…? Scoring with guys!?

Yukiko Amagi: Y-You don't need to know the details. I'm sure you'd like us to forget the sauna incident too… right Kanji-kun?

Kanji Tatsumi: Urgh… W-Well…

Rise Kujikawa: That's not fair… I wanted to see everyone else's too!

Yosuke Hanamura: That's right. We three are the only ones who saw everyone's secret.

Chie Satonaka: Hey, so what was Yosuke's like? C'mon, it's about time you told us.

”It was embarrassing.”
”I don't remember much.” ✓
”Pretty much like the rest.”

Yosuke Hanamura: C-C'mon, let's leave it at that! Speaking of which, nothing really happened in your case, huh?

Rise Kujikawa: Really… Wait, really? Is there something special about Senpai after all?

Teddie: Sensei is da man!

Kanji Tatsumi: But now that the case is solved, we won't be calling you ”Leader” anymore, will we…?

Chie Satonaka: Oh yeah… It's kinda sad.

Rise Kujikawa: Hey, why don't we have a celebration? We always have a wrap party after we're done shooting. It's fun, and it'll help give us some closure.

Chie Satonaka: Oooh, a party! That sounds great! Let's go all out!

Teddie: Ooh, ooh! I wanna go to Yuki-chan's house! Gorgeous dinner, hot springs, table tennis, yukata! Geisha, Fujiyama, full wootness!

Kanji Tatsumi: You're right, Yukiko-senpai's family runs a hot springs inn… A-A hot spring that… Yukiko-senpai bathes in too…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, keep it to yourself… You're sounding like a creep.

Yukiko Amagi: W-Well, it sounds like fun, but I don't think it's possible today…

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, it's summer vacation. All the rooms must be occupied.

Teddie: We can't do a sleepover…?

Yukiko Amagi: Maybe next time. I promise.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, why don't we hit your place instead? Oh, but will your uncle get suspicious? Like, ”Why are you all celebrating?”

”No problem at all.”
”Alright, let's do this!” ✓
”You mind if Nanako is there?”

Rise Kujikawa: Great! Let's head over right away!

Chie Satonaka: Oh yeah, if your uncle's a detective, he might not come home tonight… Nanako-chan might be getting hungry.

Yukiko Amagi: Hey, then why don't we make dinner together?

Rise Kujikawa: Wow… Are you good at cooking, Senpai?

Chie Satonaka: W-Well… sort of?

Yosuke Hanamura: What are you saying…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Did you already forget the tragedy of the school campout!?

Chie Satonaka: W-We already told you that was an accident!

Yukiko Amagi: She's right! We just got a couple of the ingredients wrong!

Yosuke Hanamura: Guys, please don't do this, I'm begging you… I don't need another trauma to deal with…

Rise Kujikawa: Hey, I'm a good cook too! I'll make something for you, Senpai.

Teddie: Tadaaaah! Teddie has a great idea! Let's have a cooking battle! The winner will be crowned Iron Cook Inaba!

Yosuke Hanamura: A cooking battle? Now I'm even more worried…

Chie Satonaka: S-Sure, that sounds like fun.

Rise Kujikawa: Aww, but I'll win hands-down. You sure you want to make it that easy?

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude, listen to me. For the sake of our stomachs, you have to cook something too. Help us, Yu! You're our only hope…

Chie Satonaka: Then you can represent the guys' team. Nanako-chan will be our judge!

Kanji Tatsumi: I can be a taster too!

Teddie: Teddie can be a tester too! At the end, you're supposed to say, ”That was delicious!” right?

Chie Satonaka: Woo! I'm getting all fired up! Alright! Let us advance forth into the grocery section downstairs! Chaaarge!

> Junes, Grocery department…

> You decided to call Nanako to tell her about the cooking competition.

Nanako Dojima (via phone): Hello, Dojima residence… Oh, hi. Yeah, he said he's gonna be late today. Huh…? Dinner? You're all going to cook?

Chie Satonaka: Ask Nanako-chan what she wants for dinner!

Nanako Dojima (via phone): What do I want…? Um… Anything's fine.

Yukiko Amagi: She's just being modest! Ask her again.

Nanako Dojima: Well, umm… An omelette. I wanna eat omelette with fried rice. Okay, I'll be waiting!

> You ended the phone call.

> Nanako seems to be looking forward to it.

Yosuke Hanamura: Fried rice omelette… An excellent choice, Nanako-chan. With a dish that simple, I doubt we'll get a second helping of Mystery Food X. …Huh? What's wrong?

Chie Satonaka: …N-Nothing. Alright, let's go get our ingredients.

Yosuke Hanamura: Uh… If they're all making the same thing, why are they splitting up to different parts of the market…? Looks like you'll need all the help I can give you… Hey, what kind of omelette are you making? I'll go get the ingredients for ya.

> What kind of omelette should you make…?

Orthodox, ketchup flavored
Asian American, soy flavored ✓
Herb filled, Provence style
Aromatic, Mediterranean style

> You gave Yosuke a list of ingredients you'll need…

> Everyone brought their basic ingredients to the cart.

Yosuke Hanamura: Foie gras!?

Rise Kujikawa: (cute voice) Quite an eye you got there, Senpai. It's a must-have for my special omelette! Don't worry, I'll let you have a taste. Ooh, or maybe I could spoon feed you. *chuckle* I heard last time you choked down something so awful that words couldn't describe it…

Yosuke Hanamura: It was horrible…

Rise Kujikawa: (cute voice) You poor dears… Who would do such a horrible thing…?

Chie Satonaka: Rise-san? This is going to be the only chance you get to gloat, is that clear?

Yukiko Amagi: …I'll crush you with one strike.

Kanji Tatsumi: Whoa… You guys look like you're ready to enter the Ultimate Frying Championship.

Yukiko Amagi: Kanji-kun! That's alcohol!

Kanji Tatsumi: Huh…? Oh, uh… Hahaha…

Chie Satonaka: By the way, where's Teddie?

Teddie's voice: Miss? Am I allowed to eat this?

Sample tray lady: Of course you can, dear. Eat as much as you like!

Teddie: You're such a nice lady. Is this one cooked already?

Sample tray lady: *giggle* This one's ready too.

Sample tray lady: Oh my, are you hungry for more? Here… I'll open this one too.

Teddie: You're so beautiful…

Sample tray lady: Oh my, no! No, I mustn't! I've got a husband and a son!

Teddie: But I really want this meat… And I want you to cook it, Miss.

Sample tray lady: Ohhh, I couldn't possibly. The manager would get so upset.

Yosuke Hanamura: I'm gonna knock the stuffing outta that bear…

[Evening. The gang is already at Dojima’s residence. You, Teddie and Nanako are talking at the table. The others make their omelets.]

Teddie: Rise-chan was right… This celebration does make me feel like it's over… The case really has come to an end… ……

Nanako Dojima: Wow! It's really Rise-chan!

Teddie: I should go back over there soon…

Nanako Dojima: Are you going somewhere?

Teddie: Yep… The guys kept their promise.

Nanako Dojima: A promise, huh…? What if you made a promise with me? Could you stay then?

Teddie: A promise… with Nana-chan?

Nanako Dojima: Um… A promise that you'll play with me. How about that?

Teddie: Sensei… You kept your promise with me… So I should go back over there…

”I forgot all about that.”
”Don't worry about it.” ✓

Teddie: B-But… a promise is a promise… It's not good to break them…

”It'll be lonely without you.”
”You promised Nanako…” ✓
”Don't go, Teddie!”

Teddie: S-Sensei… My promise with Nana-chan… I made a promise to play with her… Can I really stay here…? It wasn't just my promise. Nana-chan made it with me… I'm really… really happy… Thank you…!

[Yosuke approaches.]

Teddie: Yosuke… I have a new promise to keep… S-So, I wanna stay here a little longer! Is that okay with you, Sir!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Huh? What're you talking about? You're not going anywhere. You can't just quit your job like that. In any case, if you left--

Rise Kujikawa: It's reeeeeaaaaadyyyy! Incoming food! Out of the way, Senpai! (pushes Yosuke)

Yosuke Hanamura: Whoa! Ow!

[They all sit at the table. Time to celebrate the victory!]

Rise Kujikawa: Bon appetit!

Yosuke Hanamura: W-Well, wait a sec. Asking Nanako-chan to jump in and try these for us is kinda… unethical.

Chie Satonaka: D-Don't look at us like that!

Kanji Tatsumi: Ohhh… So it's our job to taste it first, to make sure we can keep it down.

Rise Kujikawa: Hey! That's mean!

Yosuke Hanamura: You don't mind me going first? Actually, I've been looking forward to yours. I mean, Risette cooked it herself. Can you imagine how many guys would kill me if they found out? Well then, chow time! Urgh… I-I… can't give this to Nanako-chan…

Rise Kujikawa: Ooh! It's so delicious that you won't let anyone else have a bite!?

> In any case, you should try eating it too…

> …It's spicy!

> The spiciness and heat are like lava in your mouth…!

> You can't taste or feel the foie gras at all…

> It's starting to taste like iron… For some reason, you sense a dull pain in your mouth as well…

> You can't give this to Nanako…

Yukiko Amagi: Here, try mine next.

Kanji Tatsumi: I'll take this one.

Yosuke Hanamura: K-Kanji… That's a lot…

Yukiko Amagi: H-Hey, say something.

Kanji Tatsumi: Well… Uh… How do I put this…? It tastes really, um… boneless…?

Yukiko Amagi: What!? That's not a word you use to describe taste! Does it taste good or not!? Tell me!

> It doesn't seem to be dangerous…

> But you don't sense any flavors in particular…

> In fact… you don't taste anything at all! You can't even taste the ingredients…

> How could this be…?

Kanji Tatsumi: Not good, that's for sure. It tastes like… Like I'm eating plain oatmeal… It's pretty impressive that you put so many ingredients into a dish and it came out tasting like nothing.

Yukiko Amagi: Y-Your palate just isn't refined enough!

Nanako Dojima: …I think it tastes good.

Yukiko Amagi: Nanako-chan…!

Chie Satonaka: O-Okay… Try mine next. Urgh… I dunno about this… But I think it'll taste good! This time for sure!

Teddie: I'll give it a whirl.

Chie Satonaka: H-How is it…?

Teddie: Wow, this tastes awful! You have to try this, Yosuke.

Yosuke Hanamura: Dude, not after you say that… Ahhh… I see…

> …It does taste awful.

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, um… It's a huge improvement over the curry…

Chie Satonaka: Yeah, thanks for the consolation… I feel soooo much better…

Nanako Dojima: I think this tastes good too.

Chie Satonaka: Nanako-chan…!

Yukiko Amagi: Oh yeah, they're right…

Yukiko Amagi: They're totally right! It tastes awful! Ahahahaha!

Chie Satonaka: Then try Rise-chan's! I bet you anything mine tastes better than hers!

[Yukiko tries Rise-chan’s omelet…]

Yukiko Amagi: U-Urhg…

[She begins to choke and in a second falls to the floor.]

Rise Kujikawa: S-Senpai!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Sure enough… One strike.

Yosuke Hanamura: Well, Yukiko and Chie's didn't taste good either… But at least theirs didn't cause any casualties… Haha…

Rise Kujikawa: (holding tears) I-It's a taste too subtle for kids! It's a mature flavor! You guys are just kids… I, I… *sniff* Waaaaaaah…

Nanako Dojima: Ngh…! It's spicy, but it's still good.

Rise Kujikawa: Nanako-chan…! I knew it! Nanako-chan's the most mature person in this room!

Chie Satonaka: C-Crocodile tears!?

Kanji Tatsumi: Oh yeah, didn't you make one too, Senpai?

Nanako Dojima: You did!? Ooh… This is really good! I've never had an omelette with fried rice this good! It's amazing!

> The omelette seems to be a big success. She's eating it extremely cheerfully!

Nanako Dojima: Yep, it's good too!

> It seems to have come out pretty well. She's eating it cheerfully.

Chie Satonaka: Are you full, Nanako-chan?

Yosuke Hanamura: We're still starving…

Chie Satonaka: If you're so hungry, then help yourself to an awful-tasting omelette! Hmph!

Yosuke Hanamura: U-Uh, I have a suggestion… You guys know about the festival they're holding in the shopping district, right? Why don't we all go?

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, that sounds good!

Teddie: Whoa! Does that mean the girls will be wearing yukata!?

{Yukata is a traditional Japanese garment, which is a summer casual cotton, linen or hemp kimono without a lining.}

Nanako Dojima: A festival…

Yosuke Hanamura: We'll bring Nanako-chan along too.

Nanako Dojima: I can come?

”Of course.” ✓
”If you want.”

Nanako Dojima: Really!? Yay!

Yosuke Hanamura: That settles it, then.

Kanji Tatsumi: Festival food always tastes great for some reason, even if it ain't anything fancy. Whew… We'll finally be able to get some edible food for once.

> You promised the others you'd go to the festival at the shopping district.

> The culprit has finally been caught. The rest is up to the police inquiry…

Teddie: Sensei! Welcome! Oooooh! Who's this girl? Is she your ”skirt” ? You're quite the naughty boy, aren'tcha?

Marie: …What the heck is this thing? It's moving. …Gross.

Teddie: Bwuh!? *sniff* How rude! How can you say that about cute little moi…

Marie: And it talks… What's it made out of?

Teddie: Ahem! This Teddie is fifty percent kindness, by volume.

Marie: Huh? …What about the other half?

Teddie: Teddie fur.

Marie: Kindness and… fur…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Oh, hey, it's Yu and Marie-chan! Whatcha up to this time? Taking a tour of Junes? Oh, well, if that's what you're doing, I'm just the man you need. Welcome to Junes, Yasoinaba branch!

Marie: Huh? I don't need a tour. I already saw it.

Teddie: WhoooOOOOa! Yosuke got deeeeenied!

Marie: Who's this old-timer?

Kanji Tatsumi: O… Old-timer!?

”I see what you mean.”
”Kanji isn't that old.” ✓

Yosuke Hanamura: Yeah, he's younger than we are… I guess.

Kanji Tatsumi: What the…? What kind of defense is that!?

Rise Kujikawa: Kanji, what are you yelling about? I thought you came to talk with Yosuke-sen-- Oh! Senpa-- (sees Marie) …Whoa. Senpai? Who is this girl? What is she doing with you?

Marie: …I know this person. I heard about her from Margaret. ”Someone even I can't handle.”

”It's not quite like that.”
”That's about right.” ✓

Rise Kujikawa: That's not how it goes! It's ”Something even I can handle!”

Marie: …That's not so different.

Rise Kujikawa: Yes it is! Yosuke-senpai, what's with this girl!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Me!? Er, she's Marie-chan, Yu's mate…

Rise Kujikawa: What!? ”Mate”…?

Yosuke Hanamura: Sorry… I think I just added fuel to the fire.

Chie Satonaka: Huh? Heyyyy! Oh, everyone's here.

Yukiko Amagi: Oh, Marie-chan's with you, too? Hello.

Kanji Tatsumi: Senpais, you know her?

Yukiko Amagi: We had fun together the other day. Right, Marie-chan?

Kanji Tatsumi: I don't recognize you. Which high school are you from? Wait… You're even younger than me. Which middle school are you from?

Marie: Middle school? What's that supposed to mean? You're pretty rude, old-timer.

Kanji Tatsumi: Why do you keep calling me old!?

Yosuke Hanamura: Y'know, I don't know much about her, either. How old are you, Marie-chan? Where do you live? Are you here on vacation?

Marie: I don't… I don't remember.

Chie Satonaka: Yosuke! You're scaring the poor girl!

Kanji Tatsumi: Yeah, Senpai. Not very sub-buttle of you.

Yosuke Hanamura: Hey, you brought it up! …Wait, what? What did you just say…?

”Sub-buttle.”
”Subtle.” ✓

Rise Kujikawa: Did you think the word ”subtle” is pronounced ”sub-buttle”?

Teddie: Kanji's got a sub-buttle.

Kanji Tatsumi: Sh-Shut up! Quit talking about my butt!

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, ugh… Why'd you make me think about your butt!? You're the most un-subtle person ever.

Yukiko Amagi: The un-subtle sub-buttle… *snrk* Haha, hahaha, hahahahaha!

Marie: Ha… Ha.

> You spent time with your friends and Marie…

> After everyone is done hanging out, they go home…

Marie: …Those were funny people. I don't get them. They're loud and stupid. So stupid. ”Sub-buttle…” *snicker*

> Despite her complaints, Marie appears to be enjoying herself.

> You feel you have grown closer to Marie now…

> The Marie Social Link has reached level 5!

”I’ll help.” ✓
”How?” 
”Good luck.”

Marie: Please do. I don't know what to do.

Chie Satonaka: Yooo, Yu-kun! Funny coincidence bumping into you here. Man, I took another look at my closet at home the other day, and thought, wow… they really are all green. It made me remember what Marie-chan said to me, hahaha… Oh, by the way, how's she doing? Tell her I want to go clothes shopping with her again! Yooo, Yu-kun… It feels kinda weird, meeting on our day off.

> It seems Chie isn't busy…

Chie Satonaka: I've got nothing to do since the study group get-together for the scooter licenses got canceled today. I dunno, maybe I could just memorize the road signs on my own. Hahaha…

Chie Satonaka: What are you up to!?

Punk: Huh? Aw, not her again.

Punk leader: Heheh, I know how to handle this bitch. Huhuhuh! You look like you got something planned!

Crying kid: H-Help…

Punk leader: Hear that, ”Chie-chan” ? He wants help.

Chie Satonaka: How do you know my name…?

Punk leader: We ran into the guy you saved last time… Had a friendly conversation. He told us all kindsa stuff. Like where you live, and about that precious ”Yukiko-san” of yours.

Chie Satonaka: …What are you trying to pull!?

Punk leader: Oh, I'm just gonna have a little chat with this kid. Stay put, okay? 'Cause who knows what'll happen to ”Yukiko-san” if you get in our way…?

Punk: Huhuhuh! Man, that's nasty!

Chie Satonaka: Why, you…!!

Chie Satonaka: Rrrgh… Fine, then hit me! You're pissed at me, right!? Then why don't you just take a swing at me? I won't fight back. Be my guest! The face, the gut, just pick a target! As hard as you want! C'mon!!

Punk leader: …Freak.

Punk: What's with this bitch… She for real? Whatever, man… Let's go…

”Did something happen?” ✓
”Are you not feeling well?”
”Are we done here?”

Sayoko Uehara: …Stop it. Do you think you're some kind of counselor now? I'm sorry… There's no point in taking it out on you… I just got a call from the hospital I last worked at. The patient I was assigned to… died. He was still just a little child… He always said he wanted to go to school… But it looks like he'll never get that chance… You know, he proposed to me… I told him I'd think about it when he became an adult. But I… I forgot about him! When I transferred here, I was so busy. I thought about him once in a while, but soon I just forgot… But he was fighting for his life that entire time! What am I doing…?

”Don't blame yourself.” ✓
”It couldn't be helped.”
”Think about what you did.”

Sayoko Uehara: I do… Of course I blame myself… Why did I transfer…? When a patient gets better, I get left behind… But, now I'm the one who left a patient behind… There should've been something I could have done…

Rise Kujikawa: Hey, Senpai! Are you out shopping? That was so much fun the other day, hanging out with Marie-chan. But I'm not crazy about how Yosuke-senpai seemed so head over heels for her. I mean, think about it. Isn't he supposed to be a Risette superfan? Speaking of all that, how's Marie-chan doing? She's got a mouth on her, but she's really pretty cute. Next time we all get together, we should call her up too! Oh, Senpai. If you're free, let's go play!

> It seems Rise is free…

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, that reminds me, the other senpai and me had a study session for the license exam the other day. I'm a pretty quick study, so I'll be fine, but I wonder if those two will be okay… Geez, if we don't get it together, this summer is sunk.

> Rise looks like she's having fun…

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, come to think of it, where does Kanji buy his clothes? You can't find pointy stuff like those at Junes, can you? Does he buy them online…? Maybe he makes them…?

[A guy approaches…]

Suspicious Guy: U-Umm… A-Aren't you Risette? Eh, I-I-I-I…

Rise Kujikawa: No… I'm not. Let's go, Senpai.

> Rise dragged you away…

> Many people approached Rise over the course of the day…

Rise Kujikawa: They just never learn! *sigh* But I told them! I told them today, Senpai! ”No, I'm not.” ”You're mistaken.” ”I'm not Risette!” And it's true… I'm no longer ”Risette”… I'm just an ordinary girl… *giggle* Which is fine with me! I never thought I'd be out in public like this. I love Inaba, Senpai… You see the same faces every day, rumors spread fast, and there are times when it gets on my last nerve… And sometimes I feel I might be better off if I was in a big city full of strangers… But even then, I love that town. You're there, Grandma's there… And above all, there's something I can do there. Let's keep at it, Senpai!

Hisano Kuroda: But still… The more I look at you, the more you remind me of him.
His nose was just a little lower than yours, and his eyes a bit smaller, and his hair was shorter… Haha, he was a handsome man.

”Who are you talking about?” ✓
”So he didn't look like me?”
”Stop staring at me.”

Hisano Kuroda: Haha… My husband. He was a kind man. Quite an attractive one, too…

> Hisano smiles nostalgically…

Hisano Kuroda: My husband passed away recently… Do I look like Death to you?

”Yes, you do.”
”No, you don't.” ✓
”This is stupid.”

Hisano Kuroda: I see… …You mustn't become Death.

> Your power to create Personas of the Death Arcana has grown!

Hisano Kuroda: When I'm with you, I feel like he has forgiven me… That can't possibly be true, though… After all, I'm the one who… …I'll see you later, Yu-chan.

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, Senpai. If you're free, let's go play!

> It seems Rise is free…

Rise Kujikawa: Oh, that reminds me, the other senpai and me had a study session for the license exam the other day. I'm a pretty quick study, so I'll be fine, but I wonder if those two will be okay… Geez, if we don't get it together, this summer is sunk.

Rise Kujikawa: Yeah! Where shall we go?

> Rise looks happy.

> Central shopping district…

> You decided to walk Rise home after eating at Aiya…

Rise Kujikawa: The flavor was a little strong, but it was good. My grandma's food is kind of bland. Though tofu is good for you, so…

> There is a suspicious man in front of Rise's house…

Rise Kujikawa: Is that a reporter…? Or… a stalker?

> Rise is worried…

Yell
Call the police
Grab her hand and run ✓

Rise Kujikawa: Uh, th-that's alright. We don't know if he's really dangerous or not. Let's just wait and see, okay? But… thanks for that.

> Rise no longer seems worried.

Rise Kujikawa: Hmm, but still… That guy… Where have I…?

[She approaches him.]

Rise Kujikawa: Inoue-san, is that you!?

Inoue: Rise-chan!

Rise Kujikawa: Wh-Why are you here…? I already settled everything with the agency…!

Inoue: I'm here because… Personally, I can't accept that. I've watched over you this entire time as your manager…

Rise Kujikawa: I'm no longer a ”personality”! My private time doesn't belong to a manager anymore! Go home. If you don't, I'll call the police.

Inoue: W-Wait! Could you just think it over? I strongly believe that no other actress can play that role better than Rise Kujikawa. Your fans were looking forward to the movie, too…

Rise Kujikawa: You still want me to act…!?

Inoue: Huh…?

Rise Kujikawa: …Anyway, I'm through with it! I have nothing to do with showbiz and all that stuff now! ……I-I've decided to marry this man once we graduate high school! I said before it was only a hiatus, but I've changed my mind! There's no way I'm coming back! Yu sees the real me… He's so gentle…!

> Rise is desperate…

Go along with her ✓
Deny it

> You went along with her story…

Rise Kujikawa: S-See? I told you…

> Rise looks relieved…

Inoue: ……I understand. I'll go home… for today. B-But I…

Rise Kujikawa: Go away! Now!

[Inoue leaves.]

Rise Kujikawa: Oh… U-Ummm… …That was Inoue-san. He was… my manager. I'm his daughter's age, so he treated me like one of the family… But… he's a stranger now. S-Senpai, umm… I'm sorry… Lying about marrying you and all…

”I don't mind.”
”Lying is wrong.”
”It… It was a lie?” ✓

Rise Kujikawa: Huh…? ”Was it a lie?” O-Oh… Senpai… W-Wow…

> Somewhat at a loss, Rise is smiling sheepishly…

Rise Kujikawa: You really are a nice guy. Th-This isn't good… I feel like I'm going to depend on you even more… …J-Just kidding!

> Perhaps due to her relief, Rise is smiling sheepishly…

> You feel your relationship with Rise has grown deeper…

> The Rise Kujikawa Social Link has reached level 4!

> Your power to create Personas of the Lovers Arcana has grown!

> Your room…

> You feel a little uneasy about having two guys in your room…

Kou Ichijo: Your room's… kinda weird… Not too spacious, and yet not too cramped… Not too dark, either…

Daisuke Nagase: Hey, don't bitch about other people's rooms.

Kou Ichijo: Wh-What? I wasn't bitching… …Anyway, looks like you're a little short on stuff to read. Why don't you take this? Tadaaa! ”The O-Cha Way”… Want it?

”Sure.” ✓
”Not interested.”

Kou Ichijo: I'm sure you'll understand it. It's written to teach tea ceremony to foreigners. …It was too complex for Daisuke, but that's not saying much. Haha.

> Obtained The O-Cha Way.

Kou Ichijo: He gave it back to me like a day after he borrowed it… Now I can finally stop lugging that stupid thing around.

[Nanko enters the room.]

Nanako Dojima: Do we have guests, big bro?

Kou Ichijo: Oh, is she your sister, Yu? We should all play something. Don't you get lonely when your big brother doesn't play with you?

Nanako Dojima: …No, I'm fine!

Tired nurse: Uh, which room was it again? The one with the patient Uehara-san mentioned.

Pale nurse: What!? You'd better get going now, or she'll yell at you!

Tired nurse: She's been really scary lately…

Pale nurse: She's been trying too… Ah!

[Sayoko walks in.]

Sayoko Uehara: If you have time to chat, you have time to go check on all the patients. Nakata-san, Room 512! Did you finish disimpacting the patient?

Tired nurse: I… I was just about to go…

Sayoko Uehara: I see you're skilled at slacking off. Takahashi-san, the equipment order form wasn't filled out properly. In several places.

Pale nurse: I-I-I'm sorry, I'll fix it right--

Sayoko Uehara: I've already fixed it and sent it in! Just go.

[The nurses leave.]

Sayoko Uehara: Yu-kun… I see you're working. That's good. I'll be going, then…

”You should get some rest…”
”Hang in there.” ✓

Sayoko Uehara: Right, I can still work.

Rise Kujikawa: Yeah! Where shall we go?

> Rise looks happy.

> The hill overlooking town…

> You came here at Rise's request, as she says she likes it here…

Rise Kujikawa: When I first got to town, I used to sit here and do nothing… I would just listen to the sound of the river, the sound of the birds, the sound of the rain… I felt I could forget ”Risette” and find myself that way… But… Senpai, have you ever thought that you're pushing yourself too far, or that you were just acting…?

”All the time.” ✓
”Sometimes…”
”Not really.”

Rise Kujikawa: Really…? Then you might even be a better actor than me. But I see… You've been through a lot, too…

> It seems Rise is a bit relieved.

Rise Kujikawa: I feel like I've been able to relax after coming to Inaba. Meeting all of you, laughing together… Watching the store, reading comics, playing with the cat… …When I was at my parents' house, I was on my best behavior around them… Oh, but Grandma doesn't ask me anything. Y'know, like why I quit or what I'm thinking of doing next… She just talks about tofu. She says… I'm like tofu. I had to ask her what that meant. The way she explained it… Tofu looks weak and fragile, but it's actually pretty resilient. Even though it stands out because it's not like any other food, it can be mixed in with any recipe or flavor.. Tofu is incredible. I'm nothing like that… I… I was actually bullied at school before I made my debut… I wasn't good at talking, and always looked at my feet… I was alone the entire time… But I didn't have a problem with that. No one expected anything of me. And then… the application my relative sent without telling me passed the first audition. I wasn't interested in being an idol, but… I wanted the chance to change myself. And just by chance, I won. Haha… When it happened, I panicked, thinking maybe I should turn their offer down. Then I thought… if I appeared on TV, I could make friends… That was literally the only reason I went through with it… After a while… I realized something. The person everyone likes, the one they say ”hi” to on the street? That's not the real me. Risette is the one everyone likes… The fictional character they sold the public. …It's the same with you, isn't it? You don't have to deny it… I won't be mad. You're with me right now because I'm Risette, yeah?

”That's right.”
”No.”
”I don't know…” ✓

Rise Kujikawa: W-Wow, I'm kinda surprised… You project this image of strength, so I didn't expect you to say that… But I see… You're just a year older than me, huh? I never thought of that…

> Rise is smiling sheepishly.

Rise Kujikawa: When I got back to school after my debut, no one bullied me… I was happy at first, with people I didn't even know talking to me… But they weren't suddenly interested in Rise Kujikawa… They wanted to hang out with Risette. The bullying stopped, but… I felt like none of them saw the real me. In my heart, I've always thought… ”This isn't the real me…” Funny, huh? I was the one who wanted to change, and… done being Risette! Now I have people who know the real me. Plus, I have power that can help everyone… I love that! This time, I'm going to change into a Rise that everyone can like! Keep an eye out for her, Senpai!

> Rise is smiling…

> You feel that you understand Rise even more…

> The Rise Kujikawa Social Link has reached level 5!

> Your power to create Personas of the Lovers Arcana has grown!

> Rise's growth of heart has affected her Persona as well…

> You walked Rise to her house and went home.

[Evening.]

[You, Dojima, Adachi and Nanako having dinner together.]

Tohru Adachi: Wow, what a great spread! I've never seen so many pieces of fatty tuna!

Ryotaro Dojima: If you're gonna have a celebration, you can't do it halfway.

Nanako Dojima: Celebration?

Ryotaro Dojima: Ah, it's about this. Watch.

Announcer: ”I didn't care who it was.” ”I was pissed off.” ”I wanted to be famous.” The suspect was often heard saying these things… The young suspect has confessed to being the culprit behind the recent cases, but he's shown no remorse so far. Because of several inconsistencies in the boy's deposition, some have called for a mental examination to be carried out. Until then, the police will be continuing their investigation to shed light on all the prior incidents.

Tohru Adachi: It was actually really tough to make a case out of this. All we had was the suspect's confession and some circumstantial evidence. But the lab found the perp's prints on the victim's clothes, so we made it stick after all. Man, isn't crime scene investigation something? Who would've thought you could get viable prints from cloth?

Ryotaro Dojima: There's no more scary stuff to worry about. You're safe now.

Nanako Dojima: Uh-huh!

Tohru Adachi: Man, that guy was twisted. A high schooler committing multiple murders and leaving the bodies like that… He was over the edge. Good thing we caught him! Now I can stop seeing suspects in every shadow! If the killer was still on the loose…

Ryotaro Dojima: Enough, Adachi! If you keep running your mouth, the sushi's gonna dry up!

Tohru Adachi: Oh, you're right. Sorry!

Ryotaro Dojima: C'mon everyone, eat up.

Tohru Adachi: Well, since you asked… Huh? You don't like sushi, Nanako-chan?

Nanako Dojima: There's wasabi in it…

Ryotaro Dojima: Ahh, that's right. I forgot to tell them to hold the wasabi. Here, I'll take it off for you. Which one do you want? Hmm?

Nanako Dojima: …Halibut!

Tohru Adachi: Excellent taste, Nanako-chan. As for me, I'll go for sea urchin…

Ryotaro Dojima: Hey, there's only one of those!

Tohru Adachi: Too late! First come, first serve.

> It's been a while since dinner has been this lively…

August 14th, 2011. Sunday
> Mitsuo confessed his crime and was apprehended. You wonder if the incidents will end now…

> The Sumner Festival will begin soon…

[Your phone’s ringing.]

Chie Satonaka: Oh, hello? It's me, Chie. I ran into Yosuke at Junes. He said he was really in a bind because he didn't have enough employees working at Junes. He's probably going to come to you and beg for you to rescue him. He'll be all, ”You've gotta save me from this chaos, Yu!” I feel kinda sorry for him, so I'm gonna help him out this week. You're welcome too, Yu-kun!

> Chie hung up.

> Maybe you should help out at Junes too…

> You realize that you haven't bought anything from the home shopping program this week. Maybe you should watch it…
