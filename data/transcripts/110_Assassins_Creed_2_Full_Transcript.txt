If you want to read the first game beforehand, it has already been transcribed by Axel7174 and Sarranduin.

[We get into Desmond’s room. Since the first game he’s constantly using Animus and beginning to hallucinate. He can hardly distinguish between reality and the past life of his ancestor, Altaïr. Desmond’s voice comes from behind the scenes, giving us an idea of what his thoughts are.]

Desmond Miles: My name is Desmond Miles. I’m a prisoner of war. A war I never knew existed, waged by two groups I never thought were real: Templars and Assassins. The Animus showed me the truth… The things I’ve seen, the things I’ve been… A thousand years of history flowing through my veins, brought to life by this machine. They’re using it, using me, to search for something. They call it the Apple. It’s an artifact, one of the many so-called "Pieces of Eden". Templars collect them… It’s how they stay in power. And if the Templars get their hands on another one, everything would change. They want to make us all their slaves. When they first brought me here, I was afraid of what would happen if I tried to fight back. Now? Heh… Now I’m afraid of what will happen if I don’t.

[He gets out of bed and goes to Animus. Lucy stands next to it.]

Desmond Miles: But I can’t do it alone, and maybe I don’t have to. I met someone: Her name is Lucy. I think she’s on my side. She’s gone now, taken away by that bastard Warren Vidic and his Templar masters. I don’t know what will happen to her… what will happen to me…All I know is I need to get out of here, and I need to do it soon. My name is Desmond Miles. And this is my story.

[Some time passes. One day, after Desmond leaves Animus, Lucy enters the laboratory. She is worried about something.]

Lucy Stillman: We have to go.

Desmond Miles: Lucy! Where have you been? Why did they—

Lucy Stillman: Now.

[Desmond follows Lucy to Animus.]

Lucy Stillman: Get in.

Desmond Miles: What’s with the blood? Are you okay?

Lucy Stillman: Look, we have maybe ten minutes - maybe - before they figure out what I’ve done. If we’re not out of here and on the road before then…

Desmond Miles: Wait, we’re leaving?

Lucy Stillman: Desmond, I promise I’ll answer ALL of your questions. Later. But right now, I need you to just shut up and do what I say. So please get in the Animus.

Desmond Miles: Alright…

Lucy Stillman: Hurry up Desmond! We’re running out of time!

[Desmond lies in Animus. His face covers the transparent screen. On it we will see the messages "SUBJECT 17 DESMOND MILES" "SUBJECT 16 CONFIDENTIAL" "SEARCHING FOR RELEVANT DATA… MEMORY MATCH FOUND. ACCESSING MEMORY." We are teleporting to the past, to Italy. A woman gives birth to a child. She is assisted by maids.]

Memory Sequence 01: Ignorance Is Bliss
Maid: Spingi! Spingi! (Push! Push!) Di nuovo! (Again!) Si! Si! Brava! (Yes! Yes! Good!) It is a boy!

[Her husband rushes into the room.]

Husband: Oh, my love! Mi dispiace! (I’m sorry!) I was at the bank when they told me! Did I miss it?! Am I too late? (sees the child) Give him here…

Woman: Giovanni…?

Giovanni: Shhh, my love. It will be alright. Tu sei un Auditore. Sei un combattente. Perciò combatti! (You are an Auditore. You are a fighter. So fight!)

[The player is provided with an interesting training option. He is shown combat control, and the child in return moves his arms or legs. In the end the child cries.]

Giovanni: Listen to him! A fine set of lungs!

Woman: And what shall we call him, my love?

Giovanni: Ezio! Ezio Auditore da Firenze!

[He lifts the child in his arms up. At this moment we see a flash of future adventures of the newborn, after which Desmond leaves Animus.]

Lucy Stillman: Get up. Let’s go.

Desmond Miles: Ya well, uh, I’m gonna need a second…

Lucy Stillman: There isn’t time, Desmond. We have to leave.

[She takes a disk out of the control desk of Animus. They run out of the laboratory.]

Desmond Miles: We’re really gettin’ out of here, huh… Abstergo’s got some fucked up interior decorators…

Lucy Stillman: Do you want us to get caught? Stay close.

Security: Hey! You’re not supposed to be up here! Open this door!

Security 2: I’m calling it in! We have a breach in the research wing. I repeat there’s been a breach in the research wing. Requesting backup from all available security personnel. Subjects appear to be armed.

Security: There they are! Don’t let them get away.

[Lucy takes the baton from one of the guards and skilfully knocks them both out.]

Desmond Miles: Holy shit… Look at this place… What about the cameras?

Lucy Stillman: I rigged them to loop old footage. How do you think I managed to hide all your nighttime snooping from Abstergo?

Desmond Miles: You’re good…

Lucy Stillman: So I’ve been told. But they’re onto us now. We need to hurry. Careful… We need to get to that elevator on the other side of the room. Follow my lead. But keep an eye out for security. I’d rather avoid a fight.

[They run past several enclosed areas with Animus.]

Desmond Miles: Is that an Animus?

Lucy Stillman: Wait… Stay with me…

Desmond Miles: What the… How many of them are there?

Lucy Stillman: Careful…

Desmond Miles: Is it Animus-es? Or Animi? What do you think, Lucy? Lucy? What do they need with all of them?

Lucy Stillman: Desmond. Shut. the. fuck. up. Please. (trying to open the elevator) Fuck! I thought this card would work. It must be on a separate system and I don’t have the code.

Desmond Miles: Wait…

[He uses his “assassin vision” and sees the most used button combinations.]

Desmond Miles: Shit! Oh come on!

[He enters the right combination.]

Lucy Stillman: How did you do that?

Desmond Miles: I don’t know.

Lucy Stillman: Let’s go. (they enter the elevator) It’s always something…

Desmond Miles: What was that in the Animus? Subject Sixteen? Ezio… Audi… Audisomething?

Lucy Stillman: I think we’ve been wrong all along. That’s why we need to get out of here. Vidic and the Templars - they’re only part of the problem…

Desmond Miles: What do you mean?

Lucy Stillman: I’ll explain when we get there.

Desmond Miles: Get where?

[They go down to the parking lot where the guards with batons are already waiting for them. A big fight begins. Desmond and Lucy kick their asses.]

Lucy Stillman: (opens her car’s trunk) Get in.

Desmond Miles: You’re joking?

Lucy Stillman: It’s for your own protection. We’re almost there…

[They drive for a while.]

Desmond Miles: Thanks for that. It was great…being shoved in the trunk, bouncing around. Loved it.

Lucy Stillman: This way.

Desmond Miles: So…gonna tell me what’s going on now?

Lucy Stillman: There was a reason for the escape, Desmond.

Desmond Miles: Figures.

Lucy Stillman: We need your help.

Desmond Miles: For what? Another treasure hunt through time?

Lucy Stillman: Abstergo’s gonna replace their Apple of Eden. The map your ancestor found guarantees it. The other Assassins… They’ll do what they can, where they can. But…

Desmond Miles: What…what is it?

Lucy Stillman: We’re losing this war, Desmond. The Templars are too powerful and every day more of us die…

Desmond Miles: I still don’t see how I fit into things…

Lucy Stillman: We’re going to train you, turn you into one of us.

Desmond Miles: What?! No, no…you’ve seen me in action - I’m no good at this. And even if I was… It would take months - years, even.

Lucy Stillman: No. Not with the Animus. Not with the bleeding effect.

Desmond Miles: But I’m just one guy…

Lucy Stillman: Sometimes that’s all you need.

Desmond Miles: So that’s why you found him… My ancestor. What was his name? Ezio?

Lucy Stillman: If you can follow in his footsteps, you’ll learn everything he did - just like he did. Years of training absorbed in a matter of days.

Desmond Miles: You broke me out of Abstergo and brought me here just to make me an Assassin?

Lucy Stillman: Look there’s more to it than that, but it’ll have to wait. Trust me, okay?

Desmond Miles: Alright, I’m in. Tell me what you need.

Lucy Stillman: Really? You’re sure?

Desmond Miles: I thought you’d be happy about this.

Lucy Stillman: Sorry… I’m just a little surprised. I spent the whole ride over here figuring out how I was going to convince you to do this…

Desmond Miles: Save it. After what those Templar bastards put me through. I’m ready, willing, and able.

[Lucy hugs Desmond.]

Lucy Stillman: Thank you.

[They enter the next room. There is a girl sitting at the computer. She jumps from her chair and runs to Lucy.]

Headphone Girl: Lucy! You made it! God! It’s been so long! Seven years! Can you believe it?!

A Guy with the Glasses: Indeed. Welcome back. Ah, so this must be the infamous subject seventeen… Desmond Miles was it?

Desmond Miles: Who are you?

A Guy with the Glasses: I’m sorry… Where are my manners? I’m Shaun Hastings - this is Rebecca Crane.

Rebecca Crane: Nice to meet you, Desmond.

Shaun Hastings: Right, well it’s been lovely chatting, but if you don’t mind, Desmond, it’s best we get straight to work. Time is precious. Doubly so these days.

Rebecca Crane: We’ve got everything set up and ready, Lucy. Just say the word and we’ll get going.

Lucy Stillman: Here. I brought you something. A parting gift from Abstergo.

[She gives her the disk.]

Rebecca Crane: Whoa! The memory core! This is amazing! With their data, things are gonna go a lot faster! I’ll get to work on merging the code… (leaves)

[Desmond walks to her.]

Rebecca Crane: Hey Desmond! What’s up?

Desmond Miles: Just wondering what your role is in all this.

Rebecca Crane: I take care of Baby. It’s my job to keep her up and running.

Desmond Miles: Baby? You mean the Animus.

Rebecca Crane: Actually, I prefer Animus two-point-oh, since Baby’s twice as awesome as anything you’ll find at Abstergo. The Templars might have deeper pockets than us, but they’ve got no ambition. No passion! No competitive edge! That’s why, even with all their resources, anything they can do, I can do better. Faster too! Anyway, take a seat when you’re ready, and we can get started. I just need to make a few more adjustments…

[Desmond walks to Lucy.]

Desmond Miles: Hey… Listen. I just wanted to say thank you. And that I’m sorry

Lucy Stillman: Sorry?

Desmond Miles: Ya you know, before. Everything at Abstergo. It was just… I wasn’t ready.

Lucy Stillman: It’s okay.

Desmond Miles: No. Going through all that. Knowing that the Templars still exist. What they’re planning…

Lucy Stillman: What’s done is done, Desmond. You’re here now and that’s what matters.

[Desmond walks to Shaun.]

Desmond Miles: What’s all this stuff for?

Shaun Hastings: This stuff, Desmond, oh this stuff is nothing special, really, this stuff is just the stuff that keeps our entire operation from falling apart, really. It requires a great deal of concentration to keep it all moving, so you’ll forgive me if I don’t have time to play meet and greet.

Rebecca Crane: Shaun’s in charge of maintaining our knowledge archives - it’s like a digital library. He’ll be riding shotgun with me while you’re in the Animus. So if you come across anything of note - people, places, events, etcetera - he’ll create database entries you can consult for additional information.

Shaun Hastings: Y-yeah, it’s not just databases, though. I also provide tactical support for the other Assassins. You know, Desmond, the ones who are out there - actually doing stuff. Risking their lives, little things like that.

[Desmond lies in Animus 2.0 that looks like a dentist chair.]

Desmond Miles: So how does this work?

Shaun Hastings: There will be time enough for that - later.

Nightcap
[Ezio jumps off the building into a haystack.]

Federico Auditore: Cazzo (Fuck), it’s Vieri! I’d better hide.

Vieri de’ Pazzi: Keep looking! He couldn’t have gotten far…

[Ezio runs to the house of his beloved.]

Ezio Auditore: Cristina… Cristina!

Cristina: Who’s there?

Ezio Auditore: Me!

Cristina: Ezio! I should have known.

Ezio Auditore: May I come in?

Cristina: Fine. But only for a minute.

Ezio Auditore: A minute is all I need.

Cristina: Indeed.

Ezio Auditore: (to himself) Wait… That came out wrong.

[He climbs to Cristina’s room on the second floor.]

Ezio Auditore: Come here.

Cristina: Oh, Ezio…

[They kiss and they have some quality time together. The next morning…]

Cristina’s Father: Cristina! Cristina! Sveglia! (Wake up!) Your tutor will be here soon! Come, my daughter… is it really so terrible tha— Figlio d’un cane! (Son of a bitch!) What is this?!

Ezio Auditore: Perdonate, Messere! Chiedo venia! (Forgive me, sir! I beg your pardon!)

Cristina’s Father: I kill you!

[Ezio jumps off the window.]

Ezio Auditore: Now, now! That’s not necessary…

Cristina’s Father: Guards! Guards! Voglio la sua testa! (Bring me his head!)

Ezio Auditore: There’s really no need for violence…

[He runs.]

Ezio Auditore: You have me confused with someone else… She needed some help… with… some things… I’m mostly innocent!

[He manages to hide from the guards. “Nightcap” synchronized. Ezio goes home and meets his father on the doorstep.]

Ezio Auditore: Good morning, father.

Giovanni Auditore: Come with me.

Ezio Auditore: Is something wrong?

Giovanni Auditore: Do you think me blind and deaf, son? I know all about your fight with Vieri de’ Pazzi last night. And then this little visit to Cristina! Your behavior is unacceptable! It… it… (smiles) It reminds me of myself when I was your age! I assume these misadventures won’t interfere with your work today?

Ezio Auditore: No, padre. Avete la mia parola. (No, father. You have my word.)

[A jump in time. Ezio and his father are standing in the room.]

Giovanni Auditore: I’ve prepared some documents here for Lorenzo de’ Medici to review. I need them delivered to him.

Ezio Auditore: With haste, father.

Giovanni Auditore: Return to me when it’s done.

Paperboy
[Ezio delivers the letter and hides from the Pazzi.]

Man: Ah! Ezio! Ben trovato! (Well met!) How are you?

Ezio Auditore: Come sempre. (Same as ever.) I have a letter for Messer Lorenzo.

Man: I’ll see that he receives it when he returns.

Ezio Auditore: Returns?

Man: They’ve gone to Villa Careggi, I’m afraid. And not expected back for at least another day.

Ezio Auditore: I’ll let my father know.

[Ezio returns to his father. He sees his brother near the door.]

Frederico Auditore: Keep up the good work!

Ezio Auditore: Bischero! (Penis!)

[He accidentally overhears his father’s conversation with a friend.]

Geovanni’s Friend: …You worry too much, Giovanni. Francesco de’ Pazzi is in prison. The threat is ended.

Giovanni Auditore: Ah! Hello son. You remember my friend Uberto?

Ezio Auditore: Good morning, Gonfaloniere Alberti.

Uberto Alberti: To you as well, young man.

Giovanni Auditore: I trust you delivered the message?

Ezio Auditore: Si, padre. (Yes, father.) But it seems Lorenzo is out of town.

Giovanni Auditore: Hmm. I did not anticipate this…

Uberto Alberti: What does it matter. So you wait another day or two.

Giovanni Auditore: Listen, your mother and sister have been looking for you. I’ll need you again in a little while, but for now - see if you can’t help them.

Ezio Auditore: Are you sure?

Giovanni Auditore: Yes. Now, if you’ll excuse us…?

Uberto Alberti: Good to see you, Ezio.

[“Paperboy” synchronized. Ezio leaves the house and sits on the bench with his sister, Claudia.]

Claudia Auditore: Ehi Ezio! (Hey Ezio!)

Ezio Auditore: Ehi Claudia. (Hey Claudia.) How are you?

Claudia Auditore: Bene… (Okay…)

Ezio Auditore: You shouldn’t keep things from me.

Claudia Auditore: It’s Duccio.

Ezio Auditore: What of him?

Claudia Auditore: I think he’s been… unfaithful.

Ezio Auditore: Who told you this?

Claudia Auditore: The other girls. I thought they were my friends. (cries)

Ezio Auditore: Harpies! You’re better off without them.

Claudia Auditore: (innocently) I loved him.

Ezio Auditore: No, Claudia. You only thought you did.

Claudia Auditore: (aggressively) He should suffer for what he’s done.

Ezio Auditore: Wait here. I’ll go have a word with him.

Beat a Cheat
[Ezio finds Duccio with some fat girl.]

Fat Girl: (looking at a ring) Oh, Duccio! It’s beautiful!

Duccio: Nothing but the best for you, amore mio (my love).

Fat Girl: But… what of Claudia? I thought you’d been promised to her?

Duccio: Father said I could do much better than an Auditore.

[He slaps her ass. She pushes him.]

Fat Girl: Birbante! (Naughty!) Come, let us walk a bit.

Duccio: Walk? (grabs her) I had something else in mind…

Fat Girl: Oh Duccio…

[They kiss. Ezio approaches.]

Ezio Auditore: Ehi, lurido porco! (Hey, dirty pig!)

Duccio: Ezio, my friend!

Ezio Auditore: You insult my sister, parading around with this puttana. (whore)

[Insulted fat girl leaves.]

Duccio: Wh-what are you talking about?!

Ezio Auditore: I saw the gift you gave her. Heard the things you said.

Duccio: Maybe your sister shouldn’t be so stingy with her virtù… (virtue…)

Ezio Auditore: You broke her heart.

Duccio: (laughs) And now I’m going to break your face!

[They fight.]

Duccio: You Auditores all talk big - but when it comes time for action? Hah! You’ll regret ever opening your mouth could have taught your sister a great many things! She’s lucky to have had someone like me!

Ezio Auditore: Bastardo!

Duccio: Basta! Mi arrendo! (Stop! I yield)

Ezio Auditore: Stay away from my sister!

[“Beat a Cheat” synchronized. Down the street Ezio meets his younger brother, Petruccio.]

Petruccio’s Secret
Petruccio Auditore: Ehi Ezio! (Hey Ezio!)

Ezio Auditore: What are you doing out here, Petruccio? You should be in bed.

Petruccio Auditore: I want those feathers.

Ezio Auditore: What for?

Petruccio Auditore: It’s a secret.

Ezio Auditore: If I get them for you, will you go back inside?

Petruccio Auditore: Yes. I promise.

[Ezio gets the feathers and gets back home.]

Ezio Auditore: Here. As promised.

Petruccio Auditore: Grazie (Thank you), brother!

Ezio Auditore: You still haven’t told me why you want these.

Petruccio Auditore: I will. In time.

[“Petruccio’s Secret” synchronized. Ezio finds his mother in the garden.]

Friend of the Family
Maria Auditore: Buon giorno (Hello), Ezio!

Ezio Auditore: Buon giorno a voi, madre. Come state? (Hello mother. How are you?)

Maria Auditore: Sto bene! (I’m good!) And you? Still recovering from last night?

Ezio Auditore: I have no idea what you’re talking about.

Maria Auditore: Of course not. Anyway, I have an errand to run. I’d like you to join me.

Ezio Auditore: Con piacere. (With pleasure.)

Maria Auditore: Come. It’s not far from here.

[Ezio follows his mother.]

Maria Auditore: I know about your fight with Vieri…

Ezio Auditore: What fight?

Maria Auditore: Per placere (Please), let’s not play this game.

Ezio Auditore: He spoke ill of us. I could not allow him to continue.

Maria Auditore: I’m sure he’s having a hard time dealing with the accusations against his father. Francesco de’ Pazzi is many things - and none of them good. But even I never suspected he’d be capable of murder.

Ezio Auditore: What will happen to him?

Maria Auditore: I imagine there will be a trial.

Ezio Auditore: Will father speak at it?

Maria Auditore: He’ll have to. He’s the one with the evidence.

Ezio Auditore: Still, I wish there was another way.

Maria Auditore: You’ve nothing to fear. Everyone wants justice done. It is an unfortunate state of affairs, but it will pass. Here we are.

[She knocks at the door of some workshop.]

Maria Auditore: Hello Leonardo.

Leonardo da Vinci: Madonna Maria! (kisses her)

Maria Auditore: This is my son, Ezio.

Leonardo da Vinci: (bows) Molto onorato. (It’s a pleasure to meet you.)

Ezio Auditore: (bows) L’onore è mio. (The honor is mine.)

Leonardo da Vinci: Let me go and fetch the paintings. I’ll be right back.

[He goes back to his workshop.]

Maria Auditore: He’s very talented.

Ezio Auditore: Immagino. (I guess.)

Maria Auditore: Self expression is vital to understanding and enjoying life. You should find an outlet.

Ezio Auditore: I have plenty of outlets.

Maria Auditore: I meant besides vaginas.

Ezio Auditore: Mother!

Leonardo da Vinci: Back to your house, then?

Maria Auditore: Si. Si. (Yes. Yes.) Ezio, help Leonardo, will you?

[Ezio picks up the box that Lanardo brought.]

Leonardo da Vinci: So, Ezio, what do you do?

Maria Auditore: He’s been working for his father.

Leonardo da Vinci: Ah! You’re to be a banker?

Ezio Auditore: For now. And you? Art, was it?

Leonardo da Vinci: Truth be told, it’s been difficult for me to settle. Painting is nice, but often I feel like my work lacks… I don’t know… purpose. Does that make sense? I’d rather contribute more practically. More directly. Architecture, perhaps. Or know… purpose. Does that make sense? I’d rather contribute more practically. More directly. Architecture, perhaps. Or anatomy. I’m not content to merely capture the world. I want to change anatomy. I’m not content to merely capture the world. I want to change it.

Maria Auditore: Oh Leonardo! I have no doubt you’ll go on to do great things!

Leonardo da Vinci: Vi ringrazio, Madonna. (I thank you.) That’s kind of you.

Maria Auditore: Thank you for the help, son. Don’t let me keep you from your other duties.

Leonardo da Vinci: It was nice to meet you, Ezio. I hope our paths cross again.

Ezio Auditore: Anch’io. (Me too.)

[“Friend of the Family” synchronized.]

Special Delivery
[Ezio enters his house.]

Giovanni Auditore: Ezio! Come in, son. I need these packages delivered to associates of mine in the city. I also need you to retrieve a message for me from a pigeon coop not too far from here.

Ezio Auditore: Va bene. (Okay.) I’ll get it done.

Giovanni Auditore: Come back here when you’re finished. There are some things we need to discuss. And please, my son, stay out of trouble, hmm?

[Ezio goes to fulfill the first errand.]

Man on the Roof: Here. Over here.

Ezio Auditore: I have a delivery from—

Man on the Roof: —Giovanni Auditore?

Ezio Auditore: Yes.

Man on the Roof: Were you followed?

Ezio Auditore: No… Why would I be followed?

Man on the Roof: Give me the package. Tell your father that they’re moving tonight. He should as well.

Ezio Auditore: Who’s moving? What’s going on here? Wait! Come back! Explain yourself!

[The man runs away. After sending a message with pigeons, Ezio goes to fulfill the last errand.]

Ugly Man: You Giovanni’s kid?

Woman: No idiota (idiot). He just happens to look EXACTLY like the man.

Ugly Man: Give it here.

[Ezio carefully hands out an envelope to the Ugly Man, stretching out his hand.]

Ugly Man: Don’t worry boy, we’re not contagious. Least I’m not… (the woman pushes him)

[“Special Delivery” synchronized. Ezio goes back home.]

Ezio Auditore: Father? Federico?

[The maid attacks him from behind.]

Maid: Ser Ezio! (Sir Ezio!) I’m sorry! I’m so sorry!

Ezio Auditore: What happened? Where is everyone?

Maid: They took your father and brothers to the Palazzo della Signoria - to prison!

Ezio Auditore: And my mother? My sister?

Claudia Auditore: Ezio…

[They hug.]

Ezio Auditore: Claudia! Are you alright?

Claudia Auditore: Yes. But mother…

Maid: She’s in shock. They… When she resisted…

Ezio Auditore: It’s not safe here. Is there someplace you can take them?

Maid: Yes. Yes! To my sister’s.

Ezio Auditore: Good. Do that. In the meantime I’ll go see my father.

Maid: Be careful, Messer Ezio! The guards were looking for you as well.

Jailbird
[Ezio hides from the guards and climbs to his father’s cell.]

Giovanni Auditore: Ezio!

Ezio Auditore: Father! What’s happened?

Giovanni Auditore: Took a bit of beating, but I’m alright. What of your mother and sister?

Ezio Auditore: Safe now.

Giovanni Auditore: Annetta took them?

Ezio Auditore: Yes… Wait. You knew this would happen?!

Giovanni Auditore: Not the way it did… and not this soon. It doesn’t matter now.

Ezio Auditore: What do you mean? Explain!

Giovanni Auditore: There’s no time! Listen closely: Return to the house. In my office is a hidden door. Use your talent to find it. Beyond lies a chest. Take EVERYTHING you find inside. Much of it may seem strange to you, but all of it is important. Do you understand?

Ezio Auditore: Yes.

Giovanni Auditore: Good. Among the contents is a letter - and with it some documents. I need you to take these documents to Messer Uberto. He was with me in the office this morning.

Ezio Auditore: The Gonfaloniere. I remember. Now please - tell me what’s happening. Are the Pazzi behind this? There was a note for you at the pigeon coop. It sai—

[From the depths of the dungeon, a door rumbles.]

Giovanni Auditore: Go Ezio! Go now!

[“Jailbird” synchronized. Ezio returns to his home and finds the secret room.]

Family Heirloom
Ezio Auditore: Father said there was a door here…

[In the chest by the window, he finds an expensive white suit with a hood and a cuff with a retractable blade. Also in the chest there is a letter. Ezio wears the costume.]

Ezio Auditore: I need to bring this to Messer Uberto.

[When he enters the yard, he encounters several guards.]

Guard: Traditore! (Traitor!)

Ezio Auditore: Hey! What’s with the swords? Aren’t you supposed to arrest me?

Guard: No.

Ezio Auditore: What do you want, then?

Guard: For you to die.

Ezio Auditore: Well, that’s not going to happen. So why don’t we explore other options?

Guard: There are no other options.

[Ezio kills them. He runs to the Umberto house and knocks on the door. You can see confusion on Ezio’s face. His whole world collapses right before his eyes.]

Uberto Alberti: Ezio Auditore? What are you doing here at this hour?

Ezio Auditore: It… I don’t…

Uberto Alberti: Wait, child. Take a breath. Collect your thoughts.

Ezio Auditore: My father and brothers have been imprisoned. I was told to bring you this.

[He gives Umberto the letter.]

Uberto Alberti: Ahh. I see now. It’s a misunderstanding, Ezio. I’ll clear everything up.

Ezio Auditore: How?

Uberto Alberti: The documents you’ve given me contain evidence of a conspiracy against your family and against the city. I’ll present these papers at their hearing in the morning and they’ll be released.

Ezio Auditore: Thank you, Signore (sir).

Uberto Alberti: Of course, my child. Do you need a place to stay? You’re more than welcome here.

Ezio Auditore: No grazie. (No thank you) I’ll meet you at the piazza (square).

Uberto Alberti: Don’t worry, Ezio. Everything is going to be fine.

[“Family Heirloom” synchronized.]

Last Man Standing
[Ezio comes out on the square to attend the acquittal. His father Giovanni, brother Frederico and little Petruccio stand with their hands tied behind their backs on the scaffold. Next to them, Umberto stands and gives a speech in front of the crowd.]

Uberto Alberti: Giovanni Auditore, you and your accomplices stand accused of the crime of treason. Have you any evidence to counter this charge?

Giovanni Auditore: Yes. The documents that were delivered to you last night!

Uberto Alberti: I’m afraid I know nothing of these documents.

Ezio Auditore: (screams) He’s lying! (to himself) I need to get closer!

Uberto Alberti: In the absence of any compelling evidence to the contrary, I am bound to pronounce you GUILTY. You and your collaborators are hereby sentenced to DEATH.

Giovanni Auditore: (aggressively) YOU are the traitor, Uberto - And one of THEM! You may take our lives this day - but WE WILL have yours in return. I swear! We wil—

[All three members of the Auditore family are executed. Ezio runs to the scaffold.]

Ezio Auditore: FATHER!

Uberto Alberti: There! Grab the boy! He’s one of them!

[The guards grab Ezio.]

Ezio Auditore: (screams) I’LL KILL YOU FOR WHAT YOU’VE DONE!

Uberto Alberti: Guards! Arrest him!

[A large knight, clad in golden armor, knocks the sword out of Ezio’s hands.]

Uberto Alberti: Abbattetelo! (Put him down!)

Ugly Man: You’d better run, boy. And fast!

[And Ezio runs. “Last Man Standing” synchronized. Memory Sequence 1 completed.]

Shaun Hastings: (offscreen) I’ve got a little request for you. I’ve identified several strange markings that I’ve discovered right across Renaissance Italy. Now, I don’t know what they’re doing there, but I want you to help me find out. Rebecca has marked their general Italy. Now, I don’t know what they’re doing there, but I want you to help me find out. Rebecca has marked their general location in the database with an eve icon and she’s made them glow as well. Keep an eye out.

Memory Sequence 02: Escape Plans
[Auditore’s maid, Annetta, runs to Ezio.]

Annetta: Ser Ezio, thank God! I’ve been looking everywhere for you.

Ezio Auditore: I… I couldn’t stop them, Annetta. I tried, I swear! But there were so many guards…

Annetta: Please. Come with me. We need to get you off the streets.

Ezio Auditore: What of my mother and sister?

Annetta: They’re safe. I’ll bring you to them.

Ezio Auditore: No! It’s too dangerous for us to travel together. Tell me where to go and I’ll meet you there.

Annetta: My sister’s house, just north of the Duomo.

Ezio Auditore: I’m on my way.

[Ezio finds Annetta’s sister “house”. It’s a brothel. Young Ezio opens his mouth in amusement.]

Ezio Auditore: I think we have the wrong building…

Annetta: No, no. This is it.

Mistress of the Brothel: It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Messer Ezio… Annetta speaks quite highly of you. I can see why.

Ezio Auditore: I appreciate the kind words Madonna…?

Mistress of the Brothel: Ti prego (Please), call me Paola.

Ezio Auditore: Thank you for offering your home to my family, Paola.

Paola: It was the least I could do. You must be tired. Perhaps you’d li-

Ezio Auditore: No, grazie. (No thank you.) I can’t stay.

Paola: Why? Where are you going?

Ezio Auditore: To kill Uberto Alberti.

Paola: I understand your desire for vengeance, but The Gonfaloniere is a powerful man. You’re not a killer, Ezio.

Ezio Auditore: Spare me the lecture.

Paola: But I can make you one.

Ezio Auditore: And why are you going to teach me how to kill?

Paola: I’m not. I’m going to teach you how to survive. Come.

Fitting In
Paola: Discretion is paramount in my profession. We must walk the streets freely: seen, but unseen. You too must learn to blend like us, and become one with the city’s crowds. My girls will show you how…

[Ezio tries to blend in with the prostitutes. I don’t know how to comment on that…]

Prostitute: We’ll take good care of you…

[Ezio blends in with the crowd leaving the guards’ sight.]

Paola: Bene! Now that you’ve learned to blend, I’ll show you how to use it for more than just moving around. Let’s teach you how to steal.

[Ezio tries to steal and fails.]

Prostitute: Thief! Thief!

Paola: Once you’ve stolen from someone Ezio, you mustn’t linger.

Prostitute: Help! Somebody stop him!

[Developing his skills, Ezio robbed 5 different people in the streets. “Fitting In” synchronized.]

Ace Up My Sleeve
Paola: You can go now, girls.

Prostitute: Do we have to?

Prostitute 2: So innocent…

Prostitute 3: He’s cute…

[Prostitutes leave.]

Paola: Now that you’ve learned how to approach the enemy. we need to find you a suitable weapon.

Ezio Auditore: What would you have me use?

Paola: Ah, but you already have the answer…

Ezio Auditore: Hey! My father’s blade and bracer… How did you get them?

Paola: (laugh) By using the same skills I’ve just taught you.

Ezio Auditore: It’s not exactly in working condition.

Paola: I assume you are familiar with Leonardo da Vinci?

Ezio Auditore: Si. (Yes.) But how does a painter fit into this?

Paola: He’s far more than that. Bring him the pieces. You’ll see.

Ezio Auditore: Before I go, one last question - if I may?

Paola: Of course.

Ezio Auditore: Why have you given your aid so readily to me, a stranger?

[She rolls her sleeve and shows Ezio burns on the arm.]

Paola: I too know betrayal.

[Ezio vist’s Leonardo’s workshop.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Oh! Ezio Auditore! …I didn’t expect to see YOU again. What with all that’s happened… Ah! Where are my manners! Welcome back! (hugs Ezio) Now, how can I be of service?

Ezio Auditore: I was hoping you could repair something of mine.

Leonardo da Vinci: Of course! Come! This way. Ah, che pasticcio… Tutto il santo giorno che cerco… (Oh, what a mess… I’ve spent the whole day looking for…) Let me clear a space. Alright, let’s see it!

[Ezio hands Leonardo his broken hidden blade.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Fascinating… I don’t know, Ezio. Despite its age, the construction is rather advanced. I’ve never seen anything quite like it. I’m afraid there’s not much I can do without the original plans… Mi dispiace. (I’m sorry.) Wait, wait, wait!

Ezio Auditore: What are you doing?

Leonardo da Vinci: The contents of this page are encrypted! But if my theory is correct… Based on these sketches it may very well…

Ezio Auditore: It may very well what?

Leonardo da Vinci: Please, sit!

Ezio Auditore: Leonardo?

Leonardo da Vinci: Shhhh! Remarkable! If we transpose the letters and then select every third… (jump in time) There! It’s finished!

Ezio Auditore: Hmm? What’s finished?

Leonardo da Vinci: The blade! I managed to decode that parchment of yours. It showed me exactly what to do. Now all that’s left is to remove your ring finger.

Ezio Auditore: Really?

Leonardo da Vinci: I’m sorry, but this is how it must be done. The blade is designed to ensure the "commitment" of whoever wields it.

Ezio Auditore: (puts his finger on the table) Bene. (Fine) Do it quickly.

[Leonardo pretends to cut off Ezio’s finger.]

Leonardo da Vinci: I was only having fun, Ezio! Though the blade once required a sacrifice, it’s been modified. You can keep your finger.

Ezio Auditore: (examines the hidden blade) Incredible…

Leonardo da Vinci: Yes it is! Tell me: Do you have other pages like this?

Ezio Auditore: I’m sorry, only the one.

Leonardo da Vinci: Listen - if you ever do happen across another one of these - please - bring it to me.

Ezio Auditore: You have my word. And thank you for fixing this. It-

[Someone knocks at the door.]

Guard: By order of the Florentine guard: Open this door!

Leonardo da Vinci: Eh, just a moment! (to Ezio) Wait here!

[He walks to the door.]

Guard: Are you Leonardo da Vinci?

Leonardo da Vinci: Si. (Yes) How may I be of service?

Guard: I need you to answer some questions.

Leonardo da Vinci: Certainly.

[He leaves with the guards.]

Leonardo da Vinci: What seems to be the trouble?

Guard: A witness claims to have seen you consorting with an enemy of the city.

Leonardo da Vinci: What? Me? Consorting? Prepostorous!

Guard: When was the last time you saw or spoke with Ezio Auditore?

Leonardo da Vinci: Who?

Guard: Non fare il finto tonto. (Don’t play dumb with me.) We know you were close with the family. Hmm. (pushes Leonardo) Perhaps this will help to clear your head? (kicks him) Ready to talk? What about now?

[Ezio assassinates the guard.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Grazie (Thank you) Ezio!

Ezio Auditore: Sorry about that.

Leonardo da Vinci: Eh. I’ve grown accustomed to their abuses.

Ezio Auditore: What of the body?

Leonardo da Vinci: Bring it inside and put it with the others.

Ezio Auditore: Others?

Leonardo da Vinci: The city gives them to me. For research.

[Ezio carries the body to Leonardo’s morgue.]

Leonardo da Vinci: See? Like it never happened!

Ezio Auditore: Thank you, Leonardo - for everything.

Leonardo da Vinci: Any time! And remember - if you find more of those strange pages, bring them to me. Should they contain new designs, I will upgrade your blade as well!

Ezio Auditore: Of course. Now I really should be getting back to Paola…

Leonardo da Vinci: Porgile i miei omaggi! (Send her my regards!)

[“Ace In My Sleeve” synchronized. Ezio returns to Paola’s brothel.]

Judge, Jury, Executioner
Paola: You were gone for quite a while.

Ezio Auditore: Leonardo likes to talk.

Paola: That he does. But I trust you did more than talk? (Ezio shows her the hidden blade) I’ve given you the skills. Leonardo’s given you the blade. All that remains is the deed.

Ezio Auditore: Where can I find Uberto?

Paola: According to my girls, he’ll be attending an unveiling tonight of Verrocchio’s latest work. It will be held at the Santa Croce cloister.

Ezio Auditore: Watch over my mother and sister while I’m away

Paola: Of course, Ezio. As if they were my own.

[Ezio visits the show at Santa Croce to find Umberto. He climbs on the roof and overhears his conversation with someone.]

Uberto Alberti: Again with this?

Man: You have overstepped your bounds, Uberto.

Uberto Alberti: Who are you to speak of bounds? You, who have crowned yourself Lorenzo de’ Medici, Principe (Prince) of Firenze.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: I’ve done no such thing.

Uberto Alberti: Of course not. Ever innocent. How convenient. At least now we see how far your reach extends - which is to say - nowhere at all. It has proved a valuable lesson for me and my allies.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Yes. Your allies the Pazzi. Is that what this is about?

Uberto Alberti: Be careful with your words, Lorenzo. You might attract the wrong sort of attention.

[Ezio follows Umberto undetected.]

Man: Good evening Gonfaloniere.

Uberto Alberti: To you as well. I trust you’re enjoying yourselves?

Man: Indeed! A nice distraction from that nasty business with the Auditore family.

Uberto Alberti: And to think I once thought of Giovanni as a brother…

Man: Don’t blame yourself! How could you have known what evils he planned?

Woman: I say we strike that traitor’s name from the record books. Let history forget he ever even existed.

Uberto Alberti: Hmmm. Yes. I should look into that. If you’ll excuse me for a moment…

Young Girl: Uberto! A moment of your time?

Uberto Alberti: Anything for you, Beatrice.

Beatrice: So! Tell us! How does it feel to be a hero?

Uberto Alberti: Please, I am no such thing. As Gonfaloniere it is my duty to ensure that the city of Firenze remains a shining beacon of justice. Corruption and its ilk shall find no purchase here so long as I am in control.

Beatrice: You are a treasure, Uberto! I hope Lorenzo recognizes that!

[Ezio joins the party.]

Uberto Alberti: You… Guards! Arrest him!

[Ezio assassinates him in front of his friends.]

Uberto Alberti: (dying) You would have done the same. To save the ones you love.

Ezio Auditore: Yes. I would. And I have. (to the crowd) The Auditore are not dead. I’m still here. ME! Ezio! Ezio Auditore!

Girl: Assassino!

[Ezio climbs into the building and disappears. “Judge, Jury, Executioner” synchronized. Ezio finds an Omega symbol on the top of a building.]

Shaun Hastings: (in Ezio’s head) There’s one of the symbols! What does it mean? I must be there for a reason. Can you take a closer look? Hey! Try using Eagle Vision.

Rebecca Crane: (in Ezio’s head) Wait that’s not possible. This can’t be… hold on, that’s computer code. Let me compile it… aww shit, it’s an encrypted file!

Shaun Hastings: (in Ezio’s head) Upload it to my computer! I’m a master at decryption.

Rebecca Crane: (in Ezio’s head) I can’t, it’s only compatible with the Animus itself.

Shaun Hastings: (in Ezio’s head) Up-Upload it to Desmond then… I can’t believe this.

[Rebecca uploads the code and Desmond hears a voice.]

Voice: Hello. This is… they call me Subject Sixteen. Listen, I don’t have much time. There’s something I have to show you. We’ve been lied to this whole time. Everything we know, everything we’ve been brought up to believe. It’s wrong. Okay, umm… I’ve uploaded the evidence, the file, that proves it all. But I’ve split it into twenty pieces and locked each with a code. Can’t be too careful, Queen Isabella… no, not her, hmm… what century is it? Umm… nevermind. I’ve hidden the code to the first file inside this program. Find it -- find them all -- and along the way you’ll begin to see the truth.

Shaun Hastings: (in Ezio’s head) What the he-! How did this get inside our animus?

Rebecca Crane: (in Ezio’s head) Oh. Oh. The Memory Core, we transferred Sixteen’s Memory Data from Abstergo into the Animus 2.0. He must have hacked the machine when Vidic left him alone between sessions.

Desmond Miles: (in Ezio’s head) Hold on, wait a second… The signs on the walls in Abstergo… The ones written in blood. Those were clues! He was telling us to look for them inside the Animus!

[He unlocks the code and gets a fraction of The Truth, after which, as Ezio, knocks at Paola’s brothel door.]

Laying Low
Ezio Auditore: I think it’s best I leave Firenze.

Paola: Where will you go?

Ezio Auditore: My uncle Mario owns a villa near Monteriggioni.

Paola: You’re still a wanted man, Ezio.

Ezio Auditore: What would you have me do, then?

Paola: I’ve seen posters all across the district. Tearing them down will help the city forget your face. No doubt the heralds also incite the public. Bribe them and they’ll speak of other things. Or you could hunt those who bear false witness against you. They traded dignity for coin. Their loss would not be mourned. Do any of these things and you should be free to leave.

Rebecca Crane: (in Ezio’s head) I’ve added a program for tracking notoriety. This little meter will help you know how far you are between notorious and incognito. This will help you know if you should watch your actions. It’ll also tell you if the Notoriety level is part of Ezio’s memory or not.

[Ezio tears down the posters and hands out bribes, and then returns to Paola. “Laying Low” synchronized.]

Arrivederci
Paola: Bentornato Ezio. (Welcome back). Were you successful?

Ezio Auditore: Yes.

[Paola claps her hands.]

Paola: Madre? (Mother?)

Claudia Auditore: Ezio! Where have you been?! They wouldn’t let us leave. And mother… Uch! She hasn’t spoken a single word since we left the house. Father will need to sort things out… Where is father? And Federico? and Petruccio? Hmmm?

Ezio Auditore: Something’s happened.

Claudia Auditore: What do you mean? No. It’s impossible!

Ezio Auditore: Claudia…

Claudia Auditore: No, no, no, no, no.

Ezio Auditore: I did everything I could, piccina (little one)…

[Claudia turns around and starts crying. Ezio hugs her.]

Ezio Auditore: Listen right now what matters is getting us all someplace safe. But to do that, I need you to stay focused. Do you understand? (Claudia nods) Good. Will you watch over mother for me? Then we are ready. Thank you again, for everything.

Paola: Stay safe, Ezio. Stay vigilant. I suspect the road ahead is yet long.

[Exio escorts Maria and Claudia out of Florence to the Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni.]

Claudia Auditore: How could this have happened to us… Will we ever be back?

Ezio Auditore: I don’t know.

Claudia Auditore: What will happen to our house…

Ezio Auditore: I don’t know!

Claudia Auditore: Were they… Were they given a proper burial?

Ezio Auditore: Yes. They were…

[Ezio continues to escort Maria and Claudia.]

TOSCANA
1476

Ezio Auditore: We should be close.

Claudia Auditore: Grazie a Dio. (Thank God.)

[They stumble upon Vieri de Pazzi and his men.]

Vieri de Pazzi: Buon giorno (Good day) Ezio! How could you leave Firenze without saying a proper goodbye? Ezio…

Ezio Auditore: What do you want, Vieri?

Vieri de Pazzi: So many things! A larger palazzo, two new steeds, a prettier bride… Oh and yes… your life. (pulls out a sword and they fight) My condolences for the loss of your father and brothers! What will happen now that there’s no one left to help you? I have such wonderful things in store for your mother and sister! I grow tired of this game. Finish him. And do not spare the women.

[Someone knocks a sword out of his hands with a stone I believe.]

Vieri de Pazzi: What sorcery is this?!

Voice: Not sorcery, boy. Skill.

Vieri de Pazzi: Show yourself!

Man: As you wish! (throws Ezio a sword) Here! Use this!

Vieri de Pazzi: Kill them! Kill them all!

[The man and Ezio kill the Vieri crew.]

Ezio Auditore: You have my thanks.

Man: Keep the sword, Ezio.

Ezio Auditore: Do I know you from somewhere?

Man: Don’t you recognize me? It’s a-me, Mario!

Ezio Auditore: Uncle Mario?

Mario Auditore: (hugs Ezio) It’s been too long, nipote (nephew)! Far too long! I heard what happened in Firenze… Terrible. Come. Let’s get you all away from here.

[“Roadside Assistance” synchronized. Ezio and his family walk through the city to the palazzo.]

Casa Dolce Casa
Mario Auditore: So, tell me everything!

Ezio Auditore: They executed father for treason. Federico and Petruccio too. Then they came for me.

Mario Auditore: Do you know why?

Ezio Auditore: I have no answers, uncle… Only a list of names taken from a man who wished me dead. I still can’t believe they are gone…

Mario Auditore: Don’t worry. We will make sense of this.

Ezio Auditore: I wish I shared your optimism.

Mario Auditore: Come on, keep pace! We’re almost there. I think you will find much to like in Monteriggioni.

Ezio Auditore: I thought Monteriggioni was an enemy of Firenze…

Mario Auditore: For now. Next year it will be its friend. The year after its enemy again. And on and on, I cannot keep track. So I have stopped trying. These are honest, hardworking people. Our shops may only carry simple goods, but they’re well made and dependable. There’s a chapel here, too. The prete (priest) seems a nice enough, fellow but I’ve never been much of a believer. Did you know the Villa Auditore is almost 200 years old? It was built by my great-grandfather, a strange man, who carried all kinds of secrets. Keep your eyes open, and you might discover a few of them yourself… With all the fighting that’s been going on, this place has started to get a bit rough around the edges. I wish I could do something about it, but I just don’t have the time or money to fix things up. Guess that’s life, eh? Here we are. Casa dolce casa! (Home sweet home.) So? What do you think?

Ezio Auditore: It’s most impressive, uncle.

Mario Auditore: She’s seen better days, I suppose. Believe me, I’d have her shining again… if only I had the time. Now that you have had the tour, nipote (nephew), you should go and outfit yourself. My men in the market are expecting you. Return here when you’re finished and we’ll begin.

Ezio Auditore: Begin? Begin what?

Mario Auditore: I thought you’d come here to train?

Ezio Auditore: No, uncle. I came here to escape Firenze - and I intend to take my family further still.

Mario Auditore: But what about your father? He’d want you to finish his work.

Ezio Auditore: What work? My father was a banker.

Mario Auditore: Wait… He did not tell you?

Ezio Auditore: I have no idea what you’re talking about…

Mario Auditore: Ma che mi combini, Giovanni?! (What were you thinking, Giovanni?!) Where to even begin… Go and fetch the gear in the market. It will give me time to think.

Ezio Auditore: But—

Mario Auditore: But that’s that. We’ll talk more later. Some spending money, should you need it. And if you find yourself in need of rest, I’ve prepared a room for you on the top floor of the Villa.

[Ezio visits the blacksmith and the doctor. “Casa Dolce Casa” synchronized. Ezio returns to Villa Auditore.]

Ezio Auditore: (to Claudia) Don’t worry, we’re only staying here for a little while.

Claudia Auditore: I don’t like it here. I want to go home.

Ezio Auditore: I know.

[He finds Mario.]

Practice Makes Perfect
Ezio Auditore: Salute (Hello), uncle. I did as you asked.

Mario Auditore: And quickly too. Ben fatto! (Well done!) Now let’s teach you how to fight.

Ezio Auditore: No. As I said, we are leaving.

Mario Auditore: Ezio! You barely held your own against Vieri. You won’t survive a week on the road. If you want to leave - so be it. But at least do so armed with the skills and knowledge necessary to defend yourself. If not for me, for your mother and sister.

Ezio Auditore: Fine.

Mario Auditore: Ottimo! (Very good!) You can swing a sword, to be sure. But offense alone will not carry a battle. You must survive long enough to strike. I will teach you how to dodge.

Ezio Auditore: You said my father was more than just a banker?

Mario Auditore: No use dancing around it, I suppose. Your father was an Assassin, Ezio.

Ezio Auditore: I told you before: my father was a paper pusher.

Mario Auditore: No. He was born and bred to kill.

Mario Auditore: I find this difficult to believe.

Mario Auditore: What of the list you carry? Do you think it’s merely a catalog of debts? It holds the names of those responsible for your father’s murder.

[Ezio practices quickstep.]

Mario Auditore: Bene. (Good.) I’ve taught you how to avoid your enemy’s attacks. Now you’ll learn how to turn them to your advantage!

Ezio Auditore: All this talk of Assassins and Templars. It reeks of fantasy.

Mario Auditore: Like something from an old parchment covered in arcane writing, perhaps?

Ezio Auditore: How did you know…?

Mario Auditore: You have your father’s blade. I figured you’d have the Codex page he was holding as well.

Ezio Auditore: Codex?

Mario Auditore: Si. (Yes.) A guide to the inner workings of the order - its origin, purpose and techniques. Our creed, if you will. Your father believed the Codex contained a powerful secret. Something that would change the world. Perhaps it’s why they came for him…

Ezio Auditore: Assassins, Templars, Codex pages… This is a lot to take in.

Mario Auditore: You need to open your mind, Ezio. Always remember: Nothing is true, Everything is permitted.

[Ezio practices Counter Kill and Taunt.]

Mario Auditore: You’re making fine progress, Ezio! Today I’m going to teach you how to position yourself in battle. Where you stand and how you move can make all the difference. Don’t think I haven’t seen you picking apart my library. I trust you believe me now?

Ezio Auditore: Yes. My father was an Assassin. But why the need for such secrecy?

Mario Auditore: Are you familiar with the Templars? One of several knightly orders formed during the Crusades. History teaches they were disbanded nearly 200 years ago in France. Only they weren’t. Merely pushed underground where they continued their nefarious work.

[Ezio practices figthing on the swords.]

Mario Auditore: Well done, nipote (nephew)! You’ve really come into your own.

Ezio Auditore: Thank you, uncle, for all you have given me.

Mario Auditore: You’re family. Such is my duty and my desire!

Ezio Auditore: I’m glad you had me stay.

Mario Auditore: Good! You’ve reconsidered leaving!

Ezio Auditore: We sail for Spain in three days…

Mario Auditore: But nipote (nephew), I have given you these skills that you might be better prepared to strike against our enemies…

Ezio Auditore: And if they find me, I will.

Mario Auditore: You want to leave, Ezio? To throw away everything your father fought and died for? To deny your heritage? Fine! Come vuoi. Arrivederci e buona fortuna. (So be it. Goodbye and good luck.)

Ezio Auditore: Uncle, wait— Why is he so upset?

Sword Master: How can he not be? Vieri’s been harassing us ever since you first arrived. To be expected, I suppose. Given his heritage…

[Jump in time. Ezio runs after his uncle.]

Ezio Auditore: Uncle! Where is everyone?

Servant: They ride for San Gimignano to slay that snake, Vieri.

Ezio Auditore: I wish to join them.

Servant: You’ll find what you need at the stables.

[“Practice Makes Perfect” synchronized. Ezio enters his mother’s bedroom on the manor. Claudia walks in the room.]

Claudia Auditore: Ezio, look at her. I still can’t get her to talk! She spends all day and night in front of those feathers Petruccio used to collect. She can’t let him go. I don’t know what to do.

Ezio Auditore: Don’t worry. She’ll come back to us, I know it.

[He saddles a horse and rides in San Gimignano in Tuscany to find his uncle.]

What Goes Around
Mario Auditore: Ezio? What are you doing here?

Ezio Auditore: Taking responsibility. Vieri troubles you because of me.

Mario Auditore: (laughs) Vieri troubles us because he is a Templar and we are Assassins.

Ezio Auditore: Either way, I wish to help.

Mario Auditore: Va bene. (Alright.) Then listen close: First we must find a way inside the city. Though it seems Vieri expects us… He has sealed the gates and sent his men to guard them. Fortunately for us, the city is larger than his host. The southern gate suffers for it. So this is where we will strike. Pronti? (Ready?)

[By night they come to the Castle de Pazzi.]

Mario Auditore: Alright, Ezio. Here’s how it is going to work: My men and I will distract the guards. Once we’ve engaged them, get yourself over the wall and find a way to open the gate. Take these throwing knives. Use them to dispatch the archers.

Ezio Auditore: I’m ready when you are.

Mario Auditore: Then let us begin. (outloud) All’attacco! (Charge)

[Ezio climbs inside the castle, quietly kills the guards and lifts the gate.]

Mario Auditore: Well done, Ezio! We’re in! This way, men! (to Ezio) I want you to distract those guards, and keep them from raising the alarm. Hopefully it will buy me enough time to find and silence Vieri.

Ezio Auditore: Va bene. (Alright.)

Mario Auditore: Wait, nipote (nephew). Take a few of my men with you… Just to be safe. Come join me once they’re dealt with.

Mario’s Soldier 1: What’s Vieri up to now?

Mario’s Soldier 2: No one knows. But something has him on edge. How else to explain all the patrols?

Mario’s Soldier 1: We’re meant to be soldiers. Instead he’s turned us into nursemaids. And why?

Mario’s Soldier 2: Shooting his mouth off again, no doubt. Angering the wrong sorts of people… And so now we pay the price.

[Ezio deals with the guards and returns to his uncle, but finds only the wounded soldier.]

Mario’s Soldier 3: Ezio! Your uncle’s under attack and needs help! Go to him.

[On a wide square near the palace there is a real massacre. Ezio helps his uncle by killing the soldiers of Vieri.]

Mario Auditore: Ah, nipote (nephew)! There you are! It seems my plan has hit something of a snag… Vieri’s men ambushed us, and now we’ve got our hands full. My brothers and I will deal with these guards - want you to go on ahead and root out that snake! Find Vieri! See that justice is served!

[Ezio leaves the battlefield and climbs on roofs. From there he manages to overhear the conversation of the Templar conspirators.]

Man in Red Hood: It’s settled: Vieri, you will remain here to coordinate the mercenari (mercenaries). Francesco will organize our forces in the city and send word when it’s time to strike. Jacopo, your job is to calm the citizens once the deed is done.

Vieri de Pazzi: What of that ubriacone (drunkard) Mario? He continues to harass my forces and I fear he’ll discover what we intend.

Francesco de Pazzi: He’s always been trouble. Just like that bastardo (bastard) brother of his.

Vieri de Pazzi: Then let me reunite them, father!

Man in Red Hood: There will be plenty of time to clean up the rifiuti (trash) when we’re finished. Now, is there anything else? Muy bien. (Very good.) May the Father of Understanding guide you!

Vieri, Francesco & Jacopo: May the Father of Understanding guide you!

[A soldier rushes in.]

Soldier: Commandante! Commandante! (Commander! Commander!)

Vieri de Pazzi: What?!

Soldier: Mario Auditore has invaded the city! He comes for you!

Vieri de Pazzi: (laughs) Then let’s not keep him waiting.

[Ezio assassinates him.]

Ezio Auditore: What are you and your allies planning? Is this what my father discovered? Is this why he was killed?

Vieri de Pazzi: (on his deathbed) I’m sorry, were you hoping for a confession?

Ezio Auditore: (screams) Pezzo di merda! Vorrei solo che avessi sofferto di più! Hai avuto la fine che meritavi! Spero che bru— (Piece of shit! I only wish you’d suffered more! You met the fate you deserved! I hope yo—)

Mario Auditore: Enough, Ezio! Show some respect.

Ezio Auditore: Respect? After all that’s happened? Do you think he would have shown either of us such kindness?

Mario Auditore: You are not Vieri. Do not become him.

[He walks to Vieri’s body.]

Mario Auditore: Che la morte ti dia la pace che cercavi. (May death provide the peace you sought.) Requiescat in Pace. (Rest in peace.) (to Ezio) Take this. Read it when you have the time. Our work here is finished. Let us return to the villa…

[“What Goes Around” synchronized. Ezio returns to Palazzo de Auditore.]

A Change Of Plans
Mario Auditore: (to his men) And here he is! Our campione (champion), Ezio!

Soldiers: All hail Ezio!

Ezio Auditore: (smiles) I see you’ve wasted no time starting the celebration.

Mario Auditore: And why not?! You’ve done us a great service, nipote (nephew). With Vieri dead, la Toscana (Tuscany) will grow quiet once more. Do you know what that means?

Soldier 1: Basta lavorare! (No more work!)

Soldier 2: Si passa tutto il giorno a bere! (We can drink all day!)

Soldier 3: E a puttane! (And with whores!) What?! It’s true!

[Everyone laughs.]

Mario Auditore: Come, Ezio. Walk with me.

Ezio Auditore: Yes uncle? The Pazzi answer to another; a Spaniard.

Mario Auditore: He is Rodrigo Borgia, one of the most powerful men in all of Europe and leader of the Templar Order.

Ezio Auditore: Which makes him responsible for the murder of my father and brothers.

Mario Auditore: Yes. And he will kill you too, given the chance.

Ezio Auditore: Then I must stand against him if I wish to be free… …But not until every other Templar has fallen to my blade. Father’s list will guide me.

Mario Auditore: Where will you go next?

Ezio Auditore: Firenze. Francesco de’ Pazzi will share the fate of his son.

Mario Auditore: A sensible next step. No doubt he intends evil for the city. Alright. That’s enough grim talk for one night, I’ll be in my study if you need me.

[He leaves.]

Ezio Auditore: I should read the letter my uncle gave me…

[Ezio reads the latter titled “From:Uberto Alberti”.]

My love,
I put these thoughts to paper in the hope that I might one day have courage to share them with you. In time, you’ll no doubt learn that I betrayed Giovanni, labeled him a traitor and sentenced him to die.
History will likely judge this to have been a matter of politics and greed. Know that it was not hate that forced my hand, but fear. When the Medici robbed us of all we owned, I found myself afraid. For you. For our son. For the future. What hope in this world for a man without proper means?
They offered me money and land in exchange for my collaboration. And so this is how I came to betray my closest friend. However unspeakable the act, it seemed necessary at the time. And even now, looking back, I see no other way…

[After that he walks into his uncle’s room. He looks at several pieces of paper hanging from the wall.]

Mario Auditore: Look familiar?

Ezio Auditore: Other Codex Pages.

Mario Auditore: Yes. Your father managed to find and translate a few before he… Here. This is not your father’s work. Someone else has translated it.

Ezio Auditore: Leonardo da Vinci. A friend.

Mario Auditore: Do you see the way the words cross from one page to the next?

Ezio Auditore: There’s something underneath it all. Some kind of map. Where is it supposed to lead?

Mario Auditore: Your father and I managed to make out bits of a prophecy scrawled across these pages. It was written by an Assassin like us, who long ago held a "Piece of Eden." His name was Altaïr… He spoke of something powerful and ancient hidden beneath the land.

Ezio Auditore: What is it?

Mario Auditore: What indeed. Solving that little mystery is exactly why we collected these pages.

Ezio Auditore: Then let me help. It’s time I take on my father’s work. All of it. I’ll start with the page I took from Vieri. Leonardo will decode it for us.

Mario Auditore: Bene (Good). Return here when time permits and we’ll add it to the wall.

[Ezio hops around the city and collects 4 pieces of the Codex. “Change of Plans” synchronized. Memory Sequence 3 completed. Ezio rides to the Villa to check on Claudia.]

Memory Sequence 04: The Pazzi Conspiracy 
Ezio Auditore: Salute (Hi) Claudia--

Claudia Auditore: Our uncle is un mostro (a monster). This is outrageous!

Ezio Auditore: What’s happened?

Claudia Auditore: He’s making me work! If father was here, I’d never be stuck behind a desk like this.

Ezio Auditore: And what are the terms of this supposed enslavement?

Claudia Auditore: Since SOMEONE decided we’re going to stay here, Zio (Uncle) Mario’s suggested we try and find the money to repair the villa. Problem is, there isn’t any.

Ezio Auditore: I bet I can bring in some money.

Claudia Auditore: Oh great, more work for me. Well, benissimo (fine). If you start paying for improvements to the town, I’ll keep track of them in this book. And, since I have nothing better to do, I’ll also make note of any objects you bring in from the outside. If you actually get this place up and running, travelers might visit and spend money, although I doubt anyone will want to come this far out of the city. But if they do, I’ll keep the money we make in this chest. You’re going to have to show up to take it to the bank yourself, because when it gets full, I’m just going to take the extra cash for myself. Capito? (Understand?)

Ezio Auditore: Deal.

[Having put the money in the chest, Ezio approaches the man standing at the miniature of the villa.]

Ezio Auditore: Buon giorno (Good day). Is there something wrong?

Man: Ser Mario hired me to deal with this mess, but I’m an architetto (architect), not a miracle worker. Without money, I can’t fix any of these buildings.

Ezio Auditore: And if someone brought you money?

Man: Then we’d be in business! You must be Ser Ezio. Am I right?

Ezio Auditore: (loudly) Uncle! I like this architetto. (architect.)

Mario Auditore: He gets very observant when he can smell money!

Architect: If you want to fix up this town I’m going to need it. I have a price list here for new shops and renovations. Just bring me gold, make a choice and I’ll begin at once. If I build you a shop, you (as the landlord) can purchase goods there at lower rates. If you invest more money in the shop, you get an even greater discount. As for renovations, well… you’ll be bringing the town and villa back to life. As Ser Mario tells me, that was very important to your great-great grandfather. Plus, when you buy shops and renovations, you’ll be increasing the number of people who visit, causing your income to increase! So, let’s take a look, shall we?

[Ezio invests in the city.]

Architect: Buon viaggio! (Good travels!)

[Finally Ezio returns to his uncle.]

Mario Auditore: Ezio! My boy. I think it’s time I showed you something. (opens a secret hall behind a bookshelf) This is the Sanctuary. It was built by my great-grandfather to honor the memory of the Assassin order and protect its secrets. Look around! These are the assassins who guarded the freedom of humanity when it was most threatened.

[There are several statues of men and women in the hall. Behind the iron bars, closed with six locks, there is a statue of Altaïr. His armor lies at the foot of the statue.]

Mario Auditore: And this is the armor of Altaïr. Little is known about Altaïr’s life, but his armor is light and very strong. I’d give it to you, but I don’t know how to retrieve it. My great grandfather told me it would remain locked away until all its protectors were made whole. I heard rumors of crypts located throughout Italia, hidden tombs filled with treasure where these six were moved centuries ago. Maybe they have something to do with it. In my younger days, I sought the six myself… with no success. Perhaps you will have better luck.

Rebecca Crane: (in Ezio’s head) In order to achieve perfect synchronization with Ezio, you have to get that armor.

[Ezio gets on the horse and rides to his old friend.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Ezio…? You are still alive!

Ezio Auditore: Look at this place! The past two years have been kind to you.

Leonardo da Vinci: But you are not the same at all, are you…?

Ezio Auditore: I was hoping you might be able to help me with something,

Leonardo da Vinci: Anything for you, my friend!

[Ezio hands him another scroll.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Aha! You’ve found another one! How exciting! Hmmm. This one is tricky to break… Clever in its use of ancient languages. Maybe if I just… Oh… Oh! It seems to be a manual of sorts for different assassination techniques.

Ezio Auditore: May I see it?

Leonardo da Vinci: Wait! What’s that?! It’s not so much a design this time… Just a series of sketches. Hmmmm. What to make of all this… Hoho! Of course! And why not! What an inspired ideal

Ezio Auditore: Can you make it for me — while I try what’s in that manual fragment.

Leonardo da Vinci: Take it. I’ll have my assistant set up some dummies for you to practice with. -- Eh, Vincenzo!!

[Ezio goes out into the courtyard to try out new techniques of assassination. After that he returns to Leonardo’s house.]

Leonardo da Vinci: I’ve done it! Come quickly! Look! Take it. Try it.

Ezio Auditore: Thank you, Leonardo.

Leonardo da Vinci: Non c’è di che! (No problem!)

Ezio Auditore: There’s someone I need to "see" while I’m here. I cannot approach him publicly… Would you know a way-

Leonardo da Vinci: La Volpe.

Ezio Auditore: The Fox…?

Leonardo da Vinci: Shhhh!

Ezio Auditore: Capisco… (I understand) But do you know where a fox might roam…?

Leonardo da Vinci: Perhaps, near the Mercato, where the thieves dwell… Sta’ attento, amico! (Be safe, friend!)

[“Practice What You Preach” synchronized.]

Fox Hunt
[Now Ezio needs to find La Volpe somewhere near the Mercato Vecchio. It’s a pretty vast market full of people and guards. Suddenly some young man runs into Ezio.]

Ezio Auditore: What? My pouch! - My money!

Pickpocket: Oh… your money… I don’t have your money! (laughs)

[Ezio runs after the thief.]

Ezio Auditore: Get back here!

Pickpocket: Make me.

Ezio Auditore: You’re making a big mistake, my friend! Enough of this!

Pickpocket: Enough indeed! Why don’t you give up?

[Finally Ezio catches the thief.]

Ezio Auditore: I really have no interest in hurting you. So give me back my money and we’ll call it even.

Hooded Man: Not so fast.

Ezio Auditore: What do you want? Who are you!?

Hooded Man: They call me many things: Murderer. Tagliagole (Cutthroat). Thief. But you may call me La Volpe. At your service, Messer Ezio.

Ezio Auditore: ((laugs) How do you know my name?

La Volpe: It is my business to know everything in this city. Isn’t that why you’re here?

Ezio Auditore: Indeed. I need to find someone to know where he’ll be before even he does.

La Volpe: Who?

Ezio Auditore: Francesco de Pazzi.

La Volpe: There’s word on the street of a caravan just arrived from Roma. A secret meeting at sunset tonight. You can learn something of Francesco’s wherabouts there.

Ezio Auditore: Do you know where it is to be held?

La Volpe: Ma certo (Yes). Let me know when you’re ready and we’ll go. Oh, yes. Here’s your money.

[“Fox Hunt” mission synchronized.]

See You There
[Ezio finds La Volpe on the street.]

La Volpe: Follow me. But we must move fast! Think you can keep up?

Ezio Auditore: Nessun problema. (Not a problem.)

[La Volpe climbs a building nearby.]

La Volpe: (laughs) What are you doing back there? I said to keep up with me!

[Ezio needs to keep up with La Volpe who is really fast and agile! He’s panting hard at Santa Maria Novella where La Volpe leads him.]

La Volpe: Here we are! Francesco de Pazzi is meeting his people inside that church.

Ezio Auditore: How do I join them?

La Volpe: There are catacombs that run under the city. They’ll lead you to a place where you can eavesdrop on the meeting. Grip that stone handle, turn it, then slide it down.

Ezio Auditore: Thank you for all your help, Volpe.

La Volpe: (pats Ezio’s shoulder) Buona Fortuna. (Good luck.)

[“See You There” synchronized.]

Novella’s Secret
[Ezio finds a secret passage to the underground part of Santa Maria Novella. He pushes his fingers through the eye sockets of a skull in a half-cup-shaped recess in the wall of a house and a circular opening opens on the floor like a manhole. Ezio jumps down and finds himself in the dilapidated catacombs. There are bones everywhere and one would think it was a crypt of sorts. He needs to infiltrate the catacombs and find a way to the Templars meeting. After a series of acrobatic puzzles he funds two guards.]

Guard 1: How long do we have to stand here, Saverio? It’s so cold.

Guard 2: What do you want Ilario? Messer Pazzi is paying us good money to watch the entrance, and the dead won’t try to murder us. I can’t wait to go home to Elena and tell her how much gold we made tonight!

[They shut the door behind them. Ezio finds a way to open it.]

Saverio: Merda (Shit)! The door! Keep watch while I go look. (unsheaths his sword) This was supposed to be an easy job.

Ilario: I told you we shouldn’t have come here. If I hear anything. I’m running to the other guard post, so help me God.

[Ezio quietly assassinates Saverio and goes to the other guard.]

Ilario: (frightened) Saverio! I’ll be back with the other guards! (runs away)

[Ezio chases the fleeting Templar and finally kills him too. He find a secret door to the meeting. As Ezio walks through the secret corridor he hers voices coming from the room next to it. He sits down by the bars to overhear the Templars talking.]

Voice: (paraying) Et benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti descendat super vos et maneat semper.

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: Grazie, padre. (Thank you, father.) Bernardo?

Bernardo Baroncelli: It’s all here. Swords. Staves. Axes. Armor. Bows. Our men will want for nothing.

Stefano da Bagnone: I take this gift to mean the Pope consents?

Rodrigo Borgia: He gave his blessing to the operation… "as long as nobody is killed."

Francesco de’ Pazzi: We’re all set for the Duomo in the morning. Signore. The bait’s been laid, but it wasn’t easy. His fool brother keeps changing his plans…

Bernardo Baroncelli: Si! (Yes!) We’ll need to be on hand to make sure Giuliano even gets out of bed for church tomorrow!

[The Templars laugh.]

Rodrigo Borgia: What is it, Jacopo? Do you think they suspect something?

[Old Jacopo gest gets his mouth open when interrupts him.]

Francesco de’ Pazzi: Impossible! The Medici are too arrogant or too stupid to even notice. Likely a bit of both.

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: Do not underestimate our enemies, Francesco. Or have you already forgotten how your son was murdered?

Francesco de’ Pazzi: We’ll suffer no such surprises this time, Maestro. You have my word. (bows)

Rodrigo Borgia: Molto bene. (Very well. I should be off. I’ve some other business to attend to before I return to Rome. Gentlemen. Tomorrow, a new sun rises over Firenze. May the Father of Understanding guide us.

All Templars: May the Father of Understanding guide us.

[Ezio walks further down the corridor and finds a large, richly decorated sarcophagus with an assassin symbol on its side and a hooded man resembling Altaïr on the massive cover. He slides it open and hears voices of the Animus crew.]

Shaun Hastings: (in Ezio’s head) Look at that statue. It’s identical to one in the Villa Auditore! I think you’ve stumbled onto one of the Assassins’ tombs Ezio’s uncle mentioned.

Rebecca Crane: (in Ezio’s head) Now that we know the way in, I’ll tag the landmarks containing tombs in the database.

[Inside the sarcophagus Ezio finds a Seal of Darius. He leaves the Catacombs. “Novella’s Secret” syncronized. Ezio climbs out of the hatch and walks to La Volpe.]

Ezio Auditore: I know where Francesco will be and when. But…

La Volpe: What is it?

Ezio Auditore: I overheard something… They have weapons, enough for a battalion. Even the Pope has given support!

La Volpe: Typical of Sixtus, but… (sighs) What the hell are they planning?

Ezio Auditore: I couldn’t understand the specifics. But it involves the Medici. And it begins tomorrow morning, at the Duomo.

La Volpe: The Medici will all be there for Sunday service… Along with the rest of Firenze. They’re going to do it right in the middle of High Mass…

Ezio Auditore: But it’s also a chance for me to blend with the crowd, get close, and stop this madness.

La Volpe: If they succeed… If we lose Lorenzo, and Firenze falls to the Pazzi…

Ezio Auditore: It will not come to that. I promise.

La Volpe: I hope you’re right…

Wolves In Sheep’s Clothing
[Ezio runs to Doumno and gets to it by morning. The plaza ]

Ezio Auditore: There’s Lorenzo, and his wife. There’s Giuliano, Lorenzo’s brother. But where is Francesco…?

[Meanwhile in the crowd…]

Francesco de’ Pazzi: (to Bernardo) There he is. Time to strike.

[Fat Bernardo Baroncelli attacks Giuliano de’ Medici with a thin dagger.]

Bernardo Baroncelli: Crepa traditore! (Here, traitor!)

[He manages to inflict several cuts on Giuliano, but none of them are fatal. Francesco runs to the aid of the lumpy idiot.]

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Giuliano! No—!

[Taking advantage of Lorenzo’s confusion, Father Stefano da Bagnone stabs him in the back with a dagger. Lorenzo collapses on the cobblestone street, bleeding to death. Meanwhile, Francesco and Bernardo overpower Giuliano and Bernardo stabs him again with a dagger. Giuliano falls to the ground.]

Giuliano de’ Medici: No! In nome di Dio, vi scongiuro! Pietá! (No! In the name of God. I beg you, mercy!)

Francesco de’ Pazzi: Nessuna pietá, cane maledetto! Muori! Muori! Muoriii! (No mercy for you, dog! Die! DIE!)

[He stabs Giuliano multiple times in rage. Antonio Maffei and Stefano da Bagnone try to stop the madman but he pushes them away. Frightened by Francesco’s blood rage they run away. Noticing that Lorenzo is still alive and even fights, Fracesco unshelths his sword and run to him.]

Francesco de’ Pazzi: Your day is done, Lorenzo! Your entire family dies by my sword!

[It’s time for Ezio to intervene. He fights through the soldiers of the conspirators.]

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Wait… Please. I need help.

[Ezio kills the soldiers but Francesco escapes during the fight.]

Lorenzo de’ Medici: You… saved my life.

Ezio Auditore: It’s nothing. But the man who did this to you has to pay!

[Lorenzo falls to his knees. He’s badly wounded. Exio helps him to stand up.]

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Not now… I need help first… To my home… People I can trust there… Can you…?

[Ezio escorts Lorenzo to his home.]

Lorenzo de’ Medici: I’m losing a lot of blood…

Ezio Auditore: Hang on, Signore! I’m moving as fast as I can.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Francesco de Pazzi! I’ll kill him! I’ll wipe his entire family from the city! They’ll be ERASED!

Ezio Auditore: Quietatevi. Signore. (Be still, sir) Conserve your energy, or I’ll be delivering a corpse. We’re almost there now…

[Ezio fights through groups and groups of conspirator’s soldiers. FInally he gets Lorenzo home and bangs on the door.]

Ezio Auditore: Lorenzo’s been wounded! Aprite la porta! (Open the door!)

Guard: What’s the password?

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Poliziano! Open the maledetta porta!! (fucking door!!)

[Frightened Poliziano quickly opens the door.]

Poliziano: By the Thrice Greatest! Come in. Quickly! The city is at war! Hurry!

[Ezio walks away…]

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Wait… I am in your debt. Tell me. Why did you help me?

Ezio Auditore: You are not the only one who lost a brother to the Pazzi. My name is Ezio Auditore.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: You’re Giovanni’s son… Your father was a good man. He understood honor, loyalty.

Guard: The Pazzi thugs are storming the Palazzo della Signoria! We can’t hold them off much longer--

Poliziano: No! If they get inside, they’ll murder all our supporters and put their own devils in power!

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Then my survival would mean nothing. I have to… (he tries to stand up but wrinkles in pain) Francesco de Pazzi…. Help save our city, Auditore… Kill him.

[Ezio walks out of Lorenzo’s house and sees Poliziano.]

Guard: Signore. I saw Francesco lead a battalion around the back of the Palazzo della Signoria. I fear he may be seeking another way in.

Poliziano: Go! Before it’s too late. Do what you can.

[“Wolves In Sheep’s Clothing” mission syncronized.]

Farewell Francesco
[It’s time to finish the job. He walks quietly like a shadow through the streets in the night, though the fighting men care nothing for the guy in the strange clothes. Soon Ezio reaches Palazzo della Signoria and sees Francesco on top of it.]

Francesco de’ Pazzi: You, again!? Why aren’t you dead? - Men! Slaughter him!

[Ezio climbs on the building killing Francesco’s soldiers on the way.]

Francesco de’ Pazzi: Oh! The boy thinks himself a master swordsman. So you’ve drawn some blood! My men will make short work of you!

[Ezio reaches the top of Palazzo della Signoria.]

Francesco de’ Pazzi: Guards--! GUARDS!!

Ezio Auditore: No one’s coming… It’s just us now.

Francesco de’ Pazzi: Maledetto! Che il diavolo ti porti! Stammi lontano! (Damn it! Damn you to hell! Get the hell away from me!)

[Francesco tries to escape, but Ezio catches up with him and kills him with his concealed blade.]

Ezio Auditore: Now Firenze will judge you for what you’ve done.

Francesco de’ Pazzi: It’s over… It’s all over…

Ezio Auditore: Meglio essere felici in questa vita che aspirare a esserlo nella prossima. (Better to be content in this life, than aspire to it in the next). Requiescat in Pace. (Rest in peace).

[Meanwhile Jacopo de’ Pazzi on his horse agitates the people to fight.]

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: Libertà! Libertà! Libertà! Popolo e libertà! (Liberty! Liberty! Liberty! People and liberty!)

People: Libertà!

[Suddenly the naked corpse of Francesco de’ Pazzi descends from the roof on a rope. He is tied by the neck as if he had been hanged.]

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: Francesco…?

Memory Sequence 05: Loose Ends
Four To The Floor
REPUBBLICA FIORENTINA
1478

[Ezio finds Lorenzo de’ Medici on the street looking on the water. He seems fully healed.]

Lorenzo de’ Medici: When I was six years old I fell into the Arno. I soon found myself drifting down and into darkness, certain my life was at an end. Instead, I woke to the sound of my mother weeping. At her side
stood a stranger, soaking and smiling at me. She explained that he had saved me. And so began a long and prosperous relationship between two families: yours and mine. I am sorry I could not save your father and brothers.

Ezio Auditore: You have nothing to apologize for. I believe Jacopo de’ Pazzi played a part in their deaths. The attack on you as well. I need to find him.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: That coward fled before we could arrest him!

Ezio Auditore: Have you any leads?

Lorenzo de’ Medici: No. They’ve hidden themselves well.

Ezio Auditore: They?

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Jacopo was not the only conspirator to escape.

Ezio Auditore: If they work with Jacopo they were surely involved in the plot against my family as well. Give me their names.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Antonio Maffei, Archbishop Francesco Salviati, Stefano da Bagnone and Bernardo Baroncelli.

Ezio Auditore: Bene. (Good) I will go and see my uncle. He has men stationed in the countryside.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Wait… Before you go

[He pulls out a piece of paper.]

Ezio Auditore: A Codex page!

Lorenzo de’ Medici: I took it from the files of Francesco de Pazzi, seeing as he clearly no longer needs it. I’ve always had an interest in things of antiquity. As did your father.

Ezio Auditore: It is meaningful to me as well.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Then consider it a gift! Che il Signore ci protegga. (God save us all.)

[They put their hands on each other’s shoulders. “Four To The Floor” synchronized.]

Il Duomo’s Secret
[Ezio sneaks into Il Duomo to find another seal.]

Monk: Di grazia (Please), stay away from the artwork on the walls! And when your men paint the dome, take care not to disturb any of the sacred relics in the lanterna on top. They are the most important artifacts in our church.

Worker: Yes, yes Padre (Father). Just make sure to pay us the full sum for our work.

[Ezio begins to climb the supports until he finds a ladder to get down.]

Ezio Auditore: Bene (good). Now I have a way back up in case I fall.

[After the next series of elaborate acrobatic tricks, Ezio finds a secret room with an assassin’s sarcophagus and retrieves the Seal of Iltani. “Il Duomo’s Secret” synchronized. Ezio jumps out the window and climbs to the very top of the building - the fiery cross - and jumps off in a leap of faith into the haystack. Afterwards, he returns to Leonardo.]

A Blade With Bite
Leonardo da Vinci: Ezio! Thank God you’re all right! This madness with the Medici and the Pazzi… Is this why you pursued Francesco?

Ezio Auditore: Not exactly…

Leonardo da Vinci: Well, whatever your reasons, the city’s safe again - thanks to you! Now tell me: how may be of service. Ah! Another page!

[He takes in Ezio’s discovery with interest.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Aha! It’s a similar cipher to the last one. This won’t take long… Interesting… Oh… Indeed… I see… It’s another blade design -- for delivering poison!

Ezio Auditore: Can you build it?

Leonardo da Vinci: Si! (Yes!) It won’t take very long. I just need to find a way to hollow out the blade without sacrificing the—

[Ezio already removes his hidden blade.]

Ezio Auditore: It’s alright, Leonardo. Just do what you need to do.

[A bit of time passes.]

Leonardo da Vinci: All done! I’ve filled your blade with a bit of poison to start with. Should you run out, just visit a doctor.

Ezio Auditore: Poison? From a doctor?

Leonardo da Vinci: In high enough doses, that which cures, can kill.

Ezio Auditore: I am in your debt once more, my friend.

Leonardo da Vinci: Anytime, Ezio! Anytime!

[“A Blade With Bite” synchronized. Ezio saddles his horse and goes to his villa. He goes to Uncle Mario.]

Evasive Maneuvers
Mario Auditore: Ezio! Haha, Come in, come in! To what do we owe the honor?

Ezio Auditore: I’ve been sent from Firenze by Il Magnifico to attend to some unfinished business. I’m looking for Jacopo de Pazzi.

Mario Auditore: Ha… Who isn’t? We’ve been at it for days.

Ezio Auditore: Then perhaps what I carry will help us both: a list of his conspirators. One of them WILL talk before he dies.

Mario Auditore: Excellent! These men are sure to lack Jacopo’s resources, which means they will be easier to find. I will put my scouts to it at once.

Ezio Auditore: I appreciate the help, uncle. I’ve got something else for you as well: more Codex pages.

[He hands his uncle the page he found.]

Mario Auditore: Ah! Let’s see what we can learn. What is this…? What Prophet…?

Ezio Auditore: What did you find, uncle?

Mario Auditore: Just another damn mystery! The text here roughly translates to: "Only the prophet may open it…" There’s reference to two "Pieces of Eden." But these pages offer no answers, nipote (nephew). At least not on their own. You must find more.

Ezio Auditore: We’ll have to save it for another day, uncle. I have a mission to attend to.

Mario Auditore: As you wish. Now, if you hope to defeat these bastardi (bastards), I will need to teach you a few things. Meet me on the practice field.

[They go to the encircled practice area.]

Mario Auditore: Alright, Ezio. You’re familiar with counter-attacking - but what happens when your enemy is as well?

Ezio Auditore: I don’t usually give them the opportunity.

Mario Auditore: Tough talk offers little protection against Templar steel.

Ezio Auditore: Then by all means, maestro - teach me what to do!

Mario Auditore: Now dodge!

[Ezio dodges a few strakes then disarms Mario.]

Mario Auditore: Magnifico! Once again you exceed my expectations!

Mercenary: Signore! (Sir!) We’ve found Jacopo’s men, and await your word to strike!

Mario Auditore: Relay the following: no man moves until they have spoken with Ezio. Intesi? (Understand?)

Mercenary: It will be done!

Mario Auditore: Go, Ezio! Visit with my mercenaries in the countryside. See if Jacopo’s lackeys won’t lead you to him. But be careful. They will be expecting you!

[“Evasive Maneuvers” synchronized. Ezio rides to San Gimignano.]

The Cowl Does Not Make The Monk
Mario’s Mercenary: Ah! There you are! Listen, we’ve found Stefano da Bagnone. Just follow this road and it’ll bring you to the abbey where he’s taken refuge. Wait. Before you go… Take these. You can use them to create a distraction.

Ezio Auditore: My thanks, friend.

[He gets a few Smoke Bombs. Ezio infiltrates the abbey and finds Stefano da Bagnone.]

Monk: (to Stefano) Let us pray, brother.

Stefano da Bagnone: Pray? Pray for what?

Monk: The Lord’s protection!

Stefano da Bagnone: If you think the LORD has any interest in our affairs, you’ve another thing coming. But please, by all means, continue to delude yourself if it helps to pass the time.

[As he comes close to Stefano, Ezio kills him with a sharp thrust of his sword.]

Stefano da Bagnone: Now I will see who was right…

Ezio Auditore: Where is Jacopo?

Stefano da Bagnone: Nothing to fear I suppose… They meet in the shadow of the Roman Gods…

Ezio Auditore: Ora sei libero dalla paura (Be free of your fear now.) Requiescat in Pace. (Rest in peace.)

[Now Ezio has to deal with a mob of armed monks. Deciding not to try his luck, he throws a smoke bomb and escapes from the abbey. “The Cowl Does Not Make The Monk” synchronized. He rides to another of Mario’s mercenary.]

Behind Closed Doors
Mario’s Mercenary: Over here Ezio. We’ve found Archbishop Salviati! He’s barricaded himself inside that villa… Take some of my men. Use them to clear the fields. Then find a way over the walls so you can open the gates.

Ezio Auditore: Hmmm… Command over my own army? A nice change of pace from the usual sneaking and stabbing. I like it.

[Now that Ezio has some fighters at his disposal, he decides to strike openly and attack the guards.]

Guard: I see you there, Assassin!

Francesco Salviati: (form a wall) These walls have stood for a hundred years and will stand for a hundred more! Stop wasting the lives of your men! Vattene! Vattene via! (Go away!) All that awaits you here is death! Turn back!

[But Ezio continues.]

Francesco Salviati: I warned you to stay away, Assassin! You should have listened!! Men prepare yourselves, the Assassin has arrived!

Ezio Auditore: I need to find a way to open the gates…

Francesco Salviati: You’re finished, Assassin! Do you hear me?! Finished!

[Thanks to his rants, Ezio easily figures out where Francesco is and, sneaking up on him, kills him with his concealed blade.]

Ezio Auditore: Where is Jacopo?

Francesco Salviati: He knows you come for him… emerging only in darkness to meet with the others…

Ezio Auditore: That answers when… Now tell me where? La fede dovrebbe dare conforto, non pena. (Faith should bring comfort, not pain.) Requiescat in Pace. (Rest in peace.)

[Dealing with some guards as he escapes, Ezio leaves the villa. “Behind Closed Doors” synchronized. Ezio rides to San Gimignano and finds Mario’s Mercenary.]

Town Crier
Mario’s Mercenary: Salute Ezio! (Hail!) Antonio Maffei has sought refuge atop the city’s tallest structure - spouting scripture and arrows in equal measure. The man has clearly lost his mind. Making matters worse, he’s posted archers all around him. You’d do well to clear them out before approaching.

Ezio Auditore: Grazie for the information.

[As Ezio makes his way to his target, Antonio Maffei is furiously agitating his flock.]

Antonio Maffei: Citizens of San Gimignano, heed well my words! You must repent! REPENT and seek FORGIVENESS! For your wicked ways have incurred the wrath of a DEMON! Summoned by your sins, he now walks our world, cloaked in shadow and darkness! And everywhere he treads, DEATH FOLLOWS! Why you ask? Because you have STRAYED and sacrificed your liberty I to that wretch LORENZO DE MEDICI. You are puppets, enslaved by PURSE STRINGS! Won over by POISONOUS WORDS! You have lost your virtue. You have lost your dignity. You have lost your FAITH! And this DRAWS the demons in to feed. And feed they will! All whilst you wander LOST in ignorance. KNOW that GOOD MEN have died protecting you from his evils. Men who sought to SAVE these lands, to PURIFY them! Join me in prayer, my children so that TOGETHER we might stand against this DARKNESS! Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; And hear, earth, the words of my mouth. Let my teaching drop as the rain, My speech distill as the dew. As raindrops on the tender herb. And as showers on the grass. For proclaim the name of the LORD: Ascribe greatness to our God. He is the Rock, His work is perfect: For all His ways are justice, A God, of truth and without injustice; Righteous and upright is He. "They have corrupted themselves, They are not His children, Because of their blemish: A perverse and crooked generation. Do you thus deal with the LORD. O foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who bought you? Has He not made you and established you? By the light of the LORD, be cleansed! No grazie! (No thanks!) I will put you on your knees, sinner! You would enjoy that wouldn’t you? Beg forgiveness! He is the Rock. His work is perfect: For all His ways are justice. A God of truth and without injustice—

[Climbing the tower from which Antonio’s voice comes, he sneaks up on him and kills him with his blade.]

Antonio Maffei: Away with you, demon!

Ezio Auditore: Have some respect for death, my friend.

Antonio Maffei: I’ll show you respect! -

Ezio Auditore: No, I will. Che tu possa alfine trovare riposo nel corpo e nella mente. (May your body and mind at last be still.) Requiescat in Pace. (Rest in peace.)

[“Town Crier” synchronized. Ezio visits another of Mario’s Mercenaries.]

Come Out And Play
Mario’s Mercenary: Ezio! About time you got here. We’ve found Bernardo Baroncelli.

Ezio Auditore: Ottima notizia! (This is good news!) Tell me where he is and I’ll see that he’s dealt with.

Mario’s Mercenary: That’s the trouble. Lorenzo actually had him arrested days ago, after being returned to us from Constantinople. But he escaped! We believe him to be somewhere inside San Gimignano.

Ezio Auditore: Va bene. (Okay.) I’ll see if I can’t pin him down.

Mario’s Mercenary: How do you expect to succeed where the rest of us have failed?

Ezio Auditore: I have my ways…

Bernardo Baroncelli: …I just need to take things one day at a time… He’ll get bored… Lost… Confused… Distracted… Killed… It’ll be okay… And if he does come… If it happens… I keep moving… Never in one place for long… Only…

[Ezio jumps off the building and kills Bernardo along with his guard.]

Bernardo Baroncelli: I knew you would come…

Ezio Auditore: Where is Jacopo?

Bernardo Baroncelli: So you can do to him what you’ve done to me?

Ezio Auditore: There’s still time for you to clear your conscience.

Bernardo Baroncelli: We gather at the church when a meeting is called…

Ezio Auditore: Mi duole dover giungere a tanto. (I am sorry that it came to this.) Requiescat in Pace. (Rest in peace.)

[He escapes the guards and starts looking for Jacopo.]

With Friends Like These
Ezio Auditore: If I can stay my blade long enough to follow him, he’ll lead me to his Templar brothers. I’ll have more names for my list…

[He tails Jacopo blending with the environment.]

Ezio Auditore: What’s going on here? Are they late? They haven’t seen me, this much I know… What are you and the others planning, Jacopo… Your letter mentioned Venezia… Are there Templars there as well? How many men are responsible for my father’s death…?

[Ezio finds the location of the secret meeting. It turns out to be outside the city in an ancient Roman open-air temple. Ezio hides. Jacopo tries to cajole Rodrigo.]

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: I am sorry, Maestro! I did all I could, but the Assassin proved too strong.

Rodrigo Borgia: Clearly. Else the others would be here with you… To say nothing of the fact that Firenze remains in Medici hands.

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: It’s Francesco’s fault! His impatience made him reckless. I tried to be the voice of reason.

Emilio Barbarigo: More like the voice of cowardice.

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: You’re one to talk, Signor Barbarigo. Had you sent us quality weapons, instead of this garbage you Venetians callar

Rodrigo Borgia: (menacingly) Enough! We put our faith in your family and you repay us with inaction and incompetence. Then, when asked to account for your failures, you make excuses and insult us? How do you expect me to respond?

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: I don’t know…

Rodrigo Borgia: (puts his hand on Jacopo’s shoulder) It’s alright. I do.

[He stabs him in the chest with a dagger.]

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: No… please… don’t…

Emilio Barbarigo: (smirks) Please don’t what?

[He pushes Jacopo to the ground and apparently pokes him with a knife, too.]

Jacopo de’ Pazzi: (dying) I can fix this… Only, spare me…

Rodrigo Borgia: No.

[He draws his sword and pierces Jacopo’s throat.]

Rodrigo Borgia: What a mess… (outloud) So sorry to have claimed your prize, Assassin!

[Two soldiers grab Ezio.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Did you honestly think I wouldn’t expect you to follow? That I didn’t PLAN for it? We’ve been at this a lot longer than you! Kill him.

Ezio Auditore: (to the guards) I know you’re only doing as you’re told. So if you release me, I will spare your lives.

Guard: Hah! Listen to this one he—

[Ezio quickly deals with the guards. Rodrigo Borgia and Emilio Barbarigo meanwhile escape. Ezio approaches dying Jacopo.]

Ezio Auditore: Vai, amico, libero da fardelli e paure. (Go forward friend, unburdened and unafraid.) Requiescat in Pace. (Rest in peace.)

REPUBBLICA FIORENTINA
1480

Road Trip
[Ezio walks into Palazzo Medici and approaches Lorenzo.]

Ezio Auditore: The Pazzi are dead. Every one of them.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: I must admit, I’ve never before believed I could desire the death of others so badly.

Ezio Auditore: Nor I…

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Ezio. Thank you for the role you’ve played in keeping this dream of mine alive a little longer.

Ezio Auditore: (bows) L’onore è mio, Signore. (It is my honor, Signore.)

Lorenzo de’ Medici: What will you do now, figliolo (my boy)?

Ezio Auditore: There are still others I must hunt, Signore. They’re already digging their claws into the heart of Venezia.

Lorenzo de’ Medici: No! La bella Venezia… (Beautiful Venice…) Then that is where your journey must take you, Ezio… Before you leave us… I have something for you. A gift. This cape identifies you as a friend of the Medici. As long as you wear it, the city guards will be more tolerate of your actions. But be warned, it will not grant you immunity from the law.

[Ezio accepts the gift.]

Lorenzo de’ Medici: Che la fortuna favorisca la tua lama! (Fortune favor your blade!)

[Ezio bows and leaves the Palazzo. He goes to Leonardo’s house.]

Ezio Auditore: Leonardo!? Leonardo!

[But no one opens the door.]

Bypasser: Mi dispiace (I’m sorry), Messer, but he is gone. Maestro Leonardo was commissioned by a Venetian noble to paint some portraits. He paid for the Maestro to move his entire workshop to Venezia. It’s quite an opportunity!

Ezio Auditore: Grazie mille (Thanks a lot), friend.

[“Road Trip” synchronized. Ezio saddles his horse and rides towards docks then suddenly sees Leonardo on the road.]

Romagna Holiday
Ezio Auditore: Leonardo!

Leonardo da Vinci: Ezio…?! What luck! I… uh… I’ve run into a bit of trouble.

Ezio Auditore: Let me see if I can help.

Leonardo da Vinci: I know how to fix it - but lack the means to do so. If you could just lift, the wagon?

Ezio Auditore: What is this thing?

Leonardo da Vinci: Eh?

Ezio Auditore: It looks like a giant bat.

Leonardo da Vinci: Oh, nothing. Just an idea I’ve been working on… I could not leave it behind.

Ezio Auditore: What is it for?

Leonardo da Vinci: Well… I shouldn’t really talk about it. Beh, al diavolo! (what the hell!) I can’t hold it in anymore. Ezio! I think I’ve figured out how to make a man fly.

Ezio Auditore: (laughs) Come on. I’ll drive!

Leonardo da Vinci: But I haven’t even told you where I’m going…

[They ride in a cart for a while.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Venezia! Such a beautiful city! So many sources of inspiration! Ponte di Rialto, Piazza San Marco, L’Arsenale…

Ezio Auditore: Shhh.

Leonardo da Vinci: What’s wrong?

Ezio Auditore: We’re not alone.

[Two riders follow the cart. Ezio beats the horses with the reins and goes faster.]

Leonardo da Vinci: What’s happening!? Who are they?

Ezio Auditore: Rodrigo Borgia’s men…

Leonardo da Vinci: Why? What do they want with us?

Ezio Auditore: I think they want us dead. Leonardo! Hide!

[Leonardo hides inside the cart.]

Leonardo da Vinci: They’re trying to climb onboard! Knock them off! Ezio, someone’s on top! Do sharp turns to make the carriage roll. Watch out, don’t let the carriage roll over.

Ezio Auditore: Hold on tight, this is going to be a little rough!

[Borgia’s man using some kind of bombs to stop the cart but Ezio manages to avoid them.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Ezio! Watch out behind you! Do something! Hold on Ezio, were almost there!

[Near Romagna Leonardo gets out of his hiding.]

Ezio Auditore: Go, Leonardo!! They’re here for me, not you! I’ll catch up with you later!

[Leonardo jumps off the cart and Ezio deals with Borgia’s man using cold steel. “Romagna Holiday” synchronized. He meets with Leonardo in the docks.]

Tutti A Bordo (All Aboard)
Leonardo da Vinci: Ezio! Here! Over here! Thank you Ezio! You saved my life.

Ezio Auditore: I did what had to be done. You would have done the same.

Leonardo da Vinci: I doubt it. Bravery’s not my strong suit. I owe you a debt brother.

Ezio Auditore: Di niente. (It’s nothing.)

Sailor: Tutti a bordo! Fra poco si salpa! (All aboard! We’re leaving soon!)

Leonardo da Vinci: That’s our traghetto (ferry). Venezia awaits! Where’s your pass?

Ezio Auditore: What pass?

Leonardo da Vinci: You don’t have a pass?

Sailor: You cannot enter Venezia without a pass. Who invited you?

Ezio Auditore: Um… Nobody.

Sailor: Basta! (Stop!) No pass, no entrance.

Ezio Auditore: Don’t worry, Leonardo. I’ll come up with something.

Woman: Don’t just stand there! I need help!

[Ezio finds a boat and swims save to the screaming woman.]

Woman: Aiuto! Qualcuno mi faccia scendere da quest’affare! Aiutatemi! (Help! Someone get me off this thing! Help me!)

Ezio Auditore: Madonna.

Woman: Oh, you’re good. The ladies must like you.

Ezio Auditore: I wasn’t looking to impress. Only to help someone in distress.

Woman: Which is exactly WHY you impress. And you are Messer…?

Ezio Auditore: Auditore. - But, please, call me Ezio.

Woman: I’m Caterina. Now, Ezio, we must find you suitable reward… Do you have any suggestions?

Ezio Auditore: There is perhaps - something you could help me with…

Caterina: I’m all ears…

[A moment later at the ship…]

Sailor: Yes. Signora… Whatever you say Signora…

[Caterina walks to Ezio.]

Caterina: He won’t trouble you any more. I… took care of it.

Ezio Auditore: (bows) Thank you, Caterina.

Caterina: Perhaps we’ll see each other again… Should you ever find yourself in the city of Forli, it would be my pleasure to welcome you…

Ezio Auditore: I look forward to enjoying your hospitality.

Sailor: (to Ezio) Please accept my most humble apologies, Messere. (Sir.) Had I known…

Ezio Auditore: It’s quite alright my friend.

[“Tutti A Bordo” synchronized.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Be careful, Ezio. Do you know who that was?

Ezio Auditore: My next conquest?

Leonardo da Vinci: I don’t think so, Ezio! That’s Caterina Sforza, daughter of the Duca di Milano. Her husband—

Ezio Auditore: Husband?

Leonardo da Vinci: Si. (Yes.) Her husband is the Lord of Forli. That woman is as powerful and dangerous as she is young and beautiful.

Ezio Auditore: Sembra come una donna per me. (Sounds like my kind of lady.)

[As Ezio sails to Venice, Desmond has a chance to relax and leave Animus.]

Desmond Miles: Everything alright?

Lucy Stillman: Better than alright. You’re making amazing progress.

Shaun Hastings: "Amazing"’s quite a strong word…

Desmond Miles: Then why are we stopping?

Rebecca Crane: Prolonged exposure to the Animus can have… side effects.

Desmond Miles: Ha, awesome.

Lucy Stillman: It’s nothing to worry about. You haven’t shown any of the symptoms.

Desmond Miles: Symptoms? What symptoms?…

Rebecca Crane: Degradation of cognition, temporal hallucinations, multiple-awareness issues, overlapping realities… you know.

Desmond Miles: So what you’re saying is…

Shaun Hastings: What we’re saying, Desmond, is if you’re not careful, you may not need the Animus to visit with your ancestors. Which wouldn’t be a bad thing, assuming you could control it. Up until now, though… no one has.

Desmond Miles: Subject sixteen…

Lucy Stillman: We have safeguards, Desmond. And they kept him in the Animus for way too long - sometimes days at a time. We’re being careful with you.

Desmond Miles: I hope so.

Lucy Stillman: Anyway, I was hoping we could test out your skill retention - see if you’ve picked up some of Ezio’s abilities.

Desmond Miles: I’m game.

Lucy Stillman: Great, meet me downstairs when you’re ready.

[Desmond follows Lucy.]

Desmond Miles: So what’s the plan?

Lucy Stillman: We’re gonna see what you’ve managed to retain. Come on.

[They enter a vast storage room filled with boxes.]

Lucy Stillman: Abstergo’s out there, looking for us. They’re better funded and better equipped - so it’s only a matter of time before they find this place. We need to be ready for them when they do. I want you to activate the warehouse’s defense system. I’ll let you figure out how to reach the sensors.

Desmond Miles: Oh come on, not even a hint?

Lucy Stillman: Open your eyes, Desmond…

[Desmond starts hallucinating and sees some sketchy fight from Ezio’s life.]

Desmond Miles: Uh, Lucy… I’m seeing things…

Lucy Stillman: Do the hallucinations last longer than 30 seconds?

Desmond Miles: No…

Lucy Stillman: Then it’s nothing to be worried about. It’ll pass.

[Desmond switches the first sensor.]

Desmond Miles: So? How am I doing?

Lucy Stillman: You’ve picked up every single one of Ezio’s skills. The adoption rate is fantastic… Another day or two and we’ll be done.

[Desmond switches the second sensor.]

Desmond Miles: Alright, you go tell me: Why Ezio? Why Italy? I mean - We could have just gone back to Altaïr anin. Followed him during his early years.

Lucy Stillman: It started with sixteen…

Desmond Miles: Ah. Good old subject sixteen. He repainted my room, you know… WITH HIS BLOOD.

Lucy Stillman: I’d been going through his files. Vidic flagged a couple of his Animus sessions. A bunch of different ancestors - different dates and locations, Ancient Africa - the Middle East - but towards the end, he became obsessed with Italy. I think he knew about the Vault… A few of the records of his later Animus sessions are missing. And the sessions that are there… After everything the Templars put him through. After everything I put him through… It’s all scrambled… If we hadn’t pushed sixteen so hard - we’d have the answers already. And maybe he’d still be alive…

Desmond Miles: So you’re after the Codex and the Vault?

Lucy Stillman: I knew you had an ancestor in Italy who was at the center of all of this. Desmond! Over here!

[Desmond returns to Lucy.]

Lucy Stillman: Alright, I think we’re done for the day. You should get some rest.

Desmond Miles: Lucy, what happened to sixteen wasn’t your fault. You were just as much a prisoner as I was.

Lucy Stillman: Thanks. Goodnight, Desmond. (smiles) I’m glad you’re here.

[Desmond decides to practice some more and walks through the opened door. In the long corridor he hallucinates again, this time more vividly. Many people from the 15th century walk around him. Desmond grabs his head. He sees a woman running away and… he finds himself in Altaïr’s body… without the Animus.]

Desmond Miles: (like in a dream) What the hell… What is this…? Where am I…? It’s Acre. And… Altaïr? How the hell… I’m not even in the Animus. I must’ve passed out. Just having some kind of weird dream… Going without sleep for who knows how long… Guess I shouldn’t be surprised… Hmmm. That must be his target…

[Altaïr chases the woman and catches her at the top of the tower. The woman removes her hood.]

Desmond Miles: (like in a dream) Hey, it’s the woman from Acre. What was her name? Maria. Yeah. Wonder what he wants with her…

[Altaïr kisses Maria.]

Desmond Miles: Whoa… Alright, wasn’t expecting that…

[Altaïr and Maria have some sexy time on the hay. After that Altaïr jumps off the tower.]

Desmond Miles: Wait a second… Why aren’t I following Altaïr? I’m stuck here with Maria. Oh shit! That must mean… This is one weird dream…

[For those who don’t understand - in this dream Desmond is not Altaïr, he’s his sperm. Delightful. Desmond wakes up on his bed.]

Rebecca Crane: Sorry to barge in on you like this, but it’s getting late and we were— Hey. You okay?

Desmond Miles: Yeah, yeah… All good. Weird dreams. That’s all…

Rebecca Crane: Alright. I’ll let you get ready. See you in a few.

Shaun Hastings: Ah! Good of you to join us.

Desmond Miles: Sorry. Long night…

Shaun Hastings: What a professional, what a professional approach!

Rebecca Crane: Leave him alone.

Shaun Hastings: Well you’ll forgive me if I want to get some actual work done. Hmm, madness, isn’t it?

Lucy Stillman: Shaun! Please. That’s enough.

Shaun Hastings: Alright…

[Desmond returns to the Animus.]

Benvenuto (Welcome)
SERENISSIMA REPUBBLICA DI VENEZIA
1481

[Ezio and Leonardo arrive in Venice. They are carrying their belongings to the pier when a man approaches them.]

Man: Messer da Vinci?

Leonardo da Vinci: Yes?

Man: Buongiorno e ben arrivato! (Good morning and welcome!) I am Alvise. Il Signor Dona’ has asked that escort you to the workshop. Are you ready?

[Ezio and Leonardo follow Alvise.]

Alvise: Ah, Venezia! What other place is as beautiful, as stable, as perfect! Come! I will show you her wonders! Our first stop: the Rialto Bridge! Behold the elegance with which she spans the Grand Canal! A symbol of Venetian unity and pride. Let us continue. Here we are: San Giacomo di Rialto! Oldest church in Venezia. Isn’t she beautiful? And her clock tower? Magnifico! Come come! There’s more to see!

[Some time later…]

Alvise: No other city can match the size of Venezia’s markets. Be it spices or silk, from near and far, there is… there is…

[He notices a group of armed soldiers approaching the merchants.]

Soldier: You were told to stay home!

Marchant: But the rent is paid. I have every right to sell here!

Soldier: Emilio disagrees.

[He strikes the fish counter several times with his sword, scattering the goods.]

Marchant: No! No! Stop! Stop!

Alvise: Let us continue the tour… elsewhere.

[Ezio follows Alvise. Leonardo sees a dummy on the counter.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Look! Isn’t it amazing? Would you mind buying it for me? I… uh… I left my money with my bags.

[Several men run past Ezio.]

Ezio Auditore: Hey! Mind your step, coglione! (jerk!)

[One of the runners turns around. It’s a woman. Ezio is terrified, looking for his bag of money.]

Alvise: And here we have Palazzo della Seta. Home to Emilio Barbarigo. Normally, I’d suggest a closer look. But with the way things are now…

Ezio Auditore: Why? What’s happened?

Alvise: He’s attempting to unify the merchants beneath single banner There’s been resistance. Some of it violent.

Ezio Auditore: What kind of resistance?

Alvise: They say they’re fighting for the people. For freedom or some such nonsense. Baggianate (Nonsense), if you ask me.

[The merchant whose stand had recently been trashed by a soldier came to complain to other soldiers.]

Marchant: They destroyed my stand! I demand compensation!

Soldier 2: Here you are, then.

[He hits him in the stomach with the shaft of his spear.]

Merchant: The Doge will know about this! I’ll report you to the Council!

Soldier 2: Good luck with that, my friend.

[The other soldiers grab the merchant.]

Merchant: What are you doing?!

Soldier 2: You’re under arrest for disrupting commerce.

Merchant: What?! You just invented that! There’s no such law!

Soldier 2: There is now.

Merchant: No! Stop!

[Ezio watches the whole thing and moves on with Leonardo and Alvise.]

Alvise: And now, I present to you, your workshop. Ser da Vinci! We spared no expense in its design. You’ll see! It is perfect; as if you never left Firenze. I wish you great success and hope you enjoy Venezia as much as she enjoys having you!

[Alvise bows and leaves.]

Leonardo da Vinci: So here we are! Exciting, isn’t it? Care to come in?

Ezio Auditore: Maybe later. I need to visit the Palazzo della Seta. Try and gain an audience with Emilio.

Leonardo da Vinci: As you wish. But should you find yourself with free time, or another Codex page, don’t hesitate to visit. My door is always open.

Ezio Auditore: Grazie, (Thanks,) my friend.

[Leonardo waits for a hug, but Ezio is not going to hug him.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Di nulla! (It’s nothing!)

[“Benvenuto” synchronized.]
That’s Gonna Leave A Mark
[Ezio goes to the Palazzo della Seta. It’s heavily guarded.]

Ezio Auditore: How best to get inside? I’ll scale the wall, and… Oh, that’s not good. I’ll never make that jump. I need to find another way…

[Suddenly several of the runners that Ezio encountered earlier distract the guards. The girl who stole Ezio’s money is also with them. She deftly climbs the wall. The archers on the roof try and, after several unsuccessful shots, hit her in the knee. The girl falls to the ground and runs away, colliding with Ezio.]

Girl: I need your help.

Ezio Auditore: Hey, I remember you…

Girl: We need to go.

Ezio Auditore: You never did apologize for knocking me over.

Girl: Now.

Ezio Auditore: Va bene. (Okay.) Where to?

Girl: The water.

Ezio Auditore: That doesn’t exactly narrow it down…

[Ezio helps a girl defeat some soldiers and they escape.]

Girl: Quickly! They’re getting closer! Goddamn archers… What are you doing?! Hurry up! I’d be better off on my own!

[She begins to limp and then sits down on the paved street.]

Ezio Auditore: Can you walk?


Girl: What do you think?!

[Ezio takes her in his arms.]

Ezio Auditore: I never did catch your name…

Girl: Rosa.

Ezio Auditore: Onorato, (Honored to meet you.) Rosa. I’m Ezio.

Rosa: I know.

[Ezio carries her in his arms and they are attacked by soldiers. Ezio has to put Rosa on the ground.]

Rosa: I hope you weren’t planning on leaving me here! Pick me up!

[They come to the water. Rose notices a young man.]

Rosa: Ugo!

Ugo: What’s this?!

Ezio Auditore: Rosa’s been wounded.

Ugo: Pass her here. We’ll go the rest of the way in the boat.

[He passes Rosa to Ugo.]

Ezio Auditore: Careful. Go! I’ll deal with the guards!

[Ezio protects Ugo’s gondola.]

Rosa: (from gondola) Kill them Ezio! Quickly! Keep going, Ezio! Clear the way for us! Figlio di pottana! (Son of a bitch!). Stop them! They’re all over the rooftops! Do something! Quickly! They’re shooting at us!

[Ugo’s gondola enters a secret port. One of the conspirators is dead.]

Rosa: He’s dead, idiota (idiot). Say a prayer later. I need to see Antonio… Porco demonio! (Goddamnit!)

[She screams in pain as Ugo tries to carry her.]

Ezio Auditore: Be careful! Let me do it. Go and find Antonio.

Rosa: Oh Cristo, Ugo! Do as he says!

Ugo: Qua l’ultimo arrivato dagli ordini… (Can’t believe I’m taking orders from this guy…)

Rosa: So tired… (loses consciousness)

Ezio Auditore: Hey! Hey! Wake up!

[He carries Rosa down a narrow street.]

Ezio Auditore: We need help!

Ugo: Where’s Antonio?! Make yourselves useful! Clear a space for her. Put her down, there.

[Ezio puts Rosa on a table.]

Rosa: Where are we…?

Ezio Auditore: Home. They’ve sent for help.

Rosa: Thank you…
Antonio de Magianis: Rosa! What’s happened?

Rosa: Just get this thing out of me!

Antonio de Magianis: Soon, soon. Let’s have a look first. Clean entry and exit through the thigh. That’s good.

Rosa: (angrily) Get. It. Out.

Antonio de Magianis: Rosa, we must take care not

Rosa: (screams) NOW!

Antonio de Magianis: Come vuoi. (As you wish.) Tenetela. (Hold it.)

[He quickly breaks the arrow and pulls it out of Rosa’s leg. She screams.]

Antonio de Magianis: I am sorry, piccola (sweetheart)…

Rosa: (angrily) Sorry?! Ficcatelo nel culo your sorry! (You can shove your sorry up your ass!)

Antonio de Magianis: Go fetch Bianca and be quick! (to Ezio) Help me with this!

Ezio Auditore: How?

Antonio de Magianis: Take a clean piece of linen. When I remove my hand, press the cloth into her wound. Are you ready? Now! Ben fatto! (Well done!) You work well under pressure! She’s spirited, this one.

Rosa: Porca puttana! (Son of a bitch!)

Antonio de Magianis: Avanti! (Come on!) Get Rosa inside so that Bianca can close the wound. (to Rosa) You’ll be alright. The worst is past.

Rosa: Ti venisse il canchero, brutto bastardo! (I hope you catch plague, you bastard…) …a te e a quella grandissima troia di tua madre! (You and your whore mother!)

Antonio de Magianis: (to Ezio) Thank you. Rosa is most dear to me. I had lost her…

Ezio Auditore: (sighs) I’ve always had a soft spot for women in distress…

Antonio de Magianis: So I’ve heard. Don’t look so surprised. We know all about you, Ser Ezio. Your work in Firenze and the rest of Tuscany. Good work too, if a little unrefined.

Ezio Auditore: Then you know why I’m in Venezia?

Antonio de Magianis: I can guess. When you have a minute, come see me in my office. There’s something we should discuss.

[“That’s Gonna Leave A Mark” synchronized.]

Building Blocks
Antonio de Magianis: Avanti, Ezio. (Come in, Ezio.) Prego. (Welcome.) Can I offer you something? Biscotti? Un caffè? (A coffee?)

Ezio Auditore: What’s caffè (coffee)?

Antonio de Magianis: An interesting concoction, brought to me by a Turk merchant. Here, have a taste.

[He offers Ezio a cup. He takes a sip.]

Ezio Auditore: A little bitter if you ask me. It just seems lacking somehow… I don’t know. Have you considered adding sugar, maybe. Or latte (milk)?

Antonio de Magianis: I suppose it is something of an acquired taste. Enough about that… Now where were we?
[He walks to a table with a map of Venezia made of rough wooden shapes.]

Antonio de Magianis: Our failure at the Palazzo cost us dearly. It will take time to recover. No doubt Emilio will use this pause to strengthen his defenses… …and continue his oppression of the district. You may not share our motive, but I know you share our goal.

Ezio Auditore: Why not gather your forces and try again?

Antonio de Magianis: To act in haste would only bring more losses. No. We must resupply and draw new plans.

Ezio Auditore: I can ill afford to sit around and wait…

Antonio de Magianis: Nor would I want you to Work with us instead. Already my men begin to mend today’s wounds. Seek them out. They’ll put you to work. The sooner you aid them, the sooner we can strike.

Ezio Auditore: Molto bene, Messere. (Very well, Sir.) I accept.

Antonio de Magianis: It is the right decision.

[“Building Blocks” synchronized.]

Cleaning House
Antonio de Magianis: Ah, Ezio! I was hoping you might return. I want your advice on something.

Ezio Auditore: Of course. Tell me what troubles you.

Antonio de Magianis: Emilio has turned some of my own men against me.

Ezio Auditore: Bribery and blackmail is it?

Antonio de Magianis: Yes and we cannot strike until the traitors are dealt with. They’re still somewhere in this district - keeping tabs on us and reporting back to Emilio.

Ezio Auditore: Not for much longer, they’re not.

[He kills 3 traitors around the town. “Cleaning House” synchronized. After that, he climbs onto the roof of one of the houses, to the dovecote, where Hugo is already waiting for him.]

Breakout
Ezio Auditore: Ben trovato (Good to see you) Ugo. What’s the trouble?

Ugo: You and Rosa managed to escape from Seta. But the others were not so lucky. Emilio’s captured them and now they await execution.

Ezio Auditore: Do you know where they’re being held?

Ugo: I know they’re still in the district, but beyond that, no. You’ll have to look for them.

Ezio Auditore: I’ll have your brothers back here in no time.

[Walking the streets Ezio sees a big cage…]

Thief: The markets belong to the people! Emilio says he seeks unity, but all he really wants is control!

[Ezio releases 4 thieves and escorts them to the hiding place on the roof.]

Guard: Hah! Listen to them squeal. Pathetic. It’s no wonder their master hides. Where is Emilio? I’d like to be rid of this trash.

[Ezio releases another 4 thieves and escorts them to safety. The last group of thieves is heavily guarded. Ezio needs to fight his way through.]

Guard 1: Where’s your master now? Perhaps we’ll mount your heads on pikes.

Guard 2: Better to hang their corpses from the palazzo windows!

[The last 4 thieves are back to safety.]

Ugo: I’m impressed. I didn’t expect you to succeed so quickly.

Ezio Auditore: I aim to please.

Ugo: I’ll let Antonio know about our progress. Come find me later. I’ve got another job for you…

Ezio Auditore: What sort of job?

Ugo: Meet me near the docks and I’ll explain.

Ezio Auditore: Molto bene. (Very well.)

[“Breakout” synchronized. Ezio finds Ugo angen at the docks.]

Clothes Make The Man
Ugo: Rescuing my brothers was more than just an act of charity, Ezio. The men you freed will play a vital role in the weeks to come. Just ask for their help and they’ll join you.

Ezio Auditore: And once I have my little band of thieves?

Ugo: Send them towards a group of guards and they’ll create a distraction…

Ezio Auditore: …opening the way for me.

Ugo: Exactly.

Ezio Auditore: Saves me from having to bloody my sword. I like it.


Ugo: Exactly. Now I’ll tell you what to do with them… Antonio’s plan calls for a bit of deception. We’re to imitate his archers, which means we’ll need the armor that they wear. A shipment of the stuff has just been loaded into chests and now awaits delivery to Seta. Loot the chests and retrieve the outfits. When that’s finished, I’ll need you to fetch me a boat as well and bring it back here. We’ll use it to move our men into the Palazzo undetected.

Ezio Auditore: Consider it done.

[Ezio runs all of Ugo’s errands. He moors the boat at the dock.]

Ugo: Molto bene (Very good), Ezio. This is exactly what we needed. I’ll let Antonio know you’ve finished the job.

[“Clothes Make The Man” synchronized. Ezio goes to the secret hideout to check on Rosa. She is already well and standing outside.]

Monkey See, Monkey Do
Ezio Auditore: Salute, Rosa. (Hello, Rosa.) You seem to be healing well.

Rosa: How are you finding Venezia?

Ezio Auditore: It has its charms. But how do you deal with the smell? Che schifo! (How disgusting!)

Rosa: So what brings you to me?

Ezio Auditore: I was hoping you could help with something…

Rosa: (playful) And that would be...?

Ezio Auditore: (touches her chin) I want to learn to climb the way you do.

Rosa: Oh. Va bene. (Alright) I can do that. Well, I can’t. But Franco can. Franco! Muovi il culo! (Move your ass, Franco!) Show Ezio how to reach the top of that scaffolding. Begin in a hanging position. Then jump to the ledge above you. As you reach it, grab it with your hand and pull yourself up. There. See how it works?

Ezio Auditore: I think so...

Rosa: Only one way to find out. Try it yourself.

[Ezio tries a new move - Climb Leap.]

Rosa: Jump, Ezio! Grab the ledge at the height of your jump!

[Ezio climbs the scaffolding.]

Ezio Auditore: So? How did I do?

Rosa: I’ve seen better.

Ezio Auditore: You wound me with your cruel cruel words!

Rosa: Alright, smargiasso (showoff). Let’s put your skills to the test.

Ezio Auditore: I’m all ears.

Rosa: Meet me in front of the Frari.

[“Monkey See, Monkey Do” synchronized.]

By Leaps And Bounds
Rosa: Climbing a bit of scaffolding is all well and good, but let’s see how you do out in the open.

Ezio Auditore: Top of that tower, then? Torno fra un attimo. (I’ll be right back.)

[Ezio climbs a tower and jumps off of it to prove to Rosa he learned his lesson.]

Ezio Auditore: So?

Rosa: Looks like you’ve learned all I have to teach. I’ll let Antonio know about your progress. Finish with your other tasks. We’re almost there.

[“By Leaps And Bounds” synchronized. Ezio returns to Antonio.]

Everything Must Go
Antonio de Magianis: Please, enter! Your good work has restored us to our former strength, Ezio. We are ready to strike.

Ezio Auditore: Just tell me what needs to be done and I’ll see that it is.

Antonio de Magianis: You’ll approach from above, under the cover of night. Emilio has posted archers around the Palazzo. Kill them. But do so quietly. As they fall, my men shall replace them.

Ezio Auditore: What about the guards?

Antonio de Magianis: When you’ve finished with the archers, we’ll regroup in front of this building, here - and discuss next steps.

Ezio Auditore: Nessun problema. (Not a problem.) I’ll take care of the archers and return to you.

Antonio de Magianis: Then it’s settled. In bocca al lupo. (Best of luck.)

[Ezio kills 5 archers and finds Antonio.]

Antonio de Magianis: Well done, Ezio! Everything is going according to plan. As we speak, my men are replacing the archers you’ve removed. The way to the Palazzo is clear now.

Ezio Auditore: But not the building itself. Emilio’s guards still patrol its border.

Ugo: Use my men. They can distract the guards - save you from having to fight.

Rosa: And when it comes time to storm the place, remember what I’ve taught you!

Antonio de Magianis: Sii cauto (Take care), Ezio. We await word of your success.

[Ezio climbs onto the roof of the palazzo and overhears the conversation.]

Carlo Grimaldi: Your little house of cards is crumbling, Emilio...

Emilio Barbarigo: A minor setback. It will be dealt with. This povero scemo (poor fool). Antonio, and his thieves...

Carlo Grimaldi: Nevermind them! It’s the Assassin you should be worried about!

Emilio Barbarigo: Why? Is... Is he in Venezia?

Carlo Grimaldi: He’s been here for weeks! How could you be so blind?

[As they talk, Ezio kills the guards.]

Emilio Barbarigo: Unlike you, I’ve been busy! Someone had to provide the weapons to our brothers in Firenze.

Carlo Grimaldi: Yes. And we all saw what good that did...

Emilio Barbarigo: Enough with the barbs! What is it you want, Carlo?

Carlo Grimaldi: Maestro has called a meeting. Three days from now at Santo Stefano.

Emilio Barbarigo: Very well. I’ll be there.

Carlo Grimaldi: Assuming you still live. If you want my advice, I’d find a less conspicuous place to wait Seta is a target now.

Emilio Barbarigo: Seta is a fortress!

Carlo Grimaldi: If you say so… Goodbye Emilio.

Emilio Barbarigo: Cazzo! (Fuck!) What if he’s right… You! Call for my boat. It should be close. When it arrives, load those crates and prepare to sail. I’ll be right back. If Carlo speaks true, I must find a place to hide... Just until the meeting... Then we’ll deal with the Assassin... He must be working with Antonio... That means the attacks… No! I’ve worked too hard for this…

[At that moment, Ezio jumps out of a nearby window with a drawn blade. He stabs Emilio’s throat.]

Ezio Auditore: Do not be afraid.

Emilio Barbarigo: I feel no fear, assassin. Only regret. I sought unity. Stability. Order.

Ezio Auditore: At too great a cost.

Emilio Barbarigo: Progress demands sacrifice.

Ezio Auditore: Non trovo alcuna gioia in questo, ma non c’è altro modo. (I take no joy in this, but I see no other way.) Requiescat in Pace. (Rest in peace.)

[While Ezio is reciting a prayer, a guard sneaks up on him, but Rosa kills him with a bow.]

Rosa: Sorry! We couldn’t resist. Come! Let’s open the gate for Antonio.

[They let Antonio and the others into the palazzo.]

Antonio de Magianis: Seta is fallen and Emilio is no more! All thanks to you, Ezio! (to his men) Go! Tear down Emilio’s banners! Return what he has stolen from the people… Tell me, Ezio... How can I repay you for your service?

Ezio Auditore: Money’s always nice.

Antonio de Magianis: Easy enough.

[One of Antonio’s men gives Ezio a tight bag of coins.]

Antonio de Magianis: What else?

Ezio Auditore: Emilio was meeting with a man named Carlo. He looked to be a government official. Do you know him?

Antonio de Magianis: Carlo Grimaldi. He sits on the Council of Ten. Why do you ask? What are you up to?

Ezio Auditore: I have a meeting to attend. (bows)

[“Everything Must Go” synchronized. Memory Sequence 7 completed!]

Memory Sequence 08: Necessity, Mother of Invention
Birds of A Feather
[Ezio begins to follow Carlo. He meets some obese man in a cape.]

Obese Man: Where’s Emilio?

Carlo Grimaldi: I told him to be here.

Obese Man: You told him yourself? In person?

Carlo Grimaldi: Yes, myself, in person... I’m concerned that you don’t trust me.

Obese Man: As am I. Perhaps he’ll arrive with the others. Walk with me...

[Ezio follows the group.]

Obese Man: So, how go things in the palace?

Carlo Grimaldi: Honestly, it’s difficult... Mocenigo keeps his circle close. I have tried to lay the groundwork, making suggestions, but he has other voices at his ears.

Obese Man: Then you must work harder you must become part of his inner circle

Carlo Grimaldi: Si. (Yes.) I understand. But it’s harder than I expected.

Obese Man: And why is that, Carlo?

Carlo Grimaldi: I don’t know! He just a... The Doge doesn’t like me.

Obese Man: I wonder why.

Carlo Grimaldi: It’s not my fault! I keep trying to please him. I learn what he craves, and I have it delivered -- The finest jams from the orchards of Sardinia! The newest fashions from Milano--

Obese Man: Yes, and that’s called being a sycophant.

Carlo Grimaldi: A what--? What did you call me--?

Obese Man: A doormat. A flatterer. A bootlicker. Need I go on?

Carlo Grimaldi: Bastardo... You don’t know what it’s like. You don’t understand the pressure in there--

Obese Man: (angrily) Oh, I don’t understand pressure!?

Carlo Grimaldi: No. You have no idea. You are a government official. I am two steps from the Doge himself. I am beside him day and night. You WISH you could be where I am--

Obese Man: Are you done?

Carlo Grimaldi: Hardly. You listen to me now. I’m close! The Doge can be recruited to our cause, I’m sure of it. I just… I need a little more time.

Obese Man: Time is not a thing we have in great supply. Keep moving.

Carlo Grimaldi: Is it much further?

Obese Man: Don’t be such a little girl.

[They go out into the square and meet two other people, an old man dressed in rich clothes and a middle-aged man.]

Old Man: Buon giorno (Good day), cousin. - Signor Carlo

Obese Man: We thought Emilio would be with you--

Old Man: Emilio is dead.

Obese Man: What? How--?

Carlo Grimaldi: The Assassin... The same one who hunted down the Pazzi! He’s here, in Venezia

Old Man: È così. (It is so.) Silvio - did you not know? He could be anywhere. He could be here right now, and we might not even know. He struck Emilio inside his own palazzo!

Silvio Barbarigo (Obese Man): And so, what of our plans!?

Old Man: There is no longer time for subtlety, my brothers. We must act now.

Carlo Grimaldi: But, Marco. I’m so close. A few more days. If I can just--

Marco Barbarigo (Old Man): No. It happens this week.

Middle Aged Man: We should keep moving.

[They walk away. Ezio follows them.]

Marco Barbarigo: And what does The Spaniard have to say of this change of plan?

Silvio Barbarigo: You can ask him yourself soon enough.

Carlo Grimaldi: He’s here!? From Roma?

Marco Barbarigo: So I’ve heard.

Silvio Barbarigo: Good! Then perhaps he’s made a decision.

Marco Barbarigo: About what cousin?

Silvio Barbarigo: About which of us shall step into the robes of the Doge. "Cousin."

Marco Barbarigo: I didn’t know there was a decision to be made. Surely the choice is obvious to all.

Silvio Barbarigo: Obvious, indeed. It should be the one who organized the entire operation. The one who came up with the idea of how to save this city!

Marco Barbarigo: There is no lack of value in tactical intelligence, good Silvio. But it is wisdom one needs to rule. Do not think otherwise.

Carlo Grimaldi: Calma! Calm, amici (Calm! Calm, friends), please. There’s no need for this. You know, it’s not up to either of you... For all we know, he may not even choose a Barbarigo. And why not me? I’m the one who’s done all the hard work.

Marco Barbarigo: Basta. (Enough.) We wait for his arrival.

Carlo Grimaldi: Are you sure he’s coming?

Marco Barbarigo: Yes!

Middle Aged Man: Signori (Gentlemen), we should move a little faster. I feel eyes on us.

Marco Barbarigo: Thank you, Dante. We will move at your pace.

Silvio Barbarigo: This guard’s a good find, cousin. How much did you pay for him?

Marco Barbarigo: Perhaps not as much as he deserves. He’s saved my life on two occassions. Though he’s not much of a conversationalist

[They meet their boss, Rodrigo Borgia himself.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Enough with your inane prattle! The choice of Doge was never up to any of you. -- And you were never given permission to make plans!

Marco Barbarigo: Forgive us, Maestro. We wish only to serve.

Rodrigo Borgia: The plan is this: Doge Mocenigo will die tonight. And once the deed’s been done, Marco shall take his place.

Marco Barbarigo: Vi ringrazio umilmente, Maestro. (I humbly thank you, Master).

Rodrigo Borgia: Good! Messer Grimaldi. You are closest to Mocenigo, your work the most vital. Serve us well, and it won’t be forgotten. - Walk with me.

[Ezio continues to follow the Templars.]

Rodrigo Borgia: I don’t want any blood spilled. You understand? It must appear to all that he goes quietly.

Carlo Grimaldi: Certo, Maestro...

Rodrigo Borgia: When are you closest to him?

Carlo Grimaldi: I have full run of the palace. He may not care to hear what I have to say, but he trusts me by now as one of his own.

Rodrigo Borgia: Bravo. Then I want you to infiltrate the kitchen and poison his meal.

Carlo Grimaldi: So be it.

Rodrigo Borgia: Marco. Can you furnish us with a suitable toxin on short notice?

Marco Barbarigo: I defer to my cousin. That is really his area of expertise.

Rodrigo Borgia: Ah, Silvio...

Silvio Barbarigo: I am at your service, Maestro.

Rodrigo Borgia: What can you bring to get this done?

Silvio Barbarigo: I will confer with my associates in the streets. But chances are good that I can procure some Cantarella...

Rodrigo Borgia: Yes, and what is that?

Silvio Barbarigo: It is a most effective form of arsenic and difficult to trace.

Rodrigo Borgia: Ah..! Va bene, va bene. (Alright, alright.) Then it’s decided.

Marco Barbarigo: Forgive me, Maestro. But is this not perhaps a tad dangerous for you? Involving your sell so intimately with the minutiae of our plans?

Rodrigo Borgia: I feel the need to involve myself more directly... The Pazzi disappointed us in Firenze. I pray you will not do the same.

Silvio Barbarigo: Don’t worry this time. The Pazzi were a bunch of foolish...

Rodrigo Borgia: The Pazzi were a potent and venerable family, reduced to rubble by one young assassin. Do not underestimate this troublesome foe - who now haunts your city - or the same fate will befall the Barbarigo. I want this done promptly. Bene. I must return to Roma. Time is of the essence. - Do not fail us.

[The other Templar bows. Rodrigo Borgia leaves and a flock of pigeons soars into the air.]

Ezio Auditore: Che idiota sono! (What an idiot I am! I should have kept my eyes on them. I need to go and see Antonio if I’ve any hope of salvaging this mess I’ve made…

[“Birds of A Feather” synchronized. Ezio runs to the palazzo.]

If At First You Don’t Succeed…
Rosa: Salute, bello mio. Come stai? (Hello beautiful. How are you?) You back to see me already?

Ezio Auditore: (friendly kisses Rosa) Desolato, mia cara (Sorry, my dear), but I am not here to play. I must speak with Antonio. It’s urgent.

Rosa: Antonio! Ezio’s here!

Antonio de Magianis: Ezio! Is everything alright?

Ezio Auditore: Carlo Grimaldi and the Barbarigo are in league with the one they call The Spaniard. They’re going to murder the Doge - and replace him with one of their own. They will have all of Venezia - her entire fleet - in their grasp.

Antonio de Magianis: And they call me a criminal...

Ezio Auditore: Then, you’ll help me.

Antonio de Magianis: You have me on your side, brother. And the support of all my men.

Rosa: And women!

Ezio Auditore: Grazie, amici! (Thank you, friends.)

Antonio de Magianis: But, Ezio, I must warn you. It’s not going to be so easy this time. Palazzo Ducale is the most heavily guarded building in Venezia.

Ezio Auditore: Nothing is impenetrable.

Rosa: (laughs) This is why we like you, Ezio!

Antonio de Magianis: Come! Let’s go take a look. We’ll come up with a plan.

[Ezio accompanies Antonio to the Piazza San Marco.]

Antonio de Magianis: This business with the Doge... Terrible. Though treachery like this no longer surprises me. When I was a child, we were taught that the nobles were just and kind. I believed it, too. Though my father was only a cobbler and my mother a scullery maid, aspired to be much more… I studied hard. I persevered - but the nobles would never have me, if you are not born one of them, acceptance is impossible. So I ask you. Ezio - who are the true nobles of Venezia? Men like Carlo Grimaldi and Marco Barbarigo? No! I say WE are: The thieves and marcenari and whores. While we work to save this city and its people, the nobles seek to make it their plaything…

[They arrive at the Piazza San Marco.]

Antonio de Magianis: We need to scout the palazzo carefully, see it from every angle. We just might find a way in. I know of a tall Campanile behind the palazzo. Or we might find a way to climb the back of the Basilica. Do you have any ideas?

Ezio Auditore: I assume the front door is out?

Antonio de Magianis: (laughs) Va bene! We’ll try the front door as well, saputello (wise ass).

[Ezio scouts the Palazzo with Antonio.]

Ezio Auditore: So, what do you think?

Antonio de Magianis: We’re not getting in this way. They’ll have time to murder the doge before we’re able to get through all these guards.

[They climb on a tall tower to get a better look.]

Antonio de Magianis: Look at that. Archers everywhere!

Ezio Auditore: And the walls are impossible to climb on this side.

[They enter the Basilica.]

Antonio de Magianis: Bene... We’re in luck. Looks like there’s a perfect path up the scaffolding to the roof of the Basilica. Shall we?

[They climb up the scaffolding.]

Antonio de Magianis: Ezio, look! Isn’t that him -- Grimaldi?

[Carlo speaks with the Doge himself, Giovanni Mocenigo.]

Carlo Grimaldi: Don’t you understand what I’m offering you, Signore! Listen to me, please! Or this will be your last chance!

Giovanni Mocenigo: How dare you!

Carlo Grimaldi: I’m sorry, mi dispiace (I’m sorry). I meant nothing by it. I’m only looking out for your safety…

[They go out of sight.]

Antonio de Magianis: We’re running out of time! There’s no way through this fence - and there are guards everywhere. Diavolo!

[Ezio and Antonio get out of the Basilica.]

Antonio de Magianis: It’s impossible! There’s no way in or out for men -- only birds!

Ezio Auditore: Yes... birds.

Antonio de Magianis: Where are you going now!?

Ezio Auditore: To see my friend Leonardo.
Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained
[Ezio visits his old friend, Leonardo da Vinci.]

Ezio Auditore: I need your help, Leonardo. Does it work?

Leonardo da Vinci: What? What are you asking?

Ezio Auditore: Does - it - work? Leonardo. Can it really fly!?

Leonardo da Vinci: I don’t know... It’s only a prototype. An idea. It’s not ready yet.

Ezio Auditore: Have you tried it?

Leonardo da Vinci: No! It’s too dangerous. To test it, you’d have to leap off a tower! Who would be mad enough to do a thing like that?

Ezio Auditore: Leonardo... I think you just found your madman.

[After a while they are already standing on top of the building. Leonardo’s glider is ready to fly.]

Ezio Auditore: So how does she work?

Leonardo da Vinci: Have you ever watched a bird in flight? It’s not about being lighter than air... It’s about grace and balance! You must use your body’s own weight to control your elevation and direction. Good luck, Ezio.

[Ezio grabs the handle of the glider,jumps off the building... and flies.]

Ezio Auditore: Aaarrggh! Why am I crashing!? This is ridiculous! The Palazzo’s too far away! Diavolo! (Damn!) I give up! I’m gonna end up killing myself before ever kill another Templar.

[But Leonardo is very happy about the results. “Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained” synchronized and continues for the next mission.]
Well Begun Is Half Done
Leonardo da Vinci: I can’t believe it! It worked! It really worked! You flew, Ezio! You flew!

Ezio Auditore: Si... (Yes...) But not very far.

Leonardo da Vinci: Well, what were you expecting? The machine wasn’t designed for distance. Alright, look, let me go over my plans here. Maybe I can find some way to extend the duration of the flight.

Antonio de Magianis: Ezio! My men tell me Carlo has the poison. We must hurry.

Ezio Auditore: Antonio, this is Leonardo. The master inventor... who built this... this… (almost silent) pezzo di merda! (piece of shit!)

Leonardo da Vinci: Hey! It’s not the machine’s fault... It’s mine. I’ve checked and rechecked my blueprints. It’s just impossible! I don’t know how to extend the flight... Ah, che idea del cazzo! (Crazy fucking idea!)

[He throws his blueprints into the fire and sees the burnt sheet soar over the fire.]

Leonardo da Vinci: EUREKA! Of course! Genio! (Genius!)

Antonio de Magianis: What is he doing now?

Leonardo da Vinci: (writing) Heat rises. It needs fire! Heated air under its wings will lift the machine...

Ezio Auditore: Leonardo... What good is one fire going to do?

Leonardo da Vinci: Not one fire, Ezio. A dozen! Built all across the city! Enough to carry you from here all the way to the Palazzo Ducale.

Antonio de Magianis: How...? Oh, capisco! My men could do that... But you’re forgetting about the guards.

Ezio Auditore: Don’t worry. I will take care of them.

Antonio de Magianis: I’ll give the order to have my men move in behind you, and hold the locations. They’ll light them all up the second the sun goes down over San Marco…

[Ezio clears four locations of guards.]

Guard: This is ridiculous! Vincenzo was supposed to take my shift an hour ago. My wife is going to murder me if I miss dinner again.

Guard: E che ti frega? (Why should you give a shit?) Just go. It’s not like we’re guarding the Doge.

Guard: What the hell are we guarding anyway?

Guard: A shipment from China. Some kind of colored powder they brought over for a big party - really expensive! You ask me, the way these nobles spend their money…

[“Well Begun Is Half Done” synchronized. Finally, it was time for a new flight. Evening. Leonardo’s glider is back on the roof.]

Infrequent Flier
Antonio de Magianis: It’s time.

Leonardo da Vinci: You did it! It’s beautiful!

Antonio de Magianis: Si! (Yes! Now let’s hope your idea works. Because we’re nearly out of time.

Leonardo da Vinci: Listen close Ezio: You’re going to want to fly from fire to fire. The heat of each one you pass over should lift you back up in the air again.

Ezio Auditore: Bene. (Got it.)

Antonio de Magianis: Careful though! There’s archers out on the roofs tonight. Avoid those arrows, or it’ll be a short trip.

Ezio Auditore: I wish there was some way I could use my sword while flying this thing.

Leonardo da Vinci: Well... you do have your feet free. If you get close enough without taking an arrow in the head - maybe you could kick them off the building?

Ezio Auditore: Nice.

Antonio de Magianis: It’s now or never, amico mio (my friend).

[Ezio uses the glider and flies to Palazzo Ducale to assassinate Carlo Grimaldi.]

Guard: (shocked) Ma cosa!? (What the- ?) Shoot! Shoot the flying demon!

[Ezio successfully lands in the palazzo, but his glider crashes, scaring the guards half to death.]

Giovanni Mocenigo: What was that?!

Carlo Grimaldi: Don’t worry. Probably just kids with firecrackers. Come, it’s your move.

[Ezio, meanwhile, walks across the roof and jumps through the window. He notices that the Doge is about to take a sip from the cup.]

Ezio Auditore: STOP! Signore, don’t drink that!

Carlo Grimaldi: You are too late. The Doge is dead.

[He drops one of the chess pieces from the board.]

Giovanni Mocenigo: What? Carlo...?

Carlo Grimaldi: Apologies, Signore. But you should have listened to me when you had the chance.

[The Doge drops his cup.]

Carlo Grimaldi: Seems you have failed, Assassin. (runs away)

Ezio Auditore: Forgive me, Signore. I tried....

Giovanni Mocenigo: Why...? What was it all for...?

[He starts coughing blood.]

Guard: Assassino! Assassino! He’s killed the Doge! The Doge is dead!

[Ezio runs after old Carlo and assassinates him without any effort.]

Ezio Auditore: It takes one Assassin to kill another, it seems.

Carlo Grimaldi: We kill thinking it’s best for us, do we not, Messer Ezio?

Ezio Auditore: I do this not for myself. Compio questo sacrificio per il bene superiore. (I make this sacrifice for the greater good.) Requiescat in Pace. (Rest in peace.)

[That’s when Dodge comes out. His clothes are covered in blood. He points to Ezio and Grimaldi.]

Giovanni Mocenigo: You... You killed me? You killed ME!?

[Ezio is surrounded by guards. He draws his sword. Having won, he escapes from the palazzo and is lost in the crowd. “Infrequent Flier” synchronized. Memory Sequence 8 completed! Also Ezio got a Codex page… somehow. Maybe he stole it for the Palazzo, I don’t know.]

SERENISSIMA REPUBBLICA DI VENEZIA
1486

[Ezio visits his friend Leonardo... five years later apparently.]

Leonardo da Vinci: Ezio! Dio mio! (My God!) You’re alive! - Is it true? They say you killed the Doge?

Ezio Auditore: I was trying to save him, Leonardo. But the truth matters little. I failed. And now I’m the most wanted man in Venezia.

Leonardo da Vinci: Well, perhaps you are in luck! It’s Carnevale in Venezia. This is the time when everybody goes without a face!

Ezio Auditore: That’s why I’m here. Do you have a mask I can wear?

Leonardo da Vinci: Of course, of course, somewhere in here...

Ezio Auditore: Grazie, amico mio. (Thanks, my friend.) And I have something for you.

Leonardo da Vinci: Ohhh! More of the Codex! Aha... This one’s quite complex... Hmmmm... It’s a new design, my friend... A mechanism for your wrist, but not a blade... In fact, it seems to be a kind of arma da fuoco (firearm) - but as small as a hummingbird!

Ezio Auditore: Is that possible?

Leonardo da Vinci: I have no idea. Let’s build it and find out!

[Now Ezio has a pistol. He practices shooting 3 summies and returns to Leonardo.]

Ezio Auditore: You’ve done me good, brother.

Leonardo da Vinci: Ma certo. (Of course.) But I’m sure your return was not just to play with new toys. Is it about this terrible new Doge they’ve installed... Marco Barbarigo? Then you’ll want to speak with your friend Antonio. I’ve seen him quite a bit lately at a, um, mutual friend’s. I’d look for him there - in the Dorsoduro district - to the south. Ask for Sister Teodora.

Ezio Auditore: Sister?

Leonardo da Vinci: Well, um... In a way. Yes, sister… And Ezio, you can’t be carrying weapons out there today.

Ezio Auditore: Grazie. (Thanks.) Leonardo. Now, about that mask...

[“Knowledge Is Power” synchronized. Ezio finds Antonio in a brothel… a church.]

Damsels In Distress
Ezio Auditore: Antonio. We need to talk.

[He takes off his mask.]

Antonio de Magianis: Ezio!? - Ezio Auditore! Teodora, meet the most… ahem... talented man in all of Venezia!

Ezio Auditore: Madonna... Ah! "Sister" Teodora… I never imagined you as a religious type.

Sister Teodora: It depends how you understand religion, my son. It’s not just men’s souls that call for soothing.

Antonio de Magianis: Come! Join us, Ezio! Have a drink! Meet the ladies!

[Suddenly a man runs out of the rooms upstairs. A woman’s scream is heard.]

Whore: Murderer! Butcher! He sliced Lucia and stole her money!

Sister Teodora: So - Messer Ezio - Let’s see just how talented you are. After him!

[Ezio runs after the murderer. He cuts different women as he runs away.]

Murderer: Don’t come any closer, or I will carve up another one. Don’t make me kill again. Who the hell are you? Get away from me! Stay back! Or I will kill them - I swear it. It wasn’t my fault. She laughed at me! She made me do it. Another one’s blood will be on your hands! What are you? Some kind of benefattore del cazzo (fucking do gooder)? Leave me alone!

[Ezio assassinates the bastard. “Damsels In Distress” synchronized. Ezio returns to the church. The whores are weeping about Lucia, lying on the table.]

Nun The Wiser
Sister Teodora: You have our gratitude, Ezio.

Antonio de Magianis: Why is it wherever you go, trouble follows?

Ezio Auditore: Antonio. I trust you know why I’m here?

Antonio de Magianis: I imagine to rid Venice of Marco Barbarigo? But really, Ezio, we did this once already! And this new Templar Doge is a bigger culo (ass) than the last. Nevermind that he NEVER leaves the Palazzo.

Sister Teodora: Yes. Except... for tonight. Marco wouldn’t dare miss Carnevale.

Ezio Auditore: How do you know this?

Sister Teodora: In fact, he’s throwing the biggest party of them all. But getting in won’t be so simple. You’ll need a golden mask for entry. And before you think about forging one, keep in mind, each mask is numbered. Fortunately for you, I have an idea. Let’s see if we can’t WIN you a mask.

[They walk outside and go down the street.]

Sister Teodora: What is it my son? You want to ask me something?

Ezio Auditore: I do. Forgive me, but - why is it you wear a nun’s habit if you aren’t one?

Sister Teodora: (laughs) Well whoever said I wasn’t? Indeed, I am married to the Lord.

Ezio Auditore: And yet you are also a courtesan? You run a bordello.

Sister Teodora: So? I see no contradiction. How I choose to practice my faith - what choose to do with my body - these are my choices to make. Like many young women. I was drawn to the church, but grew disillusioned by the "believers" of this city. Men hold God only as an idea in their heads, not in the depths of their hearts and bodies. Men must know how to love in order to reach salvation. My girls and I provide that to our congregation. No church would agree with me, I realized. So I created my own. It may not be traditional, but men’s hearts grow firmer in my care.

Ezio Auditore: Among other things, I’m sure.

[They go out into the square where various festivities and contests are held.]

Caller: Signore e Signori (Ladies and gentlemen), come one come all. The Games of Carnevale are about to begin. Do you have the coraggio (courage) to compete for as grand a prize as this?

[Dante comes to the podium with a gold mask in his hands. Silvio stands nearby.]

Caller: This year - like every year - the Golden Mask will provide entry - for one, e uno solo (and only one) - to our most beloved Doge’s personal ball! Who would not desire such an exceptional reward? Come! Compete! Whoever proves themself champion in each of four games today, shall be the Doge’s personal guest tonight!

Sister Teodora: You’d best get to it, Ezio!

[“Nun The Wiser” synchronized. Ezio enters the competition.]

Ribbon Round-Up
Caller: Welcome, gentlemen. Whether you win or lose, this will certainly be your FAVORITE game of the day! - Ladies!? Here’s how the game is played. All the ladies in this district have ribbons. Your job is to obtain them. Whoever has the most before my hourglass runs out - is one step closer to winning the golden mask!

[Ezio walks around the district throwing compliments.]

Ezio Auditore: Hello, ladies. You’re all looking lovely this afternoon. Mind if I join you? Have anything for me, belle mie (my beauties)? Could I trouble you for a ribbon? You’re all looking lovely this afternoon.

Caller: We have a winner! You have more ribbons than any man here! You’ve proved yourself a favorite of the ladies! And are now one step closer to the greatest prize of all time!

[“Ribbon Round-Up” synchronized. Ezio continues the competition.]

CTF
Caller: Welcome, welcome! The rules of this game are simple: Out run your opponents, take the flag from the middle of the field and bring it back to your starting position to score. If the opposition holds the flag, you must knock them down to steal it! Be the first to capture the flag 3 times - and the golden mask may yet be yours!

[Ezio captures 3 flags which is quite easy for him.]

Caller: We have a winner! You’ve protected your flag, and captured the enemy’s. You’ve proven yourself a warrior without peer and inch ever closer to victory!

[“CTF” synchronized. Ezio continues the competition.]

And They’re Off
Caller: Who’s next? Step right up! Try for the best time. Can you beat your neighbors? Who shall win the prize? Welcome, benvenuti (welcome) Are you ready to test yourselves with a game of speed and endurance? Many challenges lie in your path! The game is simple - but finishing it - near impossible! Start when you’re ready. The first contestant to beat the course record is one step closer to the Golden Mask!

[Ezio enters the race and wins.]

Caller: The winner! You’ve proven yourself the fastest and strongest in Venezia! You are now one step closer to the grand prize!

[Silvio and Dante look at Ezio with disgust. “And They’re Off” synchronized. Ezio continues the competition.]

Cheaters Never Prosper
Caller: Step right up and join the fight! Do you have what it takes to defeat your opponents? Who will last longest in the ring? Benvenuti lottatoril (Welcome, fighters!) The game is simple. There’s only one rule: No weapons. Fight until you are the last man left standing! Will it be you? O tu? (Or you?) Hmmm? Who will win the golden mask!

[Ezio kicks some asses.]

Caller: Who else wishes to compete? Do we have another challenger?

Silvio Barbarigo: Looks like this one thinks himself some kind of campione (champion)! Go on, Dante. Show him how sadly mistaken he is.

[Ezio wipes the floor with Dante.]

Caller: Is there nobody else to challenge our man in the ring? Do we have a winner?

[Silvio privately tells something to the Caller and gives him some coins.]

Caller: Ah! We have combatants!

[A few armed guards enter the ring.]

Ezio Auditore: So that’s how it’s going to be, eh?

[Not without effort but Ezio defeats the guards.]

Caller: Signore e Signori! (Ladies and gentlemen)! The Games of Carnevale have come to a glorious conclusion! Come see our winner claim his Golden Mask! Our winner has proven himself the fleetest of foot, the strongest of champions, the wisest strategist - and clearly a favorite of the ladies. With four games won lealmente (fair and square), the winner of the Golden Mask is—

[Silvio coughs.]

Caller: The winner of the Golden Mask is - DANTE MORO!

Silvio Barbarigo: (hands over the mask) Congratulations. We’ll see you this evening.

[The crowd is outraged. “Cheaters Never Prosper” synchronized. Ezio returns to the church.]

Having A Blast
Sister Teodora: I’m sorry, Ezio. We could not have known Silvio would cheat as he did.

Antonio de Magianis: (smirks) You should have.

Whore: Sister! You told us to let you know if we saw that rottinculo (cocksucker) who stole the Golden Mask? He’s on his way to the Doge’s party!

Ezio Auditore: I will go! I can catch him before he arrives, and take back the mask.

Antonio de Magianis: How? By killing the poor stronzo (fucker)?

Ezio Auditore: Yes. You know what’s at stake.

Antonio de Magianis: No. If you kill him, they’ll cancel the party - and Marco will retreat back into his Palazzo. We’ll have wasted our time - again! Steal the mask instead. Quietly.

Sister Teodora: My girls can help. They’re already on their way to the party - all along the route. They can help you distract him while you acquire the mask.

Ezio Auditore: Va bene. (Alright.) I can do that!

[He uses the working girls to distract the guards and steal a Codex page, then he quietly steals the Golden Mask from Dante. He uses it to get past the guards.]

Guard: Buona sera, Signore. (Good evening, sir.)

Sister Teodora: You made it! - Marco is on a boat, just off shore. He’s set to make a speech in a few minutes. Use my girls until then. Move with them to stay out of sight.

[Meanwhile Dante notices that the Mask is stolen.]

Dante Moro: (to the guards) Find him.

[Ezio sneaks through the crowd of people trying not to attract the attention of the guards. Suddenly he overhears Marco’s brother, Agostino, talking to one of the guests.]

Agostino Barbarigo: Honestly, my brother embarrasses himself with this display.

???: You have no right to speak of him that way -- He’s the Doge.

Agostino Barbarigo: He is Doge in name only, and it’s Venetian money he spends. There are larger things at stake and you know it—

???: Marco was the one chosen to lead. Your father may have thought he’d never amount to much, may have foisted his political ambitions on you - but it doesn’t matter now, does it given where things stand.

Agostino Barbarigo: I never wanted to be Doge --

???: Then it seems you have succeeded wildly!

Agostino Barbarigo: Power is more than wealth. Does my brother truly believe he was chosen for any reason other than his riches?

???: He was chosen for his wisdom and leadership.

Agostino Barbarigo: And this is what he does with such wisdom? Offer a light show? He hides away in the Palazzo while the city comes apart at the seams, and then he thinks some expensive explosions will make people forget all their problems.

???: The people love spectacle. It’s human nature. You’ll see...

[The show is about to begin!]

Announcer: Signore e Signori (Ladies and gentlemen), I present to you... The beloved Doge of Venezia!

[Marco comes on stage pompous as a rooster.]

Marco Barbarigo: Benvenuti! (Welcomel) Welcome, my friends, to the grandest social event of the season! At peace or at war, in times of prosperity or paucity - Venezia will always have Carnevale!

Ezio Auditore: Merda! (Shit!) He’s not leaving the boat... I will have to swim out there...

Sister Teodora: I wouldn’t try it. You’d be spotted right away.

Ezio Auditore: Then I’ll fight my way out th—

Sister Teodora: Wait.

Marco Barbarigo: Tonight, we celebrate what makes us great. How bright our lights shine over the world!

Sister Teodora: That’s it! Your pistola (pistol! The one you stopped the murderer with. It’s as loud as those explosions. Time it right, and you’ll walk out of here unnoticed.

Ezio Auditore: I like the way you think, Sister.

Sister Teodora: I’ll be waiting for you back at the brothel, my son.

Marco Barbarigo: We all know we have come through troubled times. But we have come through them together, and Venezia stands a stronger city for it.

[Ezio shoots Marco with his concealed pistol. Plain and simple.]

Marco Barbarigo: No! It’s too soon! I’m not ready!

Ezio Auditore: We rarely are. Che la morte non sia crudele. (Death be not unkind.) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[Ezio is surrounded by soldiers. He jumps into the water and is lost from sight, after which he hands out bribes to heralds to lower his notoriety. He returns to the church.]

Whore: Beautifully done!

Whore: Che spettacolo! Che spettacolo! (What a show! What a show!)

Whore: A true hero!

Sister Teodora: You must be exhausted. Come. Relax.

Antonio de Magianis: Ah! The savior of Venezia! What can I say? Perhaps it was wrong of me to doubt so readily. Now we’ll see where all the pieces fall...

Sister Teodora: Enough of that now. You’ve worked hard, my son. I feel your tired body in need of comfort and succor.

Ezio Auditore: (strokes her breasts) But I have such aches and pains, sister, I may need a great deal of comfort and succor.

Sister Teodora: Oh, that can be arranged. -- Girls!

An Unpleasant Turn Of Events
SERENISSIMA REPUBBLICA DI VENEZIA
1486

[One of Antonio’s men approaches Ezio on a bridge.]

Antonio’s Man: Ezio! Ezio! Ser Antonio wishes to speak with you.

Ezio Auditore: Grazie (Thanks) for the message.

[Ezio finds Antonio and is surprised to see Marco’s brother, Agostino, next to him.]

Antonio de Magianis: Ah! There you are! Come, Ezio. I’d like to introduce you to an… associate. This is Agostino Barbarigo - soon to be Doge of Venezia - thanks to you.

Ezio Auditore: E un onore fare la vostra conoscenza, illustrissimo. (It is an honor to make your acquaintance, Doge.) I am sorry for the loss of your brother.

Agostino Barbarigo: He had it coming. He was bought and paid for by the Borgia, a mistake I have no intention of making.

Antonio de Magianis: Come, Ezio! We have much to discuss. We’ve located Silvio Barbarigo for you. He’s fled into L’Arsenale.

Agostino Barbarigo: Hah! Fled? You mean occupied - and joined by two hundred mercenari (mercenaries), no less.

Ezio Auditore: You’re Doge now. Can’t you command them to stand down?

Agostino Barbarigo: The committee of forty-one has yet to confirm my ascension. And this little stunt of Silvio’s has only made things worse. He has an entire army at his command!

Ezio Auditore: Then help me to raise my own.

Antonio de Magianis: I figured you’d say as much. Bartolomeo D’Alviano is the man you seek. He and his men have little love for Silvio. He resides within the military district - southwest of L’Arsenale.

Ezio Auditore: Va bene. (It’s okay.) I’ll go and see him.

[“An Unpleasant Turn Of Events” synchronized.]

Caged Fighter
[As Ezio goes towards L’Arsenale he hears some faint voice from a roof.]

Voice: Please... help...

Ezio Auditore: You must be one of Bartolomeo’s men! What’s happened here? Where is he?

Bartolomeo’s Man: Silvio’s thugs... attacked... Took him... Deeper into the district... (coughs) North of here… (dies)

[Ezio closes his eyes.]

Ezio Auditore: Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[Now Ezio needs to locate Bartolomeo and save him. He finds the place where Bartolomeo is held. It’s heavily guarded. As Ezio makes his way he heras Bartolomeo taunting the guards.]

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Luridi codardi! (Fucking cowards!) I’ll take you all on. At the same time! With one arm - no BOTH arms - tied behind my back. You must be wondering how is this EVEN POSSIBLE. Only release me and I’LL GLADY DEMONSTRATE, miserabili pezzi di merda! (you spineless pieces of shit!) You have no horor. No valor! NO VIRTUE! And people wonder why it is Venezia’s star has begun to fade. I’ll show mercy to whoever here has the COURAGE to release me. All the rest of you are GOING TO DIE! BY MY HAND! I swear it! What sort of man sells his honor and dignity for a bit of coin? You realize you are in service to a TRAITOR and a COWARD. Oh ho! Do you think I don’t know WHY you’ve chained me up! Do you think I don’t know WHO pulls Silvio’s puppet strings?! I’ve been fighting his weasel of a master since before most of you were even GLIMMERS in your fathers’ eyes! Let me out! Let me out! Giuro che quando usciro da questa gabbia il mio unico pensiero sarà spiccarvi dal tronco quelle teste di cazzo e ficcarvele su per il CULO! (I swear, once I’m free of this cage I’m going to make it my mission to sever your dickheads and shove them up your ASS!)

[Ezio opens his cage.]

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: About goddamned time! I don’t know if I should kiss you or slap you. Maybe both. Just to be safe!

Ezio Auditore: That’s quite alright.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Who are you?

Ezio Auditore: I am Ezio Auditore da Firenze, I’m here to rescue you.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Hah! Let’s see who winds up rescuing who?

Ezio Auditore: What do you mean?

Solder: Down there! Stop them!

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Hmm... What... Oh, sorry. I’d fallen asleep!

[Bartolomeo defeats the guards with a broomstick.]

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Where to, Madonna?

Ezio Auditore: We should go.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Agreed. There are still more heads to be smashed!

Ezio Auditore: Perhaps we should try and avoid conflict?

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Why?! Are you afraid?

Ezio Auditore: No. Just practical, given that they outnumber us 100 to 1.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: As you wish, bella mia (my lady)! Watch for the large one. Dante, he’s called. Most of Silvio’s men are useless - but that one’s trouble. Ah! Sweet freedom! How I have missed you!

Ezio Auditore: Silvio’s set his men to ransacking your place. Prepare yourself for a fight.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: No need! Bartolomeo is ALWAYS prepared for a fight! Are we there yet? Must. Break. Bones.

[As he approaches Antonio’s secret hiding place, Ezio notices several soldiers coming out of it.]

Soldier: If you value your life, you’ll stand down!

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Never! What good is a man’s life if it’s not lived free, eh? I’ll not go back into a cage!

Soldier: Then you’ll go into the ground! Kill them!

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: What a mess they’ve made! Bianca... I hope she’s unharmed…

[“Caged Fighter” synchronized.]
Leave No Man Behind
Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Bianca! Bianca!

Ezio Auditore: Is everything alright?

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: What do you think? Look at this place! And poor Bianca! If something’s happened to her… Ah-ha!

[He picks up a massive sword from the floor.]

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Oh, my darling! Thank God you’re alright! Ezio, meet Bianca. Bianca, Ezio.

Ezio Auditore: Charmed.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: So - I know your name, but not why you’re here.

Ezio Auditore: I have... business with Silvio Barbarigo. I was told you could help.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Ah! It would be my honor!

Ezio Auditore: But it’s going to require more than just the two - er, three of us to weaken his forces. How do you suggest we proceed?

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: I’ll go and ready my men for battle. While I do this, I’d like you to rescue those who were captured during Silvio’s assault. I cannot, in good conscience, leave them behind.

Ezio Auditore: Intesi. (Understood). I will attend to it at once.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Good luck out there, Ezio!



Mercenary: Many thanks for the aid, friend! We’d like to fight with you - if you’ll have us? We are with you friend! Only lead the way!

[Hiring some mercenaries Ezio crushes the guards and rescues Bartolomeo’s men.]

Bartolomeo’s Man: Let us join you. Together we will crush the Barbarigo!

[“Leave No Man Behind” synchronized. Ezio returns to Bartolomeo.]

Assume The Position
Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Salute Ezio! Welcome back! And well done! My host is restored to its former glory! Now Silvio will see just how grave a mistake he’s made.

Ezio Auditore: How should we proceed? A direct assault against the Arsenale?

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: No. We’d be massacred at the gates. I have something else in mind. Take my men and plant them throughout the district. The trouble they cause will force Silivio to dispatch most of his guards.

Ezio Auditore: And with the Arsenale drained of mercenaries, I can move in for the kill.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Esatto! (Exactly!) You’ll be virtually unopposed.

Ezio Auditore: Let’s hope he takes the bait.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Oh, don’t worry. He will.

[With the help of Bartolomeo’s men Ezio kills for marked targets.]

Ezio Auditore: Wait here for my signal.

Bartolomeo’s Man: As you wish.

[Ezio frees another group of Bartolomeo’s Men.]

Ezio Auditore: Hold your ground here.

Bartolomeo’s Man: Consider it done!

[Ezio frees the last group of Bartolomeo’s Men.]

Ezio Auditore: Here. This is where you’ll wait.

Bartolomeo’s Man: Send word when it’s time to strike.

[“Assume The Position” synchronized. Ezio returns to Bartolomeo.]

Two Birds, One Blade
Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Ah! There you are. Is it done?

Ezio Auditore: Yes. All your men are in place.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Bene, bene. (Good, good). Take this. (gives Ezio a firework) I assume you know how it works? Find the highest point you can in the district and fire it from there. This signals my men to begin the attack.

Ezio Auditore: Alright then. I’ll see you on the battlefield.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: That you will!

[Ezio climbs the cross of the tallest tower and sparks fireworks. Fighting breaks out all over the city. Bartolomeo battles Dante, who is holding a huge axe.]

Ezio Auditore: Bartolomeo needs my help!

[He jumps off the cross into the water]

Dante Moro: (fleeing) Must return to l’Arsenale...

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Salute Ezio!

Ezio Auditore: Care for some company?

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: By all means!

[He starts chasing Dante.]

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: After him!

Silvio Barbarigo: A fine specimen, isn’t he? You should be honored to die by his hand!

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Ciucciami i coglioni, muso da mona! (Suck my balls, you fucking idiot!) Porca puttana! (Son of a bitch! Come on, Ezio! We need to stop that grassone bastardo (fat bastard)!

[As Ezio fights Dante, Silvio taunts him from a safe location.]

Silvio Barbarigo: You think I don’t know why you’re here Ezio? But you’re too late! There’s nothing you can do to prevent us from obtaining it… Ah! That’s right - you still don’t know, do you? Though once Dante’s done with you, it won’t matter anymore. Do you miss him, Ezio? Your fool of a father? My greatest regret is could not have been the one to pull the lever. To watch him kick and gasp and HANG! You’ll follow him into the ground! You and that condottiero (mercenary captain) both! And after we’ll come for the others.

[Eventually Silvio grows bored with their fight.]

Silvio Barbarigo: Enough of this! We’re out of time. Return to me. We must depart.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Ezio! Go now! That brute will no doubt lead you straight to his master! My men and I will remain here and keep the guards from giving chase.

Silvio Barbarigo: Hurry! They’re going to leave without us!

[Ezio runs after Dante and Silvio. First he kills the fatty Silvio, who is quickly exhausted. Dante, on the other hand, offers much more resistance and is helped by soldiers, but Ezio still kills him.]

Ezio Auditore: What’s happened here? Why the boats? I thought you sought the Doge’s seat?

Silvio Barbarigo: Just a distraction. We were meant to sail...

Ezio Auditore: Sail where?

Silvio Barbarigo: I’ll never tell. (dies)

Date Moro: Cyprus is their destination. They want... They... want… (dies)

Ezio Auditore: Non temete l’oscurità - accettate il suo abbraccio. (Fear not the darkness - but welcome its embrace). Requiescant in Pace. (Rest in peace.)

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Well done, Ezio! Silvio is defeated and the military district returned to us! Perhaps now Venezia might finally enjoy a bit of pace e tranquillità (peace and quiet)! We should celebrate this victory!

Ezio Auditore: I am glad for you and your men, Bartolomeo. But I cannot join. I fear my work has just taken a rather strange turn....

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: What do you mean?

Ezio Auditore: Silvio wasn’t looking to replace Marco as Doge. He was about to leave Venezia, in fact. This whole thing was just a distraction.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Why?

Ezio Auditore: That is what I need to find out.

[Ezio sits on a bench and thinks.]

Rosa: There you are, Ezio! Why so serious?

Ezio Auditore: It’s my birthday.

Rosa: Davvero? (Really?) Cento di questi giorni! (Happy birthday!) That’s wonderful!

Ezio Auditore: Is it? ...It’s been over ten years, since I watched my father and brothers die... Ten years hunting the men responsible. I’m so close to the end now but... no closer to understanding what any of it was for.

Rosa: You may not see it, Ezio, but it’s better here now because of the things you’ve done... Basta… (Enough...) Look, here. I have a "birthday" present for you… It’s L’Arsenale’s Shipping Manifest -- from the day the boat left.

Ezio Auditore: The boat to Cyprus? You’re serious-- ?

Rosa: And guess when it’s scheduled to return? ... Tomorrow.

Leonardo da Vinci: Ezio-- !

Ezio Auditore: Leonardo!? When did you get back?

Leonardo da Vinci: Just now! I need to talk to you. Right away.

Rosa: Go on. Have fun boys.

Ezio Auditore: This better be good.

Leonardo da Vinci: Oh, it is, it is! Walk with me. Stay close.

[They walk down the street.]

Leonardo da Vinci: These last two codex pages... I was studying the copies... I don’t know why I never saw it before! But when put together, realized the markings on the back clarify into words... Here: "The Prophet... will appear... when the second piece is brought to the floating city..."

Ezio Auditore: Prophet...? "Only the prophet may open it..." "Two pieces of Eden..."

Leonardo da Vinci: What are you saying? -- Ezio, what is this?

Ezio Auditore: We’ve known each other a long time, Leonardo. If I can’t trust you, there is nobody. -- My Uncle Mario spoke of it, long ago. A prophecy hidden in the Codex... Leading to an ancient vault, that holds something... very powerful.

Leonardo da Vinci: Grandioso (How grand). - But... If you took these pages from the Barbarigo, then maybe they know about this vault too. -- That’s not good.

Ezio Auditore: Wait... What if that’s why they sent the ship to Cyprus? To find this Piece of Eden... and bring it back to Venezia...

Leonardo da Vinci: "When the second piece is brought to the floating city..."

Ezio Auditore: "...The Prophet will appear." -- "Only the prophet can open the vault..." My God! When my uncle told me about the Codex, I was too young, too brash, to imagine it was anything but an old man’s fantasy. But now, I see... The killing of Mocenigo, even the Medici, my father and brothers -- it was all part of his plan. To find the VAULT... The Spaniard!

Leonardo da Vinci: Rodrigo Borgia.

Ezio Auditore: The boat from Cyprus arrives tomorrow. I plan to be there to meet it.

Leonardo da Vinci: Good luck my friend.

[Ezio runs to the store and prepares for a serious battle. He buys good armor and improves his weapons. After that he goes to the port. Several soldiers arrive on the ship with something in the form of a crown in their hands. Ezio notices his uncle hiding around the corner.]

Ezio Auditore: Uncle Mario? Where are they taking it!?

[He follows the courier.]

Soldier: (to courier) The Maestro awaits. He will not suffer mistakes. -- Package it correctly. Do it now.

Ezio Auditore: The Spaniard’s HERE...!? That changes things. If I can infiltrate this group... take the place of the courier... they’ll lead me right to the figlio di puttana (son of bitch).

[“All Things Come To He Who Waits” synchronized.]

Play Along
[Ezio climbs onto a scaffold and jumps on one of the soldiers, killing him. Afterwards, he changes into his uniform and approaches the box the courier brought.]

Ezio Auditore: (clears his throat) Yessir.

Soldier: This is a moment of great importance. Stay in formation. Make this right.

[Ezio follows the soldier with the box in his hands to Rodrigo Borgil himself. There’s couple more guards with them.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Do you really have it? You were not followed?

Solder: Absolutely. Everything went perfectly. We have followed your orders exactly as specified. The mission to Cyprus was more difficult than expected. There were --

[He suddenly dies.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Ezio. It’s been some time.

[Ezio quickly kills two other soldiers.]

Ezio Auditore: Rodrigo. So, where is he?

Rodrigo Borgia: Hmmmm? Who?

Ezio Auditore: Your Prophet!? Doesn’t look like anybody showed up. Rodrigo! - How many people have died for this? For What’s in this box!? And look-- There’s NOBODY here!

Rodrigo Borgia: (smiles) You claim not to be a believer. And yet, here you are... Don’t you see him? The Prophet is already here... I AM the Prophet.

[He takes off his sword.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Now give me the Apple.

Ezio Auditore: Come and take it from me.

[An epic and long awaited fight begins. The two are equal in strength and equally motivated.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Is this all you have? Where’s the rest of your people?

Ezio Auditore: What people?

Rodrigo Borgia: You really have no idea, do you? Guards!

[A few guards rushing in. Ezio fights them and suddenly…]

Ezio Auditore: Uncle!?

Mario Auditore: Don’t worry, nipote (nephew)! You are not alone.

[La Volpe stabs one of the guards.]

Ezio Auditore: Volpe! What are you doing here?

La Volpe: We could very well ask you the same thing!

Ezio Auditore: We?

[Bartolomeo and Antonio enter the fight.]

Antonio de Magianis: Save your questions, brother. Don’t let Borgia leave with that box! Avanti! (Forward!)

Rodrigo Borgia: Now, you all shall die...

Antonio de Magianis: Take him down, Ezio! We’re right behind you!

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Come at me, codardi (cowards)! All of you! My Bianca hungers for more skulls to crush!

Rodrigo Borgia: This is pathetic. You cannot stop what is written. What lies in the Vault shall be mine!

La Volpe: Look, my friends. Our Ezio has become quite a guerriero (warrior). (laughs) A cuccia, tu (Down, boy.) You mess with the Fox, you get the sword.

Mario Auditore: What FUN! We should do this more often!

Rodrigo Borgia: This is a losing battle for you, hombrecito (boy). You will die by my hand, just like your father… This war has been going on far longer than either of us have played a role.

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: Isn’t this magnifico (wonderful), Ezio!? All of us smashing these Templar heads together!

Mario Auditore: Notevole, nipote! (Impressive, nephew!) You’ve improved since the last time we fought together.

Antonio de Magianis: Ah, bravissimo! (very good!) We should do this more often!

Rodrigo Borgia: Your brothers didn’t need to die. I just killed them to make a point. There is no mercy when you cross the Templar!

[Ezio grabs Rodrigo by the scruff of the neck, punches him in the face several times and throws him to the ground, then kicks him several times. Standing up, Rodrigo kicks Ezio and runs away.]

Rodrigo Borgia: This is for my father you--

Ezio Auditore: Paola!?

Paola: He’s gone. But we have what we came for...

Ezio Auditore: No! I need to go after him--

Sister Teodora: Do you really, now? Or are you here for another reason, my son?

Ezio Auditore: Teodora--? What--!? What are you all DOING HERE!?

Man: Perhaps the same thing you are, Ezio. Hoping to see the Prophet appear.

Ezio Auditore: I came here to kill the Spaniard. I couldn’t care less about your prophet. -- He never showed up!

Man: No...? But, you did.

Ezio Auditore: --What?

Man: A prophet’s arrival was foretold... And, unbeknownst to us - here you are. Perhaps all along, you were the one we sought.

Ezio Auditore: Cosa? (What?) Who are you?

Man: Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli. I am an Assassin - trained in the ancient ways to safeguard mankind’s evolution. Just like you, and each one of us here.

Ezio Auditore: You are all Assassins? Paola...? Volpe...?

Mario Auditore: It’s true, nipote (nephew). We have all been guiding you for years, teaching you the skills you would need to join our ranks... I think it’s time…

Antonio de Magianis: We have our prize, but there is much to be done. Come meet us here at sunset.

[They all meet at a top of a tower. There’s a fire in the center and the other assassin’s gather around it.]

Mario Auditore: Laa shay’a waqi’un moutlaq bale kouloun moumkine. These are the words spoken by our ancestors—that lay at the heart of our creed.

Niccolò Machiavelli: Where other men blindly follow the truth, remember...

Ezio Auditore: ...Nothing is true.

Niccolò Machiavelli: Where other men are limited, by morality or law, remember...

Ezio Auditore: ...Everything is permitted.

Niccolò Machiavelli: We work in the dark, to serve the light. We are Assassins.

Everyone: Nothing is true, everything is permitted.

Mario Auditore: It is time Ezio… In this modern age, we are not so literal as our ancestors. But our seal is no less permanent. -- Are you ready to join us?

Ezio Auditore: I am.

Antonio de Magianis: This only hurts for a while, brother. Like so many things.

[He pulls a red-hot branding from the fire and branding Ezio’s right hand.]

Niccolò Machiavelli: Benvenuto (Welcome), Ezio. You are one of us now. Come! We have much to do!

[Other assassins leave the banshee using the leap of faith. Ezio does the same. “Play Along” synchronized. Now Ezio has the Apple of Eden! Memory Sequence 11 completed! Suddenly Desmond comes to his senses.]

Lucy Stillman: Are you okay? Do you want to stop?

Desmond Miles: No. I need to go back. Right now.

[They start the machine again but something goes wrong.]

Shaun Hastings: O-oh... oh dear.

Lucy Stillman: Shaun?

Shaun Hastings: Of course. How could I have forgotten...

Desmond Miles: You wanna share with the rest of us?

Shaun Hastings: Rodrigo Borgia is elected Pope in 1492. Which means Ezio’s greatest enemy is now also the most powerful man in Italy.

Desmond Miles: Always wanted to visit the Vatican.

Shaun Hastings: Well your luck’s in Desmond, happy days. Cause that’s exactly where your going.

[Desmond returns to Ezio’s body.]

Memory Sequence 12: Battle of Forli
Leonardo da Vinci: (studying the Apple) Fascinating... Absolutely fascinating...

Ezio Auditore: What is it, Leonardo? What does it do?

Leonardo da Vinci: I could no more explain this than explain to you why the Earth goes around the sun!

Mario Auditore: You mean the Sun around the Earth?

Leonardo da Vinci: It’s fabricated with materials that shouldn’t exist... And YET... this is clearly a very ancient artifact.

Mario Auditore: The Codex refers to it as "A Piece of Eden."

Ezio Auditore: The Spaniard... He called it "The Apple."

Leonardo da Vinci: Like Eve’s Apple? Of Forbidden Knowledge? Are you then suggesting that this thing…

[Ezio touches the apple. Streams of light and sound burst out of it. Various knowledge and formulas are written right in the air.]

Leonardo da Vinci: This must never fall into the wrong hands. It would drive weaker minds insane...

Ezio Auditore: No doubt, the Spaniard will be relentless in his desire to gain it back.

Niccolò Machiavelli: Ezio, you must protect this with all the skills we have taught you.

Mario Auditore: Take it to Forli. The citadel is walled, protected by cannons -- and our ally controls it.

Mario Auditore: Ezio Auditore: Who is this ally?

Mario Auditore: Her name is Caterina Sforza.

Ezio Auditore: You don’t say... I think I may enjoy this mission. Thank you for everything, my oldest friend. (hugs Leonardo)

Mario Auditore: Leonardo! Ezio tells me you travel often to Milano. I have a grand villa in Toscana. You must come visit me there.
A Warm Welcome
ROMAGNA
1488

Caterina Sforza: Well, well, look who it is.

Ezio Auditore: Madonna.

Caterina Sforza: I thought when we met you were a bit special. But, an Assassin, hmmm?

[Ezio follows Caterina.]

Caterina Sforza: Walk with me, caro (darling.) You’re going to love Forli! The cannons in our cittadella alone go back a hundred years. The artifact will be quite safe there.

Ezio Auditore: Forgive me, but I’ve never heard of a woman ruling her own city before. It’s very impressive.

Caterina Sforza: Well... It was my husband’s before, of course. He died.

Ezio Auditore: Oh, I’m sorry.

Caterina Sforza: Don’t be. I had him killed.

[Ezio clears his throat.]

Niccolò Machiavelli: We discovered Girolamo Riario was working for the Templars. Making a map of the locations of the remaining Codex pages.

Caterina Sforza: I never liked the goddamned son of a bitch anyway. He was a lousy father, boring in bed, and a pain in my ass.--

Ezio Auditore: Look --

Caterina Sforza: Oh no…

[A lot of people run out of a small town in the distance.]

Caterina Sforza: Aspetta! (Wait) What’s happening?

Girl: They came as soon as you left the city walls, Signora. The city is under attack.

Caterina Sforza: What!? By who--!?

Girl: The Orsi brothers, Signora.

Caterina Sforza: Aw, sangue di Giuda! (God damn it!)

Ezio Auditore: Who are the Orsi?

Caterina Sforza: The same canaglie (rascals) I hired to kill my husband!

Niccolò Machiavelli: It’s the Spaniard, of course. The Orsi have no world view bigger than their purse.

Ezio Auditore: But how could he know where we were taking the Apple - before we even knew!?

Niccolò Machiavelli: Because they’re not here for the Apple, Ezio. They’re after Riario’s map.

Caterina Sforza: Basta (Stop) with your map, Niccolo! My children are inside! Oh, porco demonio! (Oh, fucking hell!)

[Ezio runs to the gates of Forli.]

Caterina Sforza: They’re already inside! Double-crossing bastards...

Ezio Auditore: Is there another way into this place?

Caterina Sforza: Aspetta... Perhaps, yes. There’s an old tunnel under the western wall from the canal.

Ezio Auditore: Bene (Got it) - I’ll be right back.

[He takes a boat and Caterina distracts the guards.]

Caterina Sforza: Hey! You! Yeah, I’m talking to you, you spineless dogs! You occupy MY city!? My home!? You think I’m going to stand here and do nothing about it? How about I come up there and rip your balle (balls) off? What kind of men are you? Doing the bidding of your masters for loose change! You’re not afraid of me? You will be when I come up there and cut your heads off, piss down your necks and shove your faces up my fica (cunt)! I’ll stick your balle (balls) with a fork and roast them over my kitchen fire! How’s that sound? You laugh? You wouldn’t If I was a man. You think I won’t do it, just because of THESE--!? Le lette! Le mie tette! (Tits! My tits!) I bet you want to see them, don’t you? You wish you could touch them, you wish you could lick them. Don’t you? Well, come on down here and give it a try, like a real man... And I’ll kick your balls so hard they’ll fly out your nostrils! Lurido branco di cani bastardi! Tornatevene a casa, se non volete finire impalati sulle mura della mia cittadella. Ahhh! Ma, Forse è per questo che non vi decidete a uscire. Gia, scommetto che lo gradireste assai un bel paia di quercia su per il culo! (Vile pack of bastard dogs! Go back to your kennel, or I’ll have you all impaled along my citadel walls. Ahhh! But maybe is this the reason you are not leaving. Yes, I guess you’d really enjoy a long oaken pole up your asses.) Sandiddia! Ma dove vi hanno pescato? In un convento di monache? Non ho mai visto in vita mia un accozzaglia di codardi Sanguediddio! Ma dove vi hanno pescato? In un convento di monache? Non ho mai visto in vita mia un’accozzaglia di codardi peggio assortita di voi. Che vista penosa! Dopo che vi avro falia castrare, non sarete meno uomini di quanto siete ora! (God almighty! Where did they find you? In a nunnery? Never in all my days have I laid eyes on such an abject, motley crew of cowards. What a pathetic sight! Even after I’ve had you castrated, you’ll not be less men then you are now!)

[While she was giving her vivid, intense speech, Ezio sneaked into the castle, killed the guards, and opened the gates.]

Caterina Sforza: Ezio! You did it! Seguimi! (Follow me!)

[“A Warm Welcome” synchronized.]

Bodyguard
[Ezio protects Niccolò and CVatarina from the chaos that rages on the streets of Rocca di Ravaldino. They approach the castle itself.]

Caterina Sforza: Aprite la porta! Aprite la porta! Presta! (Open the door! Open the door! Hurry!)

Niccolò Machiavelli: It’s an ambush!

[The heroes are again attacked by a bunch of soldiers.]

Caterina Sforza: Ezio! Niccolo! In here! Into the Cittadella! Come on! You can’t hold them off forever!

[They hide in the fort. Caterina hugs her children.]

Caterina Sforza: Bambini! ...But where are Bianca and Ottaviano!?

Servant: Forgive me. Signora. They were playing outside when the attack began... I don’t know where they are...

Soldier: Reinforcements from the mountains! They are breaching the citadel!!

Caterina Sforza: Ezio! Don’t let those bastardi (bastards) get in here!

Niccolò Machiavelli: With me!

[“Bodyguard” synchronized.]
Holding The Fort
[Ezio again has to defend Caterina and Nicollo from the attacking soldiers. Having won, he approaches Katerina, standing atop one of the towers. At the bottom, two men approach the castle.]

Man 1: Caterina! Caterina Sforza! I know you’re in there! I have something you may want back! Are you missing any children? And Ezio Auditore... What a pleasant surprise.

Ezio Auditore: I take it you would be the Orsi brothers.

Man 2: Ludovico --

Man 1: --And Checco. At your service.

Caterina Sforza: Basta! (Enough!) Where are my children! Let them go!

Ludovico Orsi: Of course, Signora. We’ll happily give them back yours. A certain map?

Checco Orsi: And a certain Apple, brother.

Ludovico Orsi: Si, a certain Apple indeed. Or shall I slice your babies’ necks ear to ear!?

Caterina Sforza: Bastardi! You think you can threaten mel? I’ll give you NOTHING! You want my children? Take them! I have the instrument to make more! (flashes her underwear)

Checco Orsi: When you change your mind, they’ll be in the village outside the city. - You have one hour.

[The Orsi Brother leaves. Сaterina is hysterical]

Ezio Auditore: Caterina, no... I can’t ask you to sacrifice your children.

Caterina Sforza: Nobody’s sacrificing anything. -- Go get them back for me, Ezio.

Ezio Auditore: Si. (Yes.) You have my word. The Apple needs to remain in the Citadel. Keep this safe.

[“Holding The Fort” synchronized.]

Godfather
[Now Ezio has very little time to find Caterina’s children. Fortunately they’re not so different from their mother and easily detected by the ruckus they create…]

Girl: Is this all the men you have to hold me? Stolti (Fools.) It won’t be enough. My mamma is fierce. We Sforza women are no wilting flowers. We may look pretty to the eye, but the eyes deceive. Just ask babbo (father). I hope you don’t really imagine I’m scared of you. You’d be very mistaken. My mamma would never let you hurt me. And if you touch one hair on my little brother’s head, she will hunt you down and eat you for breakfast. Capito?

[While Bianca distracts the guards with her brilliant speech, Ezio kills all the guards.]

Bianca: Grazie! Grazie, Messere! But my brother! They’re holding Ottaviano at the lighthouse.

Ludovico Orsi: You want to see your boy walk again, Caterina? Give us what we want, or I’ll throw him off the edge!

Ottaviano: Mamma! Help me! I don’t want to be here anymore.

Ludovico Orsi: Zitto, marmocchio. (Shut up, kid.) Let’s go, Caterina! Show yourself. The Apple and the map, or your kid’s a cripple.

Ottaviano: I have to pee. Please, Messere. I need to go to the bathroom. Just let me go pee.

Ludovico Orsi: Oh, per Dio, chiudi il becco. (For God sake, kid, shut the hell up.)

Ottaviano: (cries)

Ludovico Orsi: Stop acting like a baby. Where are your balls?

Ottaviano: I’m hungry. Can I have something to eat. Please, Messere, I’m hungry.

Ludovico Orsi: Basta, basta. (Enough, enough.) You’re giving me a headache. This is your last chance, Caterina! The Apple, now! Or I break the boy’s legs! You want to see your boy walk again, Caterina? Give us what we want or I’ll throw him off the edge!

[While Ottaviano drove Ludovico away, Ezio killed all the guards, climbed into the lighthouse, and, jumping out like a bullet, kills Ludovico with his blade.]

Ludovico Orsi: Caterina was a fool to send you.

Ezio Auditore: Or are you the fool, dying for a handful of change? Was it worth it?

Ludovico Orsi: More than you know... The Maestro gains his prize, because of me.

Ezio Auditore: Muori col tuo orgoglio, per quanto vale... (Die with your pride, for all it’s worth...) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[Ezio unties Ottaviano.]

Ottaviano: Grazie, Signore!

[“Godfather” synchronized.]

Checcomate
[Ezio returns the children to their mother.]

Ezio Auditore: What are you doing out here!?

Caterina Sforza: I’m so sorry, Ezio. I’m so sorry.

Ezio Auditore: What happened?

Caterina Sforza: It was a trick. To lower our defenses.

Niccolò Machiavelli: As soon as you left, they attacked again. Checco Orsi - he has the Apple!

Ezio Auditore: WHAT!? No! Where is he!?

Niccolò Machiavelli: We chased him out here. But the bastard’s escaped into the mountains—

Ezio Auditore: I’m going!

[Ezio is as fast as the wind running after Checco. Many soldiers try to stop him, but they don’t stand a chance against the agile and fast assassin. In a great leap he catches up with Checco and kills him.]

Checco Orsi: So... You have your prize again.

Ezio Auditore: Was it worth it? So much bloodshed?

Checco Orsi: (coughs blood) A prize of such value, it will not remain yours for long.

Ezio Auditore: We shall see.
[She pieces Checco’s throat with his hidden blade.]

Ezio Auditore: Che miserie nascono dall’avidità. (What wretched things are borne of greed.) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[But, in the last of his strength, Checco stabs Ezio with a dagger. Ezio falls to the ground. The apple rolls out of his hands. Someone in a black robe without a pinky finger on his right hand picks it up.]

Ezio Auditore: Wait... Don’t... Who are you? Stop... Don’t open it…

[Some time passes. Ezio recovers in a small veranda on the roof of the building. Caterina sits beside him. Ezio grows a beard.]

Caterina Sforza: Ezio! Thank God, you’re back with us. Are you alright? What happened to you?

Ezio Auditore: I… don’t know…

Caterina Sforza: One of my guards had the luck to find you in the hills. Next to Checco Orsi’s dead body.

Ezio Auditore: Si... (Yes...) That I remember... Wait... there was a third man... He took the Apple!

Caterina Sforza: Who?

Ezio Auditore: He wore a black robe, like a monk... And I think... a missing finger? Si! (Yes!) Caterina. I have to go right away!

Caterina Sforza: Of course… Then you will need this as well.

[SHe gives him a piece of paper.]

Ezio Auditore: The map Niccolo spoke of. Your husband’s--

Caterina Sforza: EX-husband, mio caro (darling)... He swore he’d uncovered the locations of all the Codex pages. You will recover the Apple, but you’ll never find the vault without this. You know there is an Abbey in the wetlands near here, where I’ve seen monks wearing black robes. I’d start there. - Now go. Find us a stramaledetto (fucking) monk.

Ezio Auditore: I think I’m going to miss you, Caterina.

Caterina Sforza: Oh, I know you will.

[“Checcomate” synchronized.]

Far From The Tree
[The first thing Ezio decides to do is to search a nearby abbey. He notices the monk being attacked by guards and helps him.]

Ezio Auditore: Blessings on you, brother.

Brother O’Callahan: Grazie. (Thank you.) I wonder if you can help me? What do you seek?

Ezio Auditore: A monk in black robes who lacks one of his ten fingers.

Brother O’Callahan: Well... Brother Guido has only nine toes. Are you sure it wasn’t a toe?

Ezio Auditore: Quite sure.

Brother O’Callahan: And then there’s Brother Domenico, but it’s his entire left arm he’s lacking.

Ezio Auditore: Again, quite sure it was a finger.

Brother O’Callahan: Hmmm... Now wait a moment, I do recall a black robed monk with nine fingers. Yes, of course, when we had our last San Vincenzo’s feast at the abbey.

Ezio Auditore: Yes, I know the place. I’ll try there. Grazie.

Brother O’Callahan: Go in peace, brother.

Ezio Auditore: I always do.

[He rides in the direction told by the brother.]

Ezio Auditore: Excuse me, brother. I wonder if you can--

Brother: Unholy demon! Get away!

Ezio Auditore: What’s wrong!?

Brother: You’re the one who killed Brother Stefano! Brothers! The killer of monks has returned!

[Panic ensues. Ezio catches the frightened Abbot.]

Brother: Please, don’t don’t want to die!

Ezio Auditore: I only kill those who kill others, and your Brother Stefano was a killer. I’m sure you are no such thing. Now, listen to me. I’m looking for a black robed monk who’s missing a finger.

Brother: Missing a finger you say? Do you mean... like Fra’ Savonarola?

Ezio Auditore: Savonarola!? Who is this? You know him?

Brother: I did... He was one of us. For a time.

Ezio Auditore: And then?

Brother: We suggested he retire to a hermitage for a good long time.

Ezio Auditore: I’m afraid to say his retreat has come to an end. Where would he have gone?

Brother: Oh dear... Santo Spirito, in Firenze It’s where he studied. Perhaps it’s where he would return.

Ezio Auditore: I thank you. Go with God, brother.

Memory Sequence 13: Bonfire of the Vanities
Florentine Fiasco
REPUBBLICA FIORENTINA
1497

[Ezio walks quietly back to Florence. He notices several monks and overhears a conversation as well as the other residents. A heavy tension hung over the whole city. There are many guards roaming the streets and attacking anyone for no reason.]

Monk: …If Piero had only a tenth of his father’s talent, we’d still have some place to call home...

Man: ...Never should have welcomed that mad monk into the city. Look at all the misery he’s wrought...

Woman: ...Don’t understand why they’d be so willing to accept his oppression....

Man 2: ...Just threw us out! Said all we owned belonged to the Chiesa di San Marco (Church of San Marco) now...

Woman 2: Sometimes I wish the Assassino (Assassin) would return to Firenze, that we might be free of this tyranny.

[He finds Niccolo on the bridge.]

Niccolò Machiavelli: Salve (Hello) Ezio. You picked a fine time for a homecoming.

Ezio Auditore: Then it’s true? Savonarola has taken control of Firenze?

Niccolò Machiavelli: Yes. No doubt aided by that treacherous artifact.

Ezio Auditore: We should get to work and retrieve it.

Niccolò Machiavelli: That may be more complicated than you think.

Ezio Auditore: Hah! When isn’t it? Why don’t you fill me in on things.

Niccolò Machiavelli: Walk with me. It all started a few weeks ago. The man everyone once reviled was suddenly the one they worshipped.

Ezio Auditore: Ah, the Apple?

Niccolò Machiavelli: Only in part. It’s not the city he’s enthralled, but its leaders: men possessed of influence and power. They, in turn, oppress the citizens and ensure his will is done.

Ezio Auditore: The people act as if they have no say in the matter.

Niccolò Machiavelli: Rare is the man willing to oppose the status quo. And so it falls to us to help them see the truth.

Ezio Auditore: Those bodies bear the emblem of the Borgia...

Niccolò Machiavelli: Yes. The Spaniard keeps sending his soldiers into Firenze, and Firenze keeps sending them back - usually in pieces.

Ezio Auditore: Then he knows the Apple is here as well... An unfortunate complication.

[They go to Palazzo Pitti.]

Ezio Auditore: A direct assault would be dangerous.

Niccolò Machiavelli: True. But what other option is there?

Ezio Auditore: Aside from the city leaders, the people’s minds are their own, correct?

Niccolò Machiavelli: Si. (Yes.)

Ezio Auditore: And they follow Savonarola not by choice, but force and fear?

Niccolò Machiavelli: Si. (Yes.)

Ezio Auditore: Then I propose we use this to our advantage. If we can silence his lieutenants and stir up discontent, he will be distracted and I will have a chance to strike.

Ezio Auditore: Clever. I’ll speak with La Volpe and Paola. They can help to organize the uprising as you free the districts.

Ezio Auditore: Then it’s settled. I’ll take care of his abettors.

[“Florentine Fiasco” synchronized.]

Still Life
[“Ezio notices some degenerate agitating people to burn books and art.”]

Degenerate: Reject the base and material! Seek salvation in the flames! The brush! The pen! The sculpter’s clay. These are the Devil’s tools! And what wretched things they birth. So today I call upon you to cast off these abominations. And consign them to the flames. That you may be cleansed. That you may be FREE! Give them up - or my guards will do it for you! When I first became a painter. I did so as means to express my devotion to God. Here there was an opportunity to grow closer to him. For if divinity was perfection, then surely capturing it would be divine? It seemed a righteous work. A form of prayer - of worship. And if others might gaze upon my creations and see something of the Lord within - well, would they not be also brought closer to Him?

[Ezio scoops out, catches up and kills the degenerate.]

Degenerate: What have I done... What have I done…

Ezio Auditore: Your actions were not your own.

Degenerate: But they were! My own self-doubt let him hold me as he did. I am sorry.

Ezio Auditore: As am I. Non è una scelta che compio a cuor leggero. (This is not a choice I make lightly.) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[He escapes the guards. “Still Life” synchronized. 1 out of 9 Savonarola’s lieutenants are assassinated.]

Doomsday
Preacher: People of Firenze! Come! Gather round. Listen well to what I say! The end approaches! Now is the time to repent! To beg God’s forgiveness. Don’t you see?! The SIGNS are all around us: Unrest! Famine! Disease! Corruption. These are the harbingers of DARKNESS! We must stand firm in our devotion test they CONSUME US ALL! I see you doubt; that you think me mad. Ahhhh... but did the Romans not say the same of Gesu? (Jesus?) Know that I, too, once shared your uncertainty. Your fear. But that was before Savonarola came to me. He showed me the—

[Ezio assassinates the preacher.]

Ezio Auditore: Your mind... I sense it is your own.

Preacher: (laughs) Not all of us required deception to be convinced. I already believed. All I said is true!

Ezio Auditore: Nothing is true. Non è un compito facile il mio... (This is not an easy thing I do...) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[He escapes the guards. “Doomsday” synchronized. 2 out of 9 Savonarola’s lieutenants are assassinated.]

Arch Nemesis
Condottiero: Non si passa! (None shall pass!) Do you hear me? Until you’ve all submitted and given yourself over to the prophet, Savonarola - this bridge will remain closed to you! I hear you moaning and complaining. You say you have things to do. Places to go. Obligations to fulfill. Hah! You have but ONE obligation - TO SUBMIT! Why fight us? Why resist? The city is ours. Your precious Medici have abandoned you! Fled into the wastes to wallow in self pity! Savonarola wants only the best for you. A city free of vice and temptation. A people united by faith. All men are equal in the eyes of the Lord - and so they shall be in Firenze!

[Ezio assassinates him.]

Ezio Auditore: You wear a noble’s clothes. How is it Savonarola charmed you?

Condottiero: Wealth and power do not ensure contentment. I wanted even more…

Ezio Auditore: And now, instead, you have nothing. Questo non è che un atto dovuto... (This is something that must be done...) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[He escapes the guards. “Arch Nemesis” synchronized. 3 out of 9 Savonarola’s lieutenants are assassinated.]
Port Authority
Merchant: Secure those crates! We can ill afford to let their contents fall into the wrong hands. We’ll see just how tough the holdouts are when they’re forced to go without food. If they want to eat, they’ll accept Savonarola as their leader. How the Medici family can still hold any sway in this city is beyond me… To think, I once considered them my patrons. But that was before the prophet opened my eyes. Then I saw the evils of commerce and the division it creates… Savonarola will lead us into a new era. One of fraternity, equality, and justice. All that remains is for us to cast off the shackles of our troubled past - and accept the Lord as our savior and true leader. We’ll see just how tough the holdouts are when they’re forced to go without food.

[Ezio assassinates him.]

Merchant: What... What have done...

Ezio Auditore: You tried to force devotion.

Merchant: Sometimes the people must be told what to think.

Ezio Auditore: No good has ever come of that. Benché il mio cuore sia turbato, la mia mente e lucida... (Though my heart may be tormented, my head is clear...) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Hitting The Hay
Farmer: Your orders are simple - keep watch over these fields and ensure no harm comes to the bundles of fieno (hay). It may seem a mundane task, but it is critical nonetheless! Without this most basic resource, they’ll lose the means to resist. They will be forced to stand down. Already many have fallen into line. They require clothing. Food, Shelter. Warmth. And all these things are born of fieno (hay). I hear you grumbling. You think this post a waste of time. But you must understand - our very existence depends upon keeping all of this secure! You don’t believe me, do you? Let me explain… The fieno (hay feeds our horses. They, in turn, pull our carts - which transport our goods to other cities - where trade is conducted. In this way our economy is made to thrive! And then there is the livestock. Cattle and sheep require fieno (hay) for sustenance. And as you know, they provide us with all manner of things: wool, meat, and milk to name a few. Do you see, then? Why the fieno (hay) must not fall into enemy hands? So do not dismiss the work you do here. It is vital to our continued success.

[Ezio assassinates him from a stock of hay.]

Ezio Auditore: You would have let your own people starve! And for what?

Farmer: Too long I suffered their insults. They called me simple and low-class… I wanted their respect.

Ezio Auditore: I’m affraid you do not have mine. Per quanto sia penoso il trapasso, lieto sarà il tuo sonno... (Though the passing may be painful, it will be a gentle sleep...) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Upward Mobility
Nobleman: You must not disrupt our work! Firenze is sick! It’s our duty to cure her.

Ezio Auditore: How? by forcing her people to follow a madman?

Nobleman: It is unwise for you to challenge those in power.

Ezio Auditore: Yes. Well, that is about to change.

Nobleman: No! You won’t take me! Savonarola will know of your treachery! Guards! Guards!

[Ezio chases the nobleman.]

Nobleman: Savonarola is our savior! Why must you resist this? Things are better under him! Under us! The people agree, else they would not follow as they do! Savonarola warned of dissent! But I did not expect it would be violent!

[Ezio assassinates him.]

Nobleman: I was a victim! It’s not my fault!

Ezio Auditore: No. You made a choice.

Nobleman: He charmed me. With that... thing.

Ezio Auditore: Only because you allowed it. Lo faccio per il popolo...(I do this for the people...) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[He escapes the guards. “Upward Mobility” synchronized. 6 out of 9 Savonarola’s lieutenants are assassinated. Ezio continues to explore Florence.]

Ezio Auditore: Something’s wrong here. Where is everyone...?

Climbing The Ranks
Captain: Ah! Another challenger! Excellent! Savonarola warned me that some would oppose our rule. And so devised this little trap - to ferret out those foolish enough to play at hero. It’s proven to be both entertaining and effective. Incominciamo! (Let us begin!)

[Ezio is forced to fight.]

Captain: What a spectacle! I wonder just how long you’ll survive. Another - a few days back - he made it through over three dozen of my men - before he was finally put down. It’s interesting. Every day, without fail, another of you approaches. Noncomformists. Malcontents. Revolutionaries. Ribelli. (Rebels.) I’ve seen - and heard it all. Just excuses! Am I to believe you’re a champion of the downtrodden then? A hero come to free the city? A rebel leader intent on ushering in a new age? One who fights for justice? Liberty? Hmmmm? Which lie do you tell yourself? And do not be mistaken. These are lies. No matter what any of you say - you’re all here for the same reason. The same selfish reason: You seek something. Glory. Distinction. Fame. Rewards either physical, spiritual - or both! So which are you? Is it validation you desire? Or perhaps penance for some old ill? Did your father abuse you? Did other children tease you? Did a lover spurn you? If I had to guess. I would suspect a form of insecurity. Why else do you wear the hood? Why do you hide your face from the world? From yourself? I see these words are wasted, serving only to send you further into frenzy. As you wish, Fight on. You can’t hold out forever…

[Dealt with the solder on the ground Ezio climbs to the roof.]

Captain: You’re making a very big mistake! You seek to challenge me? You’ve just signed your death warrant, boy!

[Ezio assassinates the Captain through a hundred of soldiers trying to stop him.]

Captain: Is this truly who I was? So proud and cruel...

Ezio Auditore: No. Savonarola bewitched you.

Captain: Did he? Or was it that I tasted power and found myself intoxicated. I wish I had been stronger.

Ezio Auditore: As do I. Mi rincresce, ma non c’è altro modo. (I am truly sorry, but there is no other way.) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[He escapes the guards. “Climbing The Ranks” synchronized. 7 out of 9 Savonarola’s lieutenants are assassinated.]

Surgical Strike
[Ezio notices a doctor preaching to the assembled crowd.]

Doctor: It’s quite simple, amici (my friends). If you desire care, you’ll submit yourselves fully to our new ruler. The choice is yours to make. Continue to support the Medici - who - as you know - have long since fled Firenze - or accept Savonarola. Why fight it? Why refuse? He is a good man, strong of character and morals. He seeks to save us from ourselves. And saving is what we need Before Savonarola came to us, we were
mured in sin: gluttony, lust, pride, avarice... Need I go on? We cared over much for earthly things and pleasures of the flesh. We shied from the face of God. And why wouldn’t we, shamed as we were at our actions? This is why you ache and take ill. It is divine retribution. But fear not! If you wish to be healed - if you wish to be SAVED - only pledge yourself to Savonarola. Do this, and I will admit you.

[Ezio shots the doctor from the crowd.]

Doctor: You have spilled the blood of a healer.

Ezio Auditore: No. I have spilled the blood of tyrant.

Doctor: To command such power over the body, between this world and the next. It seems, I grew intoxicated.

Ezio Auditore: And now you grow still. La tua morte non sarà inutile... (Your death will serve a purpose...) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[He escapes the guards. “Surgical Strike” synchronized. 8 out of 9 Savonarola’s lieutenants are assassinated.]

Last Rites
[At the top of Il Duomo, a monk sings a prayer. Ezio tries to get close to him without attracting the attention of the other monks, so as not to cause a panic.]

Monk: Omnipotens Deus, Rex regum, et omnium gubernator, cujus potentiæ nulla creatura resistere potest, cui proprium est peccatores punire, et eorum misereri qui vere agunt poenitentiam, serva et libera nos, suppliciter te petimus, a manu inimicorum, reprime eorum superbiam, minue malitiam, dissipa illorum machinationes et astutias, ut nos tuis armis muniti semper servemur ab omnibus periculis, ad glorificandum te, qui es unicus victoriae largitor : propter merita unigeniti Filii tui Domini nostri Jesu Christi. Amen.

Rough Translation: Almighty God, King of kings and Governor of all, whose power no creature can resist, to whom it is proper to punish sinners and to have mercy on those who truly do penance, keep and deliver us break down their machinations and cunning, so that we, protected by your arms, may be saved from all dangers, in order to glorify you, you who are the only giver of victory: on account of the merits of your only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

[Ezio assassinates him.]

Monk: I thought he preached the word of God.

Ezio Auditore: I fear his sermon is a lie.

Monk: I led my flock astray... It’s just... I wanted so badly to believe...

Ezio Auditore: We all do. Vedrò compiuta l’opera di mio padre... (I will see my father’s work completed.... Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[He jumps off Il Duomo in a leap of faith. “Last Rites” synchronized. 9 out of 9 Savonarola’s lieutenants are assassinated. Without agitators fomenting unrest, the streets are a little calmer. Ezio returns to Niccolò and Paola.]
Power To The People
Paola: You’ve done well, Ezio.

Ezio Auditore: What happens now?

Niccolò Machiavelli: Watch.

[Many people gathered in front of Savonarola’s house. They are demanding retribution!]

Savonarola: Silence! I demand silence! Why are you here?! Why do you disturb me?! You should be cleansing your homes. Cleansing your SELVES! There are bonfires to feed! Prayers to be said! Penance to be done! You will do as I command! You will SUBMIT!

[He pulls an Apple out of his pocket, but Ezio throws a metatarsal knife at him. Savonarola drops the Apple. The enraged crowd grabs Savonarola.]

Savonarola: NO!

La Volpe: Find the Apple, Ezio! It can’t be far...

[One of Savonarola’s guards, instead of helping him, grabs Apple and runs away. Ezio easily catches up with him and kills him, returning the Apple of Eden. “Power To The People” synchronized.]

Mob Justice
[People gather in the square. They want Savonarola executed immediately. Burn him at the stake!]

Savonarola: God bears witness to this sacrilege! That you would handle his prophet this way! Blasphemers! Heretics! You’ll burn for this. DO YOU HEAR ME? You’ll BURN!

[Savonarola is tied up and the brushwood is set on fire. The people rejoice.]

Savonarola: O Lord, show mercy... Deliver me from evil’s embrace… Surrounded as I am by sin, I cry out to you for salvation…

Ezio Auditore: No one deserves to die in such pain.

Savonarola: Infelix ego, omnium auxilio destitutus, qui coelum terramque offendi: quo ibo? Quo me vertam? Ad quem confugiam? Quis mei miserebitur? Ad ccelum levare oculos non audeo. Quia ei graviter peccavi. In terra refugium non invenio. Quia ei scandalum fui. (How unhappy I feel there is no one can ask for help, as I have broken the laws of both earth and heaven. So which way can I turn? Who can I run to? Who will take pity on me? I dare not look up to heaven as I have sinned against it grievously. I can find no refuge on earth, as I have been a scandal to it also.)

{This poem was actually written by Savonarola in prison before his execution.}

[In one swoop, Ezio reaches Savanorola and kills him with his hidden blade.]

Savonarola: It’s you... I knew this day would come. Please... show mercy.

Ezio Auditore: I have. Va’ ora. Che sia il tuo Dio a giudicarti. (Go now - that you may be judged by your God.) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[Ezio climbs the platform and addresses the crowd.]

Ezio Auditore: Silenzio! (Silence!) People... Twenty-two years ago. I stood where I stand now - and watched my loved ones die, betrayed by those I had called friends. Vengeance clouded my mind. It would have consumed me. were it not for the wisdom of a few strangers, who taught me to look past my instincts. They never preached answers, but guided me to learn from myself. We don’t need anyone to tell us what to do. Not Savonarola, not the Medici. We are free to follow our own path. There are those who will take that freedom from us, and too many of you gladly give it. But it is our ability to choose - whatever you think is true that makes us human… There is no book or teacher to give you the answers, to show you the path. Choose your own way! Do not follow me. Or anyone else.

[He jumps off the platform and goes to his friends. Uncle Mario puts his hand on his shoulder with a smile. They’re leaving. “Mob Justice” synchronized. Memory Sequence 13 completed!]

Memory Sequence 15: Veni, Vidi, Vici
X Marks The Spot
[Ezio returns to the family estate. He, or rather Desmond, notices that some rooms have become inaccessible.]

Desmond Miles: (in Ezio’s head) What’s going on?

Rebecca Crane: (in Ezio’s head) The data stream is corrupted. No, scratch that. This says it’s incomplete. It’s the Codex pages. It looks like Ezio had them all when this memory occurred.

Desmond Miles: (in Ezio’s head) Great. And how am I supposed to find them?

Rebecca Crane: (in Ezio’s head) Hold on... It looks like Ezio has a map on him. He must have picked it up during one of the corrupted sequences. According to this, it’ll show you the location of any missing Codex pages.

[Ezio finds the remaining Codex pages and returns to the family estate.]

Mario Auditore: It seems you have yet to translate all your Codex pages, nipote (nephew). Go and see Leonardo and have him make sense of their contents. Only then can we begin...

Ezio Auditore: Leonardo!

Leonardo da Vinci: Ezio! So good to see you! How can I help you? Aha! You’ve found another one! How exciting! Uh… hmmm, up, then you just take the inverse… there!

[And now all the Codex pages have been deciphered!]

Mario Auditore: Ezio!

Ezio Auditore: It is time, uncle. Let us finish what you and my father started all those years ago...

Mario Auditore: Indeed. Perhaps now we can finally make sense of this prophecy - and put a stop to whatever it is The Spaniard is plotting.

Ezio Auditore: We should start by locating the Vault. The Codex pages will lead us to it. Let’s take a look.

[Ezio needs to assemble a map to the Vault from the deciphered pages. After a while he succeeds.]

Ezio Auditore: It... Jis a map of the entire world... But... there are lands shown here that do not exist…

Niccolò Machiavelli: Apparently they do exist. I imagine they’ve yet to be discovered. Or rediscovered...

Ezio Auditore: How is this possible?

Niccolò Machiavelli: Perhaps the Vault will hold the answer.

Paola: Do you see where it is, then?

Ezio Auditore: No! It can’t be! The vault... It looks like the vault is in Roma. Then the Spaniard... This is why he became Pope!

Mario Auditore: Now I understand! It’s not the vault alone he’s gained access to - but the staff as well!

Sister Teodora: What staff?

Mario Auditore: The Codex always spoke of two keys... two Pieces of Eden needed to open the vault. One is the Apple...

Ezio Auditore: And the other is the staff... The Papal Staff is the second piece of Eden.

Mario Auditore: For years... No, decades. We have sought these answers.

Paola: And now, at last, we have them...

Antonio de Magianis: But so too could the Spaniard... And if he does... if he finds a way into the Vault... It’s contents will make the Apple seem a trifling thing.

Ezio Auditore: I must go to Roma and find the Vault. What of the rest of you?

Bartolomeo D’Alviano: We’ll do what we do best. Cause some trouble in the city, giving you the freedom to conduct your search.

Mario Auditore: Just let me know when you are ready, nipote (nephew).

In Bocca Al Lupo (In the Jaws of the Wolf / Best of Luck)
Mario Auditore: Roma beckons, Ezio. Let me know when you are ready to depart.

ROMA
1499

[Ezio arrives at the Vatican. Climbing onto the fortress he immediately confronts the guards.]

Guard: Assassino! Assassino!

[Ezio manages to avoid the guards by jumping onto the horse below. He gallops down the wall of the fortress and knocks down the guards trying to stop him with his mace.]

Guard: Close the gates! Stop the intruder!

[Ezio has to fight desperately because the number of guards in the Vatican is many times greater than anything he has ever encountered. Eventually he gets inside and mingles with the crowd of monks. After a while, he enters the Cappella Sistina, where Rodrigo Borgia is reciting a prayer in front of a crowd of monks.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Credo in unum Deum. Patrem omnipotentem, factorem coeli et terrae, visibilium omnium, et invisibilium. Et in unum Dominum Jesum Christum, Filium Dei unigenitum. Et ex Patre Natum ante omnia saecula. Deum de Deo, lumen de lumine, Deum verum de Deo vero.

[Meanwhile, Ezio prowls the rungs and support beams. He leaps epically onto his main enemy, piercing him with his concealed blade.]

Ezio Auditore: I thought... I thought I was beyond this. But I’m not. I’ve waited too long... lost too much… Requiescat in pace (Rest in peace), you bastard.

[He prepares to deliver the final blow, but Rodrigo suddenly grabs the papal staff.]

Rodrigo Borgia: I don’t think so.

[Ezio tries a second time and is still thrown off by a wave of energy.]

Rodrigo Borgia: NO!

[Rodrigo uses the staff and collects energy from other monks. They scream in agony and fall on the floor.]

Rodrigo Borgia: How is it you resist? I see... Kind of you to bring me the Apple. Now give it here!

Ezio Auditore: Vai a farti fottere. (Go fuck yourself.)

Rodrigo Borgia: (laughs) Ahh, always the fighter. Just like your father, Well - rejoice, my child for you will see him again SOON! You WILL give it to me!

Ezio Auditore: As you wish.

[He uses the Apple to create four of his clones.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Fascinating! An impressive power, this. But if you think it’s going to save you, you’ve another thing coming!

[An epic battle begins. Rodrigo proves to be quite a skilled fighter, despite his weight and the priest’s uncomfortable clothes.]

Rodrigo Borgia: How long do you think you can keep this up? You cannot stop me! You are right to fear me! I’ll cut you down, Assassin! A clever trick! But useless! How long do you think you can keep this up?

[However, in the end his strength leaves him.]

Rodrigo Borgia: No! You will not take this from me...

Ezio Auditore: It’s finished, Rodrigo. Lay down your arms and I will make sure the end comes swiftly.

Rodrigo Borgia: Really, Ezio? And would you give up so easily were fit the other way around?

[He hits the floor with his staff and Ezio falls off his feet.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Why don’t we find out!

[Some kind of energy holds Ezio down. He reaches for the Apple of Eden, but it falls out of his hands. Rodrigo picks it up.]

Rodrigo Borgia: At last!

[He inserts the Apple into his staff.]

Rodrigo Borgia: And now to deal with you.

[He lifts Ezio up with the power of his staff and pokes him in the stomach with his dagger, then walks away. Ezio falls to the floor. A short time later he, along with the other Monases, regains consciousness. He goes in search of the secret passage where Rodrigo has gone. Finding it, Ezio descends into the dungeons of the Vatican.]

Ezio Auditore: What is this place...?

[Ezio finds Rodrigo in a large circular recess in the floor. Rodrigo is furious, pounding on the closed door with his fists. Ezio goes down to him.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Open, damn you! OPEN!

Ezio Auditore: It’s over, Rodrigo. No more tricks. No more ancient artifacts. No more weapons. Let us see what you are made of, old man.

[Ezio throws away all his weapons.]

Rodrigo Borgia: Alright then, if that’s how you want to play it.

[They start fighting on their bare fists.]

Ezio Auditore: What do you even want with the Vault, Rodrigo?

Rodrigo Borgia: Don’t you know what lies within? Or do you mean to tell me the great and powerful Assassins didn’t figure it out?

Ezio Auditore: Figure what out?

Rodrigo Borgia: God! It’s God that dwells within!

Ezio Auditore: You expect me to believe that God lives beneath il Vaticano?

Rodrigo Borgia: A more logical location than a kingdom on a cloud, don’t you think? Surrounded by singing angels and cherubim. Makes for a lovely image - but the TRUTH is far more interesting.

Ezio Auditore: Let’s say I was to believe you - what do you think he’ll do when you open that door?

Rodrigo Borgia: I don’t care. It’s not approval I’m after. Just power.

Ezio Auditore: And you think he’ll give it up?

Rodrigo Borgia: Whatever lies beyond that wall won’t be able to resist the staff and apple. They were MADE for felling Gods.

Ezio Auditore: God is meant to be all knowing. All powerful. You think a couple of ancient relics can harm him?

Rodrigo Borgia: You know nothing, boy. You take your image of the creators from an ancient book - a book, mind you, written by MEN.

Ezio Auditore: You are the Pope! And yet you dismiss the central text of your Faith?

Rodrigo Borgia: (laughs) Are you so naive? I became Pope because it gave me ACCESS. It gave me POWER. Do you think I believe a single god-damned word of that ridiculous book? It’s all lies and superstition. Just like every OTHER religious tract written over the past ten thousand years.

[Exhausting him, Ezio strangles Rodrigo.]

Rodrigo Borgia: (angrily) You can’t! You can’t! It’s My destiny. MINE! I am the prophet!

Ezio Auditore: You never were...

Rodrigo Borgia: Get it over with then.

Ezio Auditore: No. Killing you won’t bring my family back... I’m done. Nulla è reale, tutto è lecito. (Nothing is true, everything is permitted.) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

[Suddenly, rays of light burst from behind a closed door. Ezio raises the staff and a ray of light from it opens the door. “In Bocca Al Lupo” synchronized. Memory Sequence 14 completed!]

[Ezio goes inside. He walks down the corridor, the walls of which are covered with light beams. He is greeted by a woman wearing a helmet-like headdress and a toga. The woman glows with a golden glow.]

Precursor: Greetings prophet. It is good you have come. Let us see it. To give thanks. We must speak.

Ezio Auditore: Who are you?

Precursor: Many names. When I died, it was Minerva. Before that Merva and Mera. And on and on. The others, too: Juno, who was before called Uni. Jupiter, who was before called Tinia...

Ezio Auditore: (quietly) You are... gods.

Minerva: (laughs) No. Not gods. We simply came... before. Even when we walked the world, your kind struggled to understand our existence. We were more... advanced in time. Your minds were not yet ready. Still... not. Maybe never. No matter. You may not comprehend us. But you will comprehend our warning. You must.

Ezio Auditore: None of what you are saying makes sense...

Minerva: Our words are not meant for you.

Ezio Auditore: What are you talking about? There’s no one else here!

Minerva: Enough! I do not wish to speak with you but through you. You are the prophet. You’ve played your part. You anchor him, but please be silent! That we may commune. Listen: (disappears) When we were still flesh and our home still whole, your kind betrayed us. We who made you. We, who gave you life! We were strong. But you were many. And both of us craved war. So busy were we with earthly concerns, we failed to notice the heavens. And by the time we did… The world burned until naught remained but ash. It should have ended then and there. But we built you in our own image. We built you to survive. And so we did. Few were our numbers. Your kind and mine. It took sacrifice. Strength. Compassion. But we rebuilt. And as life returned to the world… We endeavored to ensure this tragedy would not be repeated. But now we are dying... And time will work against us. Truth turned into myth and legend. What we built, misunderstood. Let my words preserve the message and make a record of our loss. But let my words also bring hope. You must find the other temples. Built by those who knew to turn away from war. They worked to protect us - to save us from the fire. If you can find them... If their work can be saved... so too might this world. Be quick! For time grows short. And guard against the cross - for there are many who will stand in your way. (reappears) It is done. The message is delivered. We are gone now from this world. All of us. We can do no more. The rest is up to you, Desmond.

Ezio Auditore: What? Who is Desmond? I don’t understand... Please wait! I have so many questions!

[The screen fades to black.]

Desmond Miles: What. The. Fuck

[CREDITS. A minute later we return to the secret laboratory from the present. It looks like our heroes have been found. They are frantically gathering their things.]

Shaun Hastings: ...There’s only about ten minutes until they get...

Rebecca Crane: ...need all of my equipment…

Lucy Stillman: ...ready to go they do... DESMOND!

Desmond Miles: Yeah, yeah.

Lucy Stillman: Alright, Shaun. I need you and Rebecca to get everything in here packed up and loaded into the truck. You and I’ll deal with the Templars.

Desmond Miles: What, they’re here?

Shaun Hastings: It was only a matter of time before they discovered us. To be honest, I’m surprised it took them as long as it did.

[The group is packing up in a hurry. Lucy throws Desmond an armband with a concealed blade.]

Lucy Stillman: Let’s go.

[Desmond follows Lucy.]

Desmond Miles: So what’s the plan? We ditch this place and then what?

Lucy Stillman: There’s another safe house. It’s - We’ve got company. The truck’s just up ahead.

[They are descending the stairs when suddenly a familiar face - Dr. Warren Vidic from the first part - emerges from the corner. He is surrounded by several guards with truncheons.]

Warren Vidic: Mister Miles! This is an unexpectedly pleasant turn of events! And here I thought I’d have to waste more men on you! Kind of you to save me the trouble.

Desmond Miles: What do you want, Vidic?

Warren Vidic: For you to come home! We miss you terribly. There’s still so much work for us to do together!

Lucy Stillman: It’s not happening, Warren.

Warren Vidic: You continue to disappoint in every conceivable way. Ms. Stillman. I saved your life, once. Do you remember? And THIS is how you repay me?

Lucy Stillman: You saved me so you could keep experimenting on people - destroying their lives - and for what?

Warren Vidic: Oh this tired argument again. As I recall, you were there - at my side - every step of the way… Their blood is on YOUR hands just as much as MINE.

Lucy Stillman: You need to stop him.

Desmond Miles: I’m on it.

[He enters the battle using the knowledge he has gained from Ezio.]

Warren Vidic: Our resources are infinite while yours dwindle by the minute. What were you thinking Ms. Stillman? You can’t hide from us. Is this necessary?

[Desmond and Lucy defeat all the guards.]

Desmond Miles: Uh-oh, Doc. Looks like it’s just you and me now.

Warren Vidic: Enjoy your victory Mister Miles, temporary as it is.

[He drives away in the truck he came in.]

Rebecca Crane: Desmond! We have to go!

[The screen fades to black.]

Shaun Hastings: There you are! Come on. Help Lucy into the van. Hurry, Desmond! We need to go!

Lucy Stillman: You’ll have your turn, Desmond. Warren’s gonna get what he deserves. I promise.

Desmond Miles: So what now? Where are we headed?

Lucy Stillman: There’s a cabin up north. We should be safe there - at least for a little while. I have to analyze those tapes from your session - figure out what’s happening.

Desmond Miles: And then what?

Rebecca Crane: Here we go. I’ve got you all hooked up. Got a long drive ahead of us. Figured you might want to play around with the Animus on the way...

Desmond Miles: Alright, but I’ve got some questions first. I mean - what the hell was that in the Vault?

Lucy Stillman: What you saw proves everything I was afraid of. The Templars aren’t our biggest threat. Not by a longshot.

Desmond Miles: So... what, the sun is? What’s it going to do? Cook the Earth?

Lucy Stillman: I doubt it, but... I don’t know. There’s been some speculation that the earth’s magnetic field is weakening... A sufficiently strong flare could flip the poles and cause a geomagnetic reversal. It’s all theoretical. But if it happens - the planet could become geologically unstable. Very unstable.

Shaun Hastings: It’s meant to be the stuff of pseudo-science - but clearly something catastrophic happened to the people of the first civilization. And that woman - Minerva, was it? - she seemed to think we were due for a second round.

Desmond Miles: So either way we’re fucked.

Lucy Stillman: I don’t know yet... We’ll keep reviewing the tapes. And you can keep digging through your memories. Maybe there’s more to discover.

Desmond Miles: Alright. Guess I better get started…

THE END
