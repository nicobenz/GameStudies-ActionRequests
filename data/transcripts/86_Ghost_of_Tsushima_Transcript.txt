Prologue - BATTLE FOR TSUSHIMA
[Several samurai in full armor enter the battle formation. Offscreen we hear a man's voice.]

Samurai: The Mongol Empire is invading our home. They are brutal. 

[The warriors bow to the arrived samurai.]

Samurai: Relentless. Unstoppable. We are eighty samurai against an army. Fighting to slow the invasion. Today… I die for my people.

[The offscreen narrator turns out to be one of the samurai who arrived, and the samurai themselves turn out to be the military leaders of the Japanese army. The army prepares for battle.]

Samurai: There must be thousands of them. 

Lord Shimura: We will face death and defend our home. Tradition. Courage. Honor. They are what make us. We are the warriors of Tsushima! We are samurai!

[The warriors respond with cheering.]

Lord Shimura: Lord Adachi. Go break their spirits. 

[The samurai, on horseback, set off toward the countless army of Mongols.]

Lord Adachi: Outsiders! Send your finest warrior to face me. 

[A large man dressed in richly ornamented armor emerges from the line of Mongols. He appears to be the leader.]

Lord Adachi: I am Harunobu Adachi. Descendant of the legendary Yoshinobu Adachi. 

[The large man douses Lord Adachi from his cup without a word, and then sets him on fire with a torch. After the burning samurai is tormented for some time, the large Mongol kills him with a single blow of his glaive.]

Mongol Leader: Samurai! Do you surrender? 

Lord Shimura: Cowards without honor deserve no mercy. No mercy! Open fire! For Tsushima! Charge! 

[The samurai and their army run forward to the hordes of Mongol. Dodging a hail of incendiary charges, our samurai rushes fearlessly into battle. He cuts down the Mongols with his katana at a gallop.]

Samurai: For Lord Adachi! 

Lord Shimura: Forward! We must take their leader's head! Their leader retreated! Hunt him down!

[One of the shells eventually hits its target and our samurai falls off his horse. A Mongol runs up to him and draws his sword, and suddenly Lord Shimura runs up and kills him.]

Lord Shimura: Jin! I need you with me. 

Jin: We've lost so many…. 

Lord Shimura: We have to keep pushing, Lord Sakai. Even if it costs us our lives. 

Jin: As you command, Lord Shimura. 

Lord Shimura: Men! We must hunt down the Mongol leader! Everyone, with me! More Mongol dogs! Cut them down!

[Jin mercilessly chops down the advancing squad of Mongols. The samurai advance along the beach.]

Lord Shimura: Mongol reinforcements!

[After defeating the Mongols, only Lord Shimura and Jin remain alive.]

Jin: We're all that's left. 

Lord Shimura: There is only one path for us. Find the Mongol leader and end him here.

Jin: I'll fight beside you to the end.

Lord Shimura: I know. There! The Mongol leader. 

Jin: I'm ready, Uncle. 

Lord Shimura: We end this together. (Rallying cry.)

[They rush into the attack. The genie is hit by one random projectile and thrown back. When he comes to his senses the fight is over…]

Jin: Uncle…

[Jin reaches for his sword, but he clearly has a concussion. He can barely move. His movement coordination is impaired. After taking a few steps, he loses consciousness.]

Mongol Leader: I am Khotun. Cousin of Kublai. Grandson of Genghis.

[He puts his hand on the shoulder of the bound and kneeling Shimura.]

Khotun Khan: Brother… you are a warrior. I can see that. You trained your whole life for this. And you have won battles… that lesser men have called unwinnable, yes?

[He lifts his katana off the ground.]

Khotun Khan: But while you were sharpening your sword… do you know how I prepared for today? I learned. I know your language. Your traditions. Your beliefs. Which villages to tame and… which to burn. So I will ask you once again, samurai. Do you surrender?

[Shimura responds with silence. Khotun strikes him with a heavy blow from his own katana, after which the video abruptly cuts off. Meanwhile, Jin slowly regains consciousness. Two arrows stick out of his back and he looks dead. But he turns out to be alive. With a little twitch of his fingers he clenches his hand into a fist. Some time later, Jin wakes up on a cot by the fire. In the distance, some village is burning.]

Jin: How did I get here…?

[He looks around.]

Jin: (sees the bloody bandages) Someone worked hard to keep me alive. (sees a lot of food in bags) No weapons, just supplies… Need to keep moving… Mongols. Someone saved me… hid me back here. Maybe they have my sword…

[In search of his katana, he sneaks into a nearby village overrun by Mongols. He enters a large house and looks around.]

Jin: Someone was sharpening their blade. A warrior. My armor… Broken… but better than nothing.

[Finding blood-stained armor in his and putting it on, Jin is about to leave the house. He sees the villagers being killed by Mongols. Suddenly a woman in a red kimono approaches him.]

Woman: Back inside, now! How are your wounds? Can you run? 

Jin: I… I think so. Where's my sword?

Woman: Not here. (Garch ir!) I'll take care of this. Please… hide. 

[Jin hides, and meanwhile a Mongolian enters the house. The woman pretends to be frightened and begins to cry.]

Woman: Don't hurt me. Nooo! 

Mongol: Chi odoo miniih! Rice! 

Woman: I have some rice. Please take it. 

[While the Mongol is rummaging through the woman's things, she comes up behind him and kills him with a short dagger.]

Jin: Who are you? 

Woman: I'm Yuna. You want your sword? Follow me. 

[They slowly make their way through the captured village.]

Jin: How long was I out? 

Yuna: Long enough for the Mongols to conquer half the island.

Jin: Yuna—

Yuna: Shh! Not now. Get down. (Sigh of relief.) 

Jin: Let's move.

Yuna: This way. Wait. (Angry intake of breath.) There's nothing we can do for her. 

Jin: But I can save the others. Lord Shimura was with me on the battlefield…

Yuna: The Jito? Forget him. 

Jin: Yuna, wait. Lord Shimura is my uncle. 

Yuna: You're Jin Sakai. The Jito's nephew? 

Jin: I have to know… Did he survive? 

Yuna: I think so. The Mongols took him prisoner.

Jin: Where did they take him?

Yuna: East. Along the coast. 

Jin: Toward Castle Kaneda… They must be holding him inside. Celebrating their victory. I could take them by surprise…

Yuna: You'll be killed.

Jin: Or I'll rescue Lord Shimura. Then help him drive the Mongols into the sea. He can contact the shogun, call for reinforcements… 

Yuna: I didn't nurse you back to health to watch you throw your life away.

Jin: Why did you save me?

Yuna: I couldn't leave you to die. I need your help. 

Jin: Lord Shimura can help our whole island… And he's the only family I have left. 

Mongol: Chimeegui! 

Jin: Let's move. 

Yuna: Under here. (Muffled gasp.) 

Jin: Butchers. 

Yuna: Come on. We can't help him now… Look out! 

Jin: Raiders. Armed for battle. 

Yuna: They've been riding across the island. Taking slaves, killing the weak. Through here. 

Jin: Move.

Yuna: Shit… They cleared the road. If we cross, someone's bound to see us. 

Jin: I'll take that chance. 

Yuna: Wait. The cart… Now! Come on! 

Jin: More guards. 

Yuna: We'll take the rooftops…  Up here. 

Jin: You climb roofs, scavenge battlefields… You're a thief. 

Yuna: When I need something, I take it. 

Jin: Like my katana? 

Yuna: I traded it for food and medicine.

Jin: You what?

Yuna: Don't worry. We'll find the buyer… get your sword back. We've got a long ride ahead. Take whatever supplies you can carry. 

Jin: This is someone's house. 

Yuna: And they're not coming back. Through here. The man I traded your sword to lives just up ahead… Toru? Shit. Bastards found him. 

Jin: Stand watch. I'll search the house. They will answer for this. It must be here…

[He finds his katana. Touching it and removing it from its sheath, he recalls events from his past.]

Young Jin: I am Jin Sakai. Nephew to the great Lord Shimura. And I am no coward!

[He waves his katana through the air several times in the field.]

Lord Shimura: Your enemy is no match for you. But… you still lack control. 

Young Jin: I was practicing.

Lord Shimura: With your father's weapon? The sword of clan Sakai… has saved lives… and ended wars.

[He looks at Jin's face, which shows a large abrasion.]

Lord Shimura: Who did this to you? 

Young Jin: No one. 

Lord Shimura: I will teach you to defend yourself.

Young Jin: (holding tears) I know how to fight.

Lord Shimura: To master your blade… you must first control your emotions.

Young Jin: I can do that, Uncle. 

Lord Shimura: Show me. Let's see what you've been practicing.

[They begin a training battle with wooden swords.]

Lord Shimura: Try to strike me. 

Young Jin: Yes, Uncle.

Lord Shimura: Attack. I am ready. Well done. If you'd fought like that, your attacker would not have bruised you so easily. 

Young Jin: It wasn't a fair fight. 

Lord Shimura: Imagine he's returned to finish what he started… and he'll use every dirty trick he knows. How will you defend yourself?

Young Jin: I'll kick dirt in his eyes… then break his nose. See how big he feels with a mouthful of blood.

Lord Shimura: A small victory, achieved without honor. When a samurai faces a devious foe… he must rise above them-and never sink to their level. No matter how tempting, 

Young Jin: Yes, Uncle. 

Lord Shimura: Now break through my defenses. Show me Jin Sakai is a warrior of great courage. A heavy attack will unbalance your foe. Follow with a quick strike. Hold your blocking form. A fine block. Good form. 

Young Jin: I'm sore. Can we take a break? 

Lord Shimura: We're not finished yet… Find your resolve and fight through the pain. Good. It's time you learn to parry. Wait for me to make the first move. Once I strike… block my attack. You must parry before I strike. A fine parry. Don't block too early. When I strike, parry. Good form, Jin… You're improving. 

Young Jin: Need to catch your breath? 

Lord Shimura: (Chuckles.) It will take more than a child to knock the wind out of me. Now then… let's see you defend against a spear… Dodge my spear, then follow up with a counterattack. Good reflexes. When I thrust, you dodge. Excellent counter. Excellent dodge. Remember. Dodge, then counterattack. You have a small opportunity to strike. Use it. You see? There is no weapon—no warrior—you cannot overcome. 

Young Jin: Thank you for these lessons, Uncle. 

Lord Shimura: We are not finished yet. Jin Sakai… will you honor me with a sparring match?

Young Jin: I wouldn't want to hurt you. 

Lord Shimura: If you're that confident… let's make this interesting… The first to land five strikes gets to choose dinner. 

Young Jin: I hope you like octopus.

[Shimura laughs. The battle begins!]

Young Jin: (takes a few blows) Well struck, Uncle!

Lord Shimura: Very good, Jin! You show great skill. Before we eat… I have one last question. For generations our families have lived by a code. Tell me the virtues that guide us. 

Young Jin: Loyalty to our lord. Control over our emotions. And…

Lord Shimura: You know this. 

Young Jin: Honor. To fight bravely and uphold the legacy of clan Sakai.

Lord Shimura: Those are your father's words. What does honor mean to you? 

Young Jin: I guess… protecting people. The ones who can't fight for themselves.

Lord Shimura: You have a good heart. But first… we must show everyone that we serve our lord with courage. Integrity. And self control.

Young Jin: You say that like it's easy. 

Lord Shimura: It's never easy, Jin. I struggle with it every day. But we must set an example for our people. By remaining true to our code. And to ourselves. That is the meaning of honor.

[Jin comes to his senses. A Mongol approaches him from behind. Jin slowly draws his katana from its sheath. He kills the Mongol with a few swift blows.]

Yuna: Good. You found your sword. 

Jin: Where can I find a horse? 

Yuna: The stables aren't far. This way…

Jin: More riders. 

Yuna: The island's crawling with them. 

Jin: Where are the stables? 

Yuna: Behind that burning farmhouse. Follow me. We can get close. Slit their throats, and kill them without a sound. 

Jin: Without honor. I will not break my code.

[He comes out of hiding and speaks loudly.]

Jin: Face me, invader!

[He kills three Mongols who stand in his way.]

Kiheiji: (Screaming in distress.) 

Jin: That's close…

Yuna: We can't save everyone.

Jin: I'm done running. And I can finally help.

Yuna: Dammit. (Sighs.) More guards. Don't let anyone escape. 

[Jin kills the Mongols and rescues a man with a baby in his arms.]

Kiheiji: Thank you, my lord. They said all the samurai were dead.

Jin: Do you have somewhere to hide? 

Kiheiji: I heard Golden Temple might be safe. 

Jin: Go. Stay off the roads—and guard your son with your life. 

[Kiheiji runs away.]

Yuna: You risked your life for them. 

Jin: They couldn't defend themselves, and I… I can't let more of our people die.

Yuna: They're not the only ones who need you… My brother… The Mongols took him. 

Jin: That's why you saved me. 

Yuna: Taka is my only family. 

Jin: And Lord Shimura is mine. 

Yuna: Please. I just want my brother back.

Jin: I'll help you find him… after I save my uncle. I promise.

Yuna: I'm coming with you. Stables are just up ahead. Let's get to the horses. 

Jin: They're samurai horses. The few we didn't take into battle…

Yuna: Lucky for them… and us. Which horse do you want? 

[Jin chooses the white horse.]

Jin: Easy there. 

Yuna: He suits you.

Jin: And he needs a name… Sora. Light from the heavens. 

[They ride to Castle Kaneda.]

Jin: Castle Kaneda.

Yuna: They're holding your uncle inside. The walls are too high to climb. We could cause a distraction. Sneak in. 

Jin: No. We walk in the front gate. Khotun Khan set fire to our best swordsman. Humiliated my uncle. Butchered the warriors of Tsushima… I'm going to repay his kindness. 

Yuna: By repeating the same mistakes that got your friends killed.

Jin: That's what the Mongols will think. But this time, I'll strike first. Wait here until I finish them. 

[He comes to the gate.]

Jin: I've come for Lord Shimura.

[He kills all the guards at the gate.]

Yuna: You did it.

Jin: Don't sound surprised. 

Yuna: What's all that noise? 

Jin: Not sure. The Mongols fired them off at the beach. 

Yuna: What the! Look out!

[They begin to be bombarded with the same projectiles that were used in the battle.]

Jin: Keep moving! We can't retreat!

Yuna: We can't keep going! 

Jin: I have to. Fall back—

Yuna: Alone?

Jin: Keep the path clear. When I find Lord Shimura, we'll need a quick escape.

Yuna: I'll get the horses ready 

Jin: Do it. If I'm not back soon… ride for the forest. 

[Yuna leaves, and Jin walks toward the castle, killing the Mongols.]

Jin: Khotun Khan! I am Jin Sakai. Nephew of Lord Shimura. I have come to avenge his honor.

[The leader of the Mongols comes out of the castle and leads the bound Shimura out with him.]

Khotun Khan: Your uncle has told me much about you, Jin Sakai. I will show him his nephew, broken, and humiliated, begging… to join the Mongol Empire. 

[Jin rushes to attack, but stops when he hears his uncle's voice.]

Lord Shimura: Jin.

Khotun Khan: (Laughing.) This… is your time, Lord Sakai.

[They start fighting.]

Khotun Khan: Come here, little bird. Your uncle is watching. Submit, Lord Sakai…

Jin: I'll slit your throat! 

Khotun Khan: Enough. Surrender. Show your uncle how easily he can bring peace to your home. Save yourself.

[In response, Jin slashes his cheek. Furious, Khotun throws Jin off the bridge.]

Jin: (offscreen) I failed… again.

[He remembers his father, all wounded, lying on the doorstep and reaching out to him. A man with a sword walks toward him.]

Young Jin: Father. 

Jin's Father: Jin… Help me! 

[The man kills Jin's father. Some time later, Jin sits in front of his father's armor, bowing… and weeps. The maid enters.]

Yuriko: Young Master. It's time. 

Jin: I'm coming, Yuriko…

[He follows the maid.]

Yuriko: The whole island has come to mourn your father. 

Jin: Can't you send them away? 

Yuriko: You must face them, Jin. You are now the master of clan Sakai.

Jin: Yes.

Yuriko: You're not alone, Jin. Your father is the wind at your back. Your mother the birds in the trees…

Jin: And Uncle?

Yuriko: He will tell you. At your father's pyre. 

Jin: Thank you, Yuriko.

[He goes out into the courtyard. Several men and women stand in front of his house and bow. Jin begins the ascent up the stone stairs leading to the funeral pyre. On either side of the stairs are the grieving friends of the family.]

Masako: If you ever need guidance… clan Adachi will help you.

Ishikawa: Your father protected the people above all else. A true samurai.

[At the top, Jin meets his uncle.]

Jin: I couldn't save him. I was a coward.

Lord Shimura: Jin. You are samurai. 

Jin: He died… because of me. 

Lord Shimura: Your father fell in battle saving his only son. His reward is a warrior's death. Now you… will carry on his legacy. 

[He holds out his father's katana to him.]

Lord Shimura: Your father's spirit resides within this blade. He is always with you. Tomorrow… you will come to my fortress. As my ward. Today… say goodbye to your father.

[The flashback ends. Jin walks slowly down the sandy beach. Exhausted, he falls to his knees before the vast ocean. He picks up his father's katana.]

Jin: Father. How do I save him?

[Suddenly, a rather strong wind comes in from the sea. Jean goes in the direction it blows.]

Yuna: Move.

Jin: Yuna..? 

Yuna: Come on.

Jin: Yuna! 

[He finds the thief archer who saved him.]

Yuna: Jin! What happened? 

Jin: I found Lord Shimura. I could have saved him… but the Khan was there… I failed my uncle. 

Yuna: At least you're in one piece. 

Jin: I swore to protect this island with my life. But now the Mongols have stolen our home. Killed our samurai…

Yuna: You forgot what it's like to fight someone stronger than you. To feel weak. Sometimes, when you're staring death in the face… you have to do whatever it takes to survive.

Jin: The Khan expects to fight a war against the samurai. He will anticipate our every move… unless we find new ways to surprise him. That's how we'll save Lord Shimura—and retake our home.

Yuna: You'll need some help.

Jin: (hears horns) Riders! The Khan's attack dogs.

Yuna: There's too many of them! Hide! In the grass!

[After inspecting the area the Mongol horsemen leave.]

Yuna: They must be searching for you. Bastards scared off the horses.

Jin: They're samurai mounts. Trained to return to their masters.

[He whistles and their horses come back.]

Yuna: Nice trick. The Mongols must be hunting you.

Jin: We should split up. I'll draw their attention while you escape.

Yuna: I'm not leaving your side until we've saved my brother.

Jin: First I need to find more allies. Trained warriors… like Sensei Ishikawa… and Lady Masako Adachi. They can help.

Yuna: My brother can help, too. Once we save him, you'll have the island's best blacksmith in your debt. He'll make whatever tool you need to save your uncle.

Jin: Something to scale the castle walls?

Yuna: You dream it… Taka can make it.

Jin: Where are they holding him?

Yuna: He was captured near Kechi.

Jin: Ride there and ask around. I'll join you soon.

Yuna: Taka won't last long in a Mongol cage.

Jin: Yuna… We will save your brother.

[They split up. For a while, Jin races through a beautiful Japanese forest and rides out into a field strewn with white flowers.]

Sucker Punch presents
GHOST OF TSUSHIMA

ACT 1 - RESCUE OF LORD SHIMURA
[From that moment on, Jin is free to choose his own path. He decides to help Yuna's brother first.]

The Warrior's Code
[Jin gallops after Yuna and finds her just south of the fishing village of Kechi. He hears her voice from afar.]

Yuna: Bastard!

Jin: That's Yuna.

Yuna: Jin! You found me.

[Next to Yuna lies a corpse.]

Jin: You handled that well.

Yuna: I should've heard him coming. Let myself get distracted… These people saw Mongols marching prisoners upriver. They had a blacksmith with them.

Jin: Your brother?

Yuna: Sounds like it. They were taking him to a camp. Near the Kaneda inlet.

Jin: I know the place.

Yuna: Did you find any samurai to free your uncle?

Jin: Not yet. But I'm still searching.

Yuna: I'm sure you'll find someone soon. Taka can help you. After we save him.

[They get on their horses and gallop off to help Yuna's brother.]

Yuna: Hard to believe I might see him soon….

Jin: He's lucky to have you.

Yuna: He might disagree. (сhuckles)

Jin: That's what siblings are for.

Yuna: What about you? Any brothers or sisters?

Jin: Lord Shimura is my only family. 

Yuna: What will you do when he's free?

Jin: Take a breath. Because then I'll know there's hope for our island.

Yuna: You feel that strongly?

Jin: I've watched him win victory against impossible odds. And after your brother is free? What then?

Yuna: Honestly… I haven't had time to think about it. You're riding well. How are your wounds?

Jin: Mostly healed. Your bandages did the trick.

Yuna: You don't share much about how you feel, do you?

Jin: (chuckles) I suppose you're right… My uncle taught me that a samurai masters his emotions. Like you master a horse. Or a blade.

Yuna: That's a hard way to live. 

Jin: It's not supposed to be easy. There's a spot up ahead that overlooks the river.

Yuna: Should give us a good view of the Mongol camp.There's the camp. Tough to get inside.

Jin: The Mongols threw that place together in days. There has to be a way in. Let's look.

Yuna: We need to reach Taka. Without putting him in danger.

Jin: We'll find a safe approach… Defenses in back are formidable. We could scale the rocks on that side.

Yuna: If they're loose, they might give way. Alert the guards.

Jin: The front wall there is still under construction.

Yuna: Could be a way in. We can look for a gap in the front wall. Slip inside…

Jin: And cut down the Mongols where they stand.

Yuna: If something goes wrong… They'll kill the prisoners. I've seen them do it. We have to go in quietly.

Jin: Like thieves.

Yuna: What's wrong with that?

Jin: Before the samurai… This island was ruled by criminals. We changed that by creating order… And delivering justice in the open. We live by a code of honor. And sometimes… We die by it. Warriors like my father who just wanted to give us a safer home.

Yuna: I want the same thing. But we have to fight back.

Jin: I promised my uncle I'd never break our code.

Yuna: Then bend it. To save my family… And what's left of yours.

Jin: Let's get a closer look. See what we're up against.

Yuna: We should wait until it gets darker.

[They slowly squat toward the camp.]

Jin: Let's move.

Yuna: Taka… He's been through a lot. Even before the invasion.

Jin: But you took care of him. 

Yuna: Someone had to. He hated when I stole, but it was that or starve. I didn't have a choice.

Jin: I didn't choose to be a samurai either. But going against my instincts… My code…

Yuna: It's better than getting wiped out by the Mongols. We have to fight back. Any way we can.

Jin: Through here. 

[They climb into the camp through the missing log in the fence and hide behind stacked logs.]

Jin: If they see us, they'll kill the prisoners.

Yuna: Then we'd better stay quiet… and open their throats.

[Jin is forced to go against the samurai code and kill the Mongol stealthily, sneaking up on him from behind. However, the Mongol refuses to die quickly. He begins to scream and Jin covers his mouth with his palm, then rolls him to the ground and stabs him several times with his short blade. As the Mongol dies Jin turns over tiredly and sinks into his memories. He and Lord Shimura are hunting a bear.]

Lord Shimura: What do you think, Jin?

Young Jin: The bear's running with a limp.

Lord Shimura: This is when a beast is most dangerous. Remain alert.

Young Jin: Yes, Uncle.

Lord Shimura: Keep after him.

Young Jin: I didn't think bears lived here.

Lord Shimura: They don't. But the fighting in Yanikawa drove some this way.

Young Jin: So it's the rebels' fault! We should feed them to this bear as punishment.

Lord Shimura: We are not barbarians, Jin.

Young Jin: The bear stumbled here. Is it dying?

Lord Shimura: No. But we're getting closer. Stay ready, Jin.

Young Jin: Yes, uncle. If it's still alive… Can I take the shot?

Lord Shimura: Prove you can control your emotions. Then… Perhaps.

Young Jin: We got him!

Lord Shimura: Careful! He could still be alive. This arrow should not have killed him.

Young Jin: Look, Uncle. There's a gash in his side. Not from an arrow.

[Suddenly Lord Shimura is attacked by an assassin, but he fends off the attack with a sharp lunge.]

Lord Shimura: An assassin! From Yarikawa.

Young Jin: Traitor! You would stab the Jito in the back?

Lord Shimura: Lord Sakai! Control yourself. We are not criminals like this man here. We are samurai.

Young Jin: He tried to kill you. He must answer for this crime with his life.

Lord Shimura: Look him in the eye. And teach him a samurai never acts out of anger or fear.And take his life. With honor.

[Jin approaches the kneeling assassin and kills him with one precise blow.]

Lord Shimura: When we fight, we face our enemy head-on. And when we take their life, we look them in the eye. With courage and respect. This is what makes us samurai. Only cowards strike from the shadows.

[Jin comes to his senses. He stares for some time at the Mongol he killed.]

Yuna: Jin… What's wrong?

Jin: Let's find your brother. We can't let them see us. 

Yuna: Use all your senses. Think and move like a thief.

[They walk quietly through the camp. Jin kills the Mongols by attacking them from behind and has no more regrets.]

Yuna: There. A prisoner!

Jin: Taka? 

Yuna: Let's find out. No… It's not Taka.

[Jin frees the prisoner anyway.]

Straw Hat: How'd you get in here?

Jin: We need to go. We'll talk when it's safe.

Yuna: Come on.

Jin: Let's get to the river. We'll be safe there. Are you with the Straw Hat ronin?

Straw Hat: I was. Cut ties with 'em after they started running low on rations.

Jin: Lord Shimura's been captured. I could use some extra swords to free him. Are you looking for work?

Straw Hat: No, but the other Straw Hats may be. Last I heard, they were hunting Mongols in Tsutsu prefecture. By the coast near the Kishi Grasslands.

Yuna: This way. We're looking for my brother. A blacksmith named Taka.

Straw Hat: Don't know him, but a lot of prisoners move through here.

Yuna: You said they were moving the slaves. Where? 

Straw Hat: They mentioned Azamo Bay. And there was a blacksmith in the last group. A young man with a beard. From Yarikawa, maybe.

Yuna: You'd better be right.

Straw Hat: I hope you find your blacksmith.

Yuna: Taka's alive in Azamo Bay.

Jin: The town is surrounded by walls. Rushing in without a plan will only put him in more danger.

Yuna: I have a friend who might be able to get us inside.

Jin: Find him. The sooner we rescue Taka, the sooner we save my uncle.

Yuna: Jin… Taka will forge whatever tool you need as soon as he's free. But after that… We're leaving the island.

Jin: You've seen what the Mongols are doing here. Lord Shimura can stop them. Stay. Help us fight for our home.

Yuna: Home… Is wherever Taka and I go. My friend lives in Azamo prefecture. On the border with Tsutsu.

Jin: I'll find you there.

Yuna: I know this wasn't easy. Going against your code.

Jin: I did what I had to.

Yuna: Thank you.

[Meanwhile, at Castle Kaneda, Khotun came to talk to the caged Shimura.]

Khotun Khan: Lord Shimura. You deserve better than this. Convince your people to stop resisting, and you can walk free.

Lord Shimura: Stop wasting my time. Kill me.

Khotun Khan: You think you've lost everything. But your nephew is still alive.

Lord Shimura: Jin…

Khotun Khan: My men control the roads. They build war camps near your towns. They see everything. And they will find him.

Lord Shimura: Lord Sakai will fight until his last breath. As will I.

Khotun Khan: You love him. Just as you love your people. You are a father to them. Will you abandon your children?

Lord Shimura: I won't make them your slaves.

[The Warrior's Code completed. After killing another Mongol with a stab in the back, Jin recalls his uncle's words.]

Lord Shimura: Jin. We look them in the eye… with courage. Only cowards strike from the shadows.

Jin: Forgive me, Uncle.

[Jin rides into a small camp of peasants who have had to flee from the advancing Mongols.]

Peasant: May the kami protect your path, my lord.

Jin: My mother believed Inari is my guardian. She saw a fox chasing fireflies outside our home the day I was born.

Peasant: She knew that foxes are Inari's messengers in our world.

Peasant: When you see one, always follow where it leads.

Jin: I will. Thank you.

Merchant: Do you need anything, my lord? Lord Sakai…? You survived the invasion?

Jin: So far. Have we met before?

Merchant: No, my lord. But I watched you ride into battle. Please accept this gift. If you wear it, they say a spirit will lead you to whatever you're looking for.

Jin: Sounds like something you could use yourself.

Merchant: Not with Mongols prowling the countryside. But if it leads you to any flowers… bring them to me—or other traders. We can use them to fashion dyes.

Jin: I'll remember that. Thank you.

Merchant: I hope the roads remain clear for you, my lord.

Peasant: Another samurai? Alive? I thought Lord Jinroku was the only one.

Jin: I don't know the name…

Peasant: He's in Kashine, my lord. I'm sure he'd be happy to see you.

Jin: I'm curious to meet him…

Trapper: Do you need a new quiver or satchel?

The Broken Blacksmith
Yuna: Keep quiet.

Kenji: You want quiet? Don't ask me to rile up people who drink horse blood.

Yuna: I wasn't asking. Not after Komatsu.

Kenji: That was a misunderstanding...

Yuna: That was a scary sake merchant trying to wriggle out of trouble.

Kenji: And it worked! I offloaded that sour rice water, and you—

Yuna: —have to look over my shoulder. For a month.

Kenji: You're paranoid.

Yuna: You owe me, Kenji.

Kenji: (Sighs.)

[Jin enters the house.]

Yuna: Taka's counting on us.

Kenji: I love the kid, but this is too dangerous. It will never work.

Jin: We'll make it work.

Kenji: This the samurai?

Jin: You can call me Lord Sakai.

Kenji: (bows) Forgive me... my lord. I am Kenji. Upstanding merchant... renowned sake brewer—

Yuna: And the best swindler on the island. That's why he's going to help us rescue my brother from Azamo Bay.

Kenji: That town's a fortress!

Jin: If the Mongols took it, we'll need an army to penetrate the walls. 

Yuna: Or... A single delivery of sake.

Kenji: (laughs) It'll never work.

Jin: Get your sake ready. Will discuss the plan on the move.

Kenji: Let's have a drink first. Talk this through... 

Yuna: Now, Kenji.

[They leave the house. Kenji prepares the cart and loads it with sake.]

Kenji: When we get close to the town, you can hide in the car with the sake.

Jin: The Mongols won't search it?

Kenji: Not anymore. It's the same sake delivery I always sell them. They love my "dars." "Dars, mulgu! Give Dars now!"

Jin: You've been doing business with the enemy.

Kenji: I keep the Mongols drunk and they let me keep my head. All set. You sure you want to go through with this?

Yuna: Anything for Taka.

Jin: How bad is the occupation in Azamo Bay?

Kenji: A few people fought back. The ones left alive are  prisoners... or slaves.

Yuna: But you never saw Taka?

Kenji: No. But someone's been working the forge the past few days. Maybe it's your brother.

Jin: How long have you two known each other?

Yuna: Since I was too young to know better.

Kenji: I was just starting to brew sake. Sold Yuna my first batch.

Yuna: Tasted like piss, but it was cheap.

Kenji: For a while, I tried to get Taka's help selling it. Turned out he was too soft… 

Yuna: People told him sob stories, and he'd give them sake. Free of charge. 

[They come closer to the town.]

Yuna: Mongols.

Kenji: Damn. You two better get in the cart.

Jin: There aren't many. I can handle them.

Yuna: No, Jin. Taka is so close. Please.

Jin: All right.

[He hides in the cart. Kenji keeps moving toward the Mongol camp.]

Kenji: Get ready. They might search the cart.

Jin: You said they don't do that.

Kenji: At the town gates. I've never seen them this far out here.

Mongols: You! Stop!

Kenji: Dars! Dars for Azamo Bay!

Mongol: Ah, dars. Hurry up! (chuckling)

Kenji: (Sigh of relief) Just a little farther.

Yuna: What was all that screaming?

Kenji: Doesn't matter. Keep it down.

Yuna: Is that what Taka's going through?

Jin: Your brother's a skilled blacksmith. They won't treat him like that.

Yuna: You don't know that.

[The cart slowly drives up to the gate to the town.]

Kenji: We're getting close. Quiet.

Mongol: Türgen khii.

Mongol: Mulgu! Butsad irj!

[They laugh and open the gates.]

Yuna: (Sigh of relief)

Kenji: I can't believe this worked. Oh no… Somebody must've pissed off the Mongols. They burned half the town.

[The cart stops. Jin and Yuna leave it.]

Kenji: This is where we part ways...

Jin: Keep the Mongols drunk—and distracted.

Kenji: I'll do my best.

Jin: Stay safe, Kenji.

Kenji: And you, Lord Sakai.

Yuna: Taka's waiting for us. Let's go!

[They sneak through the town.]

Kenji: Once we're done, I'll meet you at the crossroads behind town.

Jin: We need a vantage point to scout ahead.

Yuna: This way…

Jin: Remember. No alarms. We do this quietly—

Yuna: Or the prisoners suffer. Got it.

Kenji: (from afar) Invaders! You look thirsty! Come get your delicious dars! 

Yuna: Up here. Look. By the gate.

Kenji: (from afar) And choke on it.

Jin: He's in charge. A slaver.

Yuna: Bastard.

Jin: He's inspecting the prisoners. Like they're horses.

Yuna: He might lead us to Taka.

Jin: Follow him.

[They follow the slaver trying not to expose themselves.]

Mongol: Noyontoon, eneguravdahaa zugtahig zavdlaa.

Mongol: Tolgoi zoogood busdad haruul. Bieig n shataa.

Mongol: Za, noyontoon.

Yuna: Taka's probably fine. He wouldn't try to run.

Jin: Let’s go.

[He assassinates a Mongol from the roof and remembers something…]

Lord Shimura: Jin. We look them in the eye… with courage. Only cowards strike from the shadows.

Young Jin: Forgive me, Uncle.

[Jin continue sneaking through the town.]

Yuna: Taka's probably fine. He wouldn't try to run.

[Jin sees a peasant tortured my Mongols.]

Peasant: I… I won't be your slave.

Mongol: Naadhaa sain tandaarai.

Mongol: Ologlo.

Mongol: Noyontoon bi eniig oilgohgui yum.

Mongol: What is problem?

Peasant:Your blacksmith, Taka. His work is shoddy, I think he's sabotaging you.

Yuna: (quietly) I knew it, Taka's here…

Mongol: He is only blacksmith.

Peasant: I'm a blacksmith, too. And I'll do much better work.

Mongol: I can not feed two. I get rid of him. But be ready to prove yourself.

Yuna: (quietly) That bastard. He'll kill Taka!

Jin: Market's full of Mongols.

Yuna: We can't lose the slaver. If he reaches Taka first…

Jin: Stay close, Yuna. I find a way through.

[He continues to follow the slaver, killing Mongols along the way.]

Jin: The slaver. 

Yuna: Can't let him get away…

[The slave-trader brings Jin and Yuna to the forge. Taka is severely exhausted from his constant work.]

Mongol: (laughs) Bidnig orhi.

Taka: No. Please. I need to rest…

Yuna: It’s Taka!

[The mongol swings in to deliver a deadly blow to the exhausted blacksmith...]

Taka: Please!

[...but Yuna, coming up behind, kills the Mongol with her katana.]

Taka: Yuna.

Yuna: (crying) Taka!

[They hug.]

Yuna: What did they do to you? You’re safe now.

Jin: We need to move.

Taka: We can’t. They'll catch us just like the others.

Yuna: This is Lord Sakai. He'll protect us.

Jin: I need you to trust me, Taka. I need your help.

Taka: I'll try, my lord.

[Yuna helps him up. Now the heroes need to leave the Mongol camp without raising the alarm.]

Taka: There's a gate nearby.

Jin: Then that's where we break out.

[As they approach the gate, the sound of a horn is heard.]

Yuna: They found the slaver.

Taka: They'll kill us. We need to hide!

Jin: No. Keep moving.

Yuna: We can climb those crates.

[They leave the town.]

Taka: Where are we going?

Jin: Kenji's waiting for us at a crossroads.

Taka: Kenji's with you?

Yuna: If he made it out alive.

[They approach the crossroads.]

Taka: Horses! They're coming for us!

Jin: Get in the tall grass. And stay down.

Yuna: It’s Kenji!

Kenji: Taka! You made it!

Jin: Were you followed? 

Kenji: No, but we can't g0 back to my place. It's crawling with Mongols.

Yuna: We should go.

Jin: We have to put some distance between us and Azamo Bay.

[They saddle their horses and ride till sunruse.]

Yuna: Haven't seen a Mongol since dawn. I think we're clear.

Jin: We need to figure out where to go next.

Kenji: There's a place up ahead where you can see most of Izuhara.

Jin: Everyone all right?

Yuna: I could use a drink. And some sleep.

Kenji: I can help with one of those.

Jin: Taka? You've been quiet.

Taka: First time in days I haven't felt like I was about to die. My lord. I am grateful. But how do you know Kenji and my sister? 

Jin: I owe Yuna my life.

Taka: (Nervous laugh.) We have something in common.

[They get off their horses at Archer’s Rise.]

Kenji: (Groan.) I'm not built for riding all night.

Yuna: Komatsu is just over that ridge.

Jin: They have a forge.

Taka: One of the best on the island.

Yuna: Good place to make tools. Maybe something to get Jin over the walls of Castle Kaneda. What do you say, Taka?

Taka: My lord, I'll do anything to repay you for freeing me.

Jin: Thank you. Taka, Kenji… get some rest. We can't stay here long. (to Yuna) How are you doing?

Yuna: I have my brother back.

Jin: He's shaken up. Can you get him to Komatsu in one piece?

Yuna: With food and rest, he'll be fine.

Jin: Your brother wasn't the only prisoner in Azamo Bay.

Yuna: You're going to save them.

Jin: And make their captors suffer.

Yuna: Good.

Jin: Ride for Komatsu Forge. I’ll join you when I can.

Yuna: Jin. Thank you.

[Jin nods. “The Broken Blacksmith” completed.]

[Jin decides to go looking for Sensei Ishikawa. The first thing he does is hop over to his house.]

Jin: Sensei Ishikawa's dojo. There was a struggle here. Better look around. Someone was wounded. Removed the arrow. Dried blood. The fight wasn't recent. Bloody footprints. The victim, or the attacker? Maybe the sensei is in his house. A humble home for a samurai.

[He finds Sensei in a small outbuilding of the house. He has already drawn his bowstring and is preparing to meet the stranger.]

Ishikawa: Don't move.

Jin: Sensei Ishikawa?

[Sensei puts the bow down.]

Ishikawa: Lord Sakai's boy. You survived Komoda.

Jin: We could have used your bow.

Ishikawa: I was on my way when bandits attacked me.

Jin: Are you expecting them to return?

Ishikawa: A samurai is never caught by surprise. I'm sorry about Lord Shimura. He was a good man.

Jin: He's alive. Taken captive by the Mongols.

Ishikawa: Then there's hope.

Jin: That's why I've come. Help me save him.

Ishikawa: I can't. My student is missing. A skilled archer…

Jin: I will help you look. Then you can both help me free Lord Shimura.

Ishikawa: Try and keep up, Sakai.

The Tale of Sensei Ishikawa
Ishikawa: Who else made it out of Komoda?

Jin: No one knows.

Ishikawa: Are there any others who can fight back?

Jin: Besides us? I don't know yet.

Ishikawa: You'd better find out quickly. We can't free your uncle by ourselves.

Jin: I can help track your student. 

Ishikawa: I need no help tracking Tomoe.

Jin: Tomoe? A woman. From what clan?

Ishikawa: No clan. A peasant. But she can outshoot any samurai I know. (Chuckle) Even you, Sakai. 

Jin: The last time I saw you was ten years ago.

Ishikawa: You came to study with me.

Jin: You remember?

Ishikawa: I remember most of the students I reject.

Jin: Instead you took this Tomoe as your student.

Ishikawa: You showed promise. Tomoe is a prodigy.

[Several Mongols stand in their way.]

Jin: Come here and fight!

[Together with Sensei, Jin easily disposes of them.]

Ishikawa: They fight like drunk tanuki.

Jin: They fought well enough at Komoda.

Ishikawa: Even tanuki can catch a tiger when it's sleeping. Tomoe's trail picks up here. Come. The Mongols took Fort Nakayama. That patrol likely came from there.

Jin: That's close to the hot springs. 

Ishikawa: The town will be the next to fall.

[They find a small camp.]

Jin: Something happened here.

Ishikawa: An ambush. Look around.

Jin: Blood. But not much.

Ishikawa: No one died.

Jin: A Japanese quiver.

Ishikawa: A gift… To my greatest student.

Jin: Rice and millet. Left uneaten.

Ishikawa: The attack was sudden. I fear the worst. Tomoe would never leave that quiver behind. Unless she was pursued. Or captured.

Jin: To what end?

Ishikawa: Interrogation, torture. Worse…

Jin: They may be doing the same to Lord Shimura.

Ishikawa: Fear is a weapon, Sakai. Do not let the Mongols use it against you.

Jin: Your student. Where would they take her?

Ishikawa: Fort Nakayama. The fort is nearby. I'm going this way, Sakai. I should have fought at Komoda with you.

Jin: Better you didn't. We lost enough there.

Ishikawa: Why did the samurai fail?

Jin: The Mongols fought like animals.

Ishikawa: Wrong answer. 

Jin: I saw it with my own eyes. 

Ishikawa: An archer's aim relies not on eyes… But on body, mind, and spirit. Stop here. We need to talk.

Jin: What's wrong, Sensei?

Ishikawa: This bow was a gift to me from Lord Nagao many years ago.

Jin: It's a beautiful weapon.

Ishikawa: Of course it is. And there's nothing more painful to me than a perfect bow ineptly used.

Jin: Then it's a good thing you're giving it to me.

Ishikawa: Who said anything about giving? Prove you can shoot straight. And I'll let you borrow it. Try it out before we go into battle. Aim for that lamp closest to us. Good. Now the one further down the road. On the left. Not bad. Let's see if you can hit the one furthest away. The further the target, the more your arrow drops. How does it feel? 

Jin: Like it was made for me. 

Ishikawa: It wasn't. So take good care of it. Let's go. 

Jin: A bow like this would have helped at Komoda.

Ishikawa: It is a good bow. But victory is won by warriors, not weapons.

Jin: You haven't seen the Mongols' fire weapons.

Ishikawa: And they have not yet won. Fort Nakayama.

Jin: I hope your student is inside.

Ishikawa: We'll get a better look at their defenses from up there. This spot is perfect.

Jin: I'll find a way in, open the gate. Then we hit them.

Ishikawa: Do you always charge into battle with your hakama half-tied?

Jin: You have a better idea?

Ishikawa: Patience, Sakai… The Mongols will send men to find their missing patrol. When they open the gates, we strike.

Jin: The longer we delay, the longer Tomoe remains in danger.

Ishikawa: She can take care of herself. Survey the battlefield. What can we use to our advantage?

Jin: Hornet nests. One shot could stir them up.

Ishikawa: The Mongols will face the sting of insects and arrows.

Jin: Those barrels could do some damage.

Ishikawa: We'll find out.

Jin: An arrow in those hanging lights will kick up sparks.

Ishikawa: And start fires.

Jin: They have many archers.

Ishikawa: They're skilled. But we are better. When the gates open. Distract the enemy. And rain arrows on their heads.

Jin: Then we storm the fort. And free Tomoe.

Ishikawa: Good. Now we wait.

[Some time later.]

Jin: They're opening the gates.

Ishikawa: Wait for my signal. Get ready… Now! Send them to their ancestors.

[Jin uses the bow and his surroundings to defeat the Mongols.]

Ishikawa: (heavy breathing) Not bad, Sakai.

Jin: There are more inside.

Ishikawa: Not for long. Let's find Tomoe.

[Jin and Ishikawa kill all the Mongols in the fort and capture it. They find a pile of corpses.]

Ishikawa: Slain prisoners.

Jin: Tied up. Killed with arrows.

Ishikawa: Tomoe isn't… Wait… This pendant belongs to her… Search the fort! Someone's personal quarters.

Jin: A woman's kimono.

Ishikawa: Tomoe's kimono.

Jin: The Mongols freed her. Why? These arrows are Japanese.

Ishikawa: They're Tomoe's arrows.

Jin: You're sure?

Ishikawa: I taught her to make the nock with deer horn. And that curve of the eagle feathers.

Jin: So the Mongols took her weapons.

Ishikawa: The shots are tightly clustered. No Mongol shoots Japanese arrows with such skill.

Jin: Then they allowed her to use a bow. A scroll. Archery terms with Mongolian translations. Your name is mentioned.

Ishikawa: She was teaching them my Way of the Bow.

Peasant: Help. Help me.

Ishikawa: Do you hear that?

Jin: A survivor.

Peasant: Help. Please. So… cold.

Ishikawa: We're looking for a woman. An archer.

Peasant: The Mongols caged her with us. But… but they set her free. Gave her armor and a bow. She killed my wife. And the others.

Jin: The bodies we found.

Ishikawa: She proved her skill to the enemy. And they recruited her.

Peasant: Please. It… It hurts. Don't leave me. (dies)

Ishikawa: I've seen enough. Let's go. I should have killed her.

Jin: Sensei?

Ishikawa: Tomoe won her freedom. She joined the Mongols.

Jin: Why would she do that? What happened?

Ishikawa: I pushed her too hard.

Jin: Pushed her how? What are you hiding? Sensei! I demand an answer.

Ishikawa: She attacked me. Not bandits. Tomoe!

Jin: Why?

Ishikawa: She has no idea what it means to be samurai.

Jin: You drove her to the Mongols.

Ishikawa: Do not judge me.

Jin: Do not lie to me.

Ishikawa: I can't let Tomoe… teach my Way of the Bow to the enemy.

Jin: Then we will stop her.

Ishikawa: This is my fight. I don't need your weapon.

Jin: No. You need me. Victory is won by warriors. Not weapons.

Ishikawa: Lord Shimura raised you well. We'll hunt Tomoe together, but we do it my way.

Jin: And when the time comes… You will help rescue my uncle.

Ishikawa: You have my word, Sakai. I will prepare to hunt Tomoe. When you are ready… Meet me at my dojo.

Jin: We can't rescue my uncle alone. I need more people to join our fight.

Ishikawa: Find Lady Masako Adachi. If she's still alive… She's one of the finest warriors on the island.

The Sensei and The Student
Jin: Sensei, any word on Tomoe?

Ishikawa: Yes. But I'm not sure you are ready for her.

Jin: You make her sound like a demon.

Ishikawa: That's not far off the mark. Tomoe is fearless. She is not samurai, but she is a born killer.

Jin: I know the type.

Ishikawa: No. You do not. Come. 

Jin: Where are we headed?

Ishikawa: An archery range. A local saw Mongols training there. I suspect Tomoe was with them.

Jin: If Tomoe is truly fearless, she'd make a useful ally.

Ishikawa: A starving leopard is fearless, too.

Jin: Leopards can't master your way of the bow.

Ishikawa: Let it go, Sakai. She will never join us.

Jin: Why did she turn against you?

Ishikawa: I took a risk sharing all I knew with her. When she betrayed my trust, I punished her.

Jin: It must have been harsh.

Ishikawa: You saw what she did to the prisoners at Fort Nakayama. That was no mistake. And not the first time she's made it.

Jin: We don't know it was her fault.

Ishikawa: You don't. I do. You have to climb to get there.

Jin: Sure you can make it, Sensei?

Ishikawa: What are you waiting for, Sakai? 

Jin: You need a hand, Sensei?

Ishikawa: Not bad, Sakai.

Jin: You said the only way up was to climb.

Ishikawa: No, I said you had to climb. It's good exercise. Arrows. Mongol and Japanese.

Jin: If they were here, they're long gone.

Ishikawa: We might pick up their trail by the practice target.

Jin: There is no target.

Ishikawa: (shoot an arrow) Near that watch tower.

Jin: Not bad, Sensei.

Ishikawa: Find out where they went. Move it, Sakai.

[Jin goes to the place where Sensei's arrow flew and finds the shooting range there.]

Jin: How many Mongols is Tomoe training?

[He looks around.]

Jin: A severed head. Used for target practice. Sensei! Mongols here! Sensei!

[He has to confront a whole troop of Mongols. There are also archers among them.]

Jin: I could use your help.

[Despite a very unequal fight, Jin manages to defeat the Mongols.]

Ishikawa: Good work, Sakai.

Jin: Resting your bow arm, Sensei?

Ishikawa: Observing your response to an ambush.

Jin: You knew those Mongols were still here.

Ishikawa: Yes.

Jin: You didn't think to mention it?

Ishikawa: If you can't handle a few Mongols, what good will you be against Tomoe?

Jin: This is war—not a test.

Ishikawa: And how many wars have you fought?

[Jin shuts up.]

Ishikawa: I'll test you as I see fit.

Jin: I can see why Tomoe attacked you.

Ishikawa: (Laughs) Now. Where did she go, Sakai?

Jin: I'll look around. A lot of tracks. A dozen men, maybe more.

Ishikawa: Follow the trail. If we catch her, do not wait for me. Attack, and keep moving. Or you'll die.

Jin: Do you plan to use your bow this time?

Ishikawa: If we find her.

Jin: And if not?

Ishikawa: Can you take a dozen enemy soldiers without me?

Jin: If I must.

Ishikawa: Good answer.

[The trail leads Jin and Ishikawa to the camp of the Mongol archers.]

Jin: Look at them!

Ishikawa: They're practicing what Tomoe taught them.

Jin: Murdering the innocent.

[He kills the Mongols with an arrow and slay their leader with his katana.]

Peasant: Over here!

Jin: Did you see a Japanese woman with these Mongols?

Peasant: I couldn't believe it. She was giving them orders!

Jin: What did she say?

Peasant: Something about the sensei. And the hot springs. That's all I heard, my lord. Forgive me.

Ishikawa: I taught a monster how to hunt.

Jin: They heard Tomoe giving orders to the Mongols. She mentioned Hiyoshi Springs.

Ishikawa: She's just getting started. Sakai. The way you fight… It's not your uncle's way, and it's not mine.

Jin: We've never faced an enemy like this. I do what I must to defeat them.

Ishikawa: A samurai is a guardian. Not a killer who darts around like a thief.

Jin: You didn't see Komoda.

Ishikawa: I've seen enough. I know it was brutal. But I won't train another monster.

Jin: I know. I won't let that happen.

Ishikawa: If Tomoe is going after Hiyoshi Springs… I need to prepare. So do you. I'll see you at my dojo, Sakai.

[After completing the mission, Jin decides to take a little rest and explore his surroundings. He climbs the watchtower.]

Peasant: Have you seen the birds, Lord Sakai?

Jin: What birds are you looking for?

Peasant: The golden ones. Songs that remind you of more peaceful times.

Jin: Ah. They were my mother's favorite. She used to say they knew our island better than any other creature.

Peasant: I believe it, my lord. If it weren't so dangerous, I'd follow one. See where the golden bird leads me.

Jin: Maybe I'll do just that. But you should wait until our home is safe once more.

Peasant: I will, Lord Sakai. Thank you.

[There is a hot spring nearby. It's time to relax a little!]

Jin: (reflects) I thought they'd killed Lord Shimura. After everything he's done for me, everything he taught me… I can't lose my uncle. I won't.

The Past Never Passes
Jin: Any news of Tomoe?

Ishikawa: Travelers have been shot dead on the roads in and out of Hiyoshi Springs. People are afraid to leave, or deliver supplies.

Jin: You think that's her doing?

Ishikawa: A few archers at strategic points can isolate a whole town.

Jin: A tactic of yours when you were clan Nagao's archery master.

Ishikawa: Tomoe was a good student.

Jin: Too good. We're fighting your own reflection.

Ishikawa: We will turn that to our advantage. Come.

[After climbing the mountain, Jin and Ishikawa look around to determine exactly how their opponent will act.]

Jin: How do you propose we find these archers?

Ishikawa: We think like Tomoe. We want to control movement in and out of Hiyoshi Springs. Where do we put archers?

Jin: That path behind the inn.

Ishikawa: No. Poor cover, no clear lines of sight. You want to cover the largest territory with the fewest archers.

Jin: It would be smart to control the main entrance into town.

Ishikawa: People already avoid the main road. Archers there would be wasted.

Jin: A handful of men could shut down the road to the coast.

Ishikawa: Yes.

Jin: I would want someone looking over the bridge into town.

Ishikawa: So would I.

Jin: The road south runs along a high ridge. Perfect place to rain down arrows.

Ishikawa: Tomoe would agree. There's hope for you. Let's go hunting.

[Jin comes down the mountain and finds a strange peasant sitting on a rock.]

Peasant: Lord Sakai. I studied poetry with your uncle.

Jin: The Mongols have taken Lord Shimura captive.

Peasant: He will endure. He is strong and resilient… Skilled in the art of combat… and poetry. Do you practice haiku, my lord?

Jin: There is no time during war.

Peasant: War is the reason to make time. Haiku allows one to concentrate. Eliminate chaos.

Jin: To find peace.

Peasant: Precisely. My favorite place to write lies atop the cliff. It is one of many such places. If you look, you will find inspiration all across Tsushima.

Jin: I hope I can find quiet places like this one, untouched by war.

Peasant: Look for the birds. They will show you the way.

[Jin reunites with Ishikawa.]

Jin: What else did you teach Tomoe?

Ishikawa: I held back nothing.

Jin: Including why you left clan Nagao?

Ishikawa: We're getting close. Eyes open.

[They approach the place where the Mongols are staying. Jin comes out of hiding and loudly announces.]

Jin: Challenge me!

[He kills all the approaching Mongols.]

Jin: Tomoe wasn't here.

Ishikawa: Keep moving.

Jin: All those innocent dead. Tomoe has thrown everything away. Betrayed her people.

Ishikawa: She is a traitor because the Mongols offer power, wealth, status. Things denied her by birth.

Jin: Tomoe knew she was born to a lower station than she deserved.

Ishikawa: Now you're being too kind.

Jin: Kindness can be useful—even to a warrior.

Ishikawa: Who told you that? Sun Tzu?

Jin: My uncle. And he didn't tell me—he showed me. Mercy creates a debt.

Ishikawa: Your uncle showed mercy to people who posed no danger to him. A safe bet.

Jin: How did Tomoe become your student?

Ishikawa: She showed up at my dojo with her father's makeshift hunting bow and refused to leave.

Jin: You didn't turn her away.

Ishikawa: I tried.

Ishikawa: I tried. But she sank arrow after arrow into my targets. I'd never seen talent like hers.

Jin: She must have had training. 

Ishikawa: Her form was wrong. Would've been useless in a real fight. But she had no fear of missing a shot. She never hesitated.

Jin: A warrior's spirit.

Ishikawa: No—a killer's. I didn't see until it was too late.

[They encounter another group of Mongols.]

Jin: Who will face me first?

[He kills all his attackers. Jin also defeats the leader of the group but does not kill him.]

Mongol: Sensei Ishikawa!

Jin: You know the name Ishikawa?

Mongol: I do. I have message.

Ishikawa: Speak.

Mongol: Sensei, all of Hiyoshi Springs will beg for mercy. Like the victims of Hironori Nagao.

Ishikawa: Silence!

[He kills the Mongol with his bow with the speed of a hawk.]

Jin: Hironori Nagao… Didn't he die fighting bandits?

Ishikawa: It was decades ago. 

Jin: He was reputed to be a great archer… Did he study with you?

Ishikawa: No. Tomoe is spreading lies.

Jin: But there's a seed of truth.

Ishikawa: She wants us to doubt each other. We are all that stands between Hiyoshi Springs and a bloodbath.

Jin: Then we stand together.

Ishikawa: We'll plan the town's defense at my dojo. Meet me there, and be ready to fight.

The Way of the Bow
Ishikawa: We must deal with Tomoe's threat against Hiyoshi Springs before it's too late.

Jin: I don't understand her fixation on the town.

Ishikawa: I was born there. Destroying it proves her worth to the Mongols. And humiliates me.

Jin: But the terrain works in our favor. Two skilled archers can hold off hundreds.

Ishikawa: Or we allow the Mongols to take it. Tomoe wins a victory, and lets her guard down. Then we strike.

Jin: Sacrifice Hiyoshi Springs for Tomoe…

Ishikawa: The sacrifice is worth it.

Jin: Tomoe would agree, Sensei.

Ishikawa: Fine, Sakai. She will attack from the north. We should focus our efforts there.

Jin: Scout elevated positions, place arrows, and…

Ishikawa: Listen. Did you hear that?

[The dojo is attacked by Mongols.]

Ishikawa: One arrow, one death!

[While Ishikawa shoots his bow, Jin cuts down the attackers with his sword. Soon all the Mongols are slain.]

Ishikawa: I wondered when Tomoe's new friends would visit.

Jin: If the point was to kill us, she would have sent more men.

Ishikawa: Or the point was not to kill. But to delay.

Jin: Hiyoshi Springs. The attack is starting.

[They run to the springs.]

Ishikawa: This way. If I fall today promise me you will keep hunting Tomoe.

Jin: The Mongols are my priority. Not her.

Ishikawa: She fights for more than power and territory. Tomoe's actions attack what it means to be samurai.

Jin: What she does is no reflection on me. I will meet my duty as a warrior.

Ishikawa: She knows you're my student. Your death will destroy my legacy.

Jin: Your Way of the Bow will survive with me. Where will Tomoe strike?

Ishikawa: In the back town, near the waterfalls. The most vulnerable point.

Jin: If we get there before the Mongols, we can prepare a defense. But it won't be easy.

Ishikawa: It never is.

Jin: You two! Come here!

Peasant: What is it, my lords?

Jin: Mongols are heading for Hiyoshi Springs.

Ishikawa: Gather everyone at the inn, and stay out of sight. We will deal with them.

Peasant: Yes, my lords!

Ishikawa: Good sight lines over here. The Mongols won't be able to flank us. We don't have much time. What can we use to our advantage. Not many options.

Jin: We'll exploit the ones we have. Those barrels could do some damage. Dry grass. Lure the Mongols in…

Ishikawa: We'll make sure you have flaming arrows.

Jin: Hornets' nests.

Ishikawa: Excellent distraction. Take these flaming arrows. And try not to burn yourself. Or me.

Jin: Then don't get in my way, Sensei.

Ishikawa: Get ready. The Mongols will be here soon.

[They hear the roar of the battle horn coming from afar.]

Jin: They're getting closer.

Ishikawa: Good. Let's demonstrate the way of the Bow for them. They're coming downhill. Take them.

Jin: One arrow, one death, Sensei.

Ishikawa: Not bad, Sakai.

Jin: I'm ready for more.

Ishikawa: So are they.Coming down the main road!

Jin: I've got them.

Ishikawa: That's the last of them. It's over.

Jin: For now.

Ishikawa: Ah. There she is.

[In the distance, at the top of the mountain, a woman is standing by the house.]

Jin: That's Tomoe?

Ishikawa: Burning the Nagao banner.

Jin: We can catch her.

Ishikawa: She'll be long gone by the time we get there.

Jin: She's a coward.

Ishikawa: No. She's mocking me. She knows the last student I trained before her was Hironori Nagao.

Jin: You said he wasn't your student. Which is it?

Ishikawa: I was young. Prideful, callous. Hironori learned from my example. He led a rebellion to seize the clan… And lost. But only after butchering Lord Nagao's best men.

Jin: Hironori didn't die fighting bandits.

Ishikawa: That was a story to protect Nagao's legacy. There was no saving mine. As his teacher, I could never be trusted again. I was… Granted the mercy to resign my position. I convinced myself the Way of the Bow had to survive. But the truth is… I am a coward who should have ended it long ago.

Jin: You told Tomoe all of this.

Ishikawa: I wanted her… To understand what it meant for me to teach again. And like everything else… She turned it against me.

Jin: You'll never redeem Hironori Nagao. And you won't change Tomoe. But today, you saved the people of Hiyoshi Springs.

Ishikawa: With my new student.

Jin: I'll need you at Castle Kaneda.

Ishikawa: My bow is yours. But Tomoe isn't done yet. We must keep hunting her.

Jin: We will, Sensei.

[The mission ends. Jin continues to explore Tsushima and finds a peasant standing by a long suspension bridge. He shouts something.]

Incident At Hiyoshi Pass (side quest)
Peasant: Be brave, Banta! We'll save you, my boy!  Stop it, you animals! My lord! They've taken the bridge.

Jin: Tell me…

Peasant: We were running for Hiyoshi Springs. The bridge looked safe, but the Mongols were in the ravine. They started shooting from below…

Jin: Someone's injured.

Peasant: Banta. My brother's boy.

Jin: They're using him as bait. Tell your family to stay clear of the bridge. I'll stop this.

Mongol: Keep screaming, runt! Your family's leaving you lo die! (laughs)

Mongol: Ter sheesh aldgin.

Mongol: Uijil baig. Avrah gej irsen hunign al.

[Jin begins mercilessly killing the Mongols.]

Jin: There's still more out there. That's the last of them. Now for the boy.

[He saves the boy.]

Peasant: Have they stopped shooting?

Jin: It is over. Go to your family.

Peasant: Thank you, my lord.

Jin: The bridge is clear! The Mongols are gone.

Peasant: Did they scream?

Jin: Their suffering isn't your concern. Take your family to Hiyoshi Springs. These roads are dangerous.

Peasant: We will. Thank you.

The Tale Of Lady Masako
[Jin goes to Adachi Manor in search of Lady Masako. There he meets several old acquaintances.]

Kiheiji: My lord! You made it… I came straight here. Stayed off the roads. Just like you said, Lord Sakai.

Jin: I'm glad you got here safely. How is your little one holding up?

Kiheiji: He's braver than his father. People didn't believe it when I told them a samurai sent us here.

Jin: Take care of yourself. And the little one.

Kiheiji: The people here don't have much to offer—but we'll do everything we can to help. (to the child) See that? I told you. There's always hope.

Peasant: Lord Sakai!

Jin: It's good to see you… Gonjiro, right? You served Lord Nagao. He was a good man. I'm sorry we lost him.

Peasant: I'm honored you recall a humble household servant. So many of us here owe you our lives.

Jin: I'm afraid the fight for our home is just beginning.

Peasant: That's why we want to help, my lord. People started donating what they could, and… please accept these gifts.

Jin: Thank you, Gonjiro. And everyone else who contributed.

Peasant: We'll keep donating what we can here and elsewhere, as word of your victories spread. May the kami keep you from harm!

[He enters the grounds of the estate itself.]

Jin: Clan Adachi's estate. Lady Masaka should be here… 

[He shouts loudly.]

Jin: Lady Masako! Warriors of Clan Adachi! Is anyone here?

[However, no one responds. Jin begins to investigate the manor and discovers obvious signs of a struggle.]

Jin: Someone forced their way in. A naginata. Used by the women of clan Adachi… They fought to defend their family. They were trying to escape. Passed the children through the window.

[Several bandits jump out of one of the houses.]

Bandit: Kill him!

[Jin easily defeats them.]

Jin: Where is Lady Masako? Tell me where she is. Who were these men? Not Mongols… and not bandits. I need to find out what happened here… If anyone survived, they may have fled on horseback. Better check the stables… Empty stables. Someone took the horses… Horse tracks. Someone fled the estate… They left a trail… Footprints. The rider was being chased. Archers were hunting the rider. The rider was skilled knew how to confuse their aim. A fallen horse… This horse belonged to clan Adachi. Dead for days… 

[Suddenly an arrow flies at him, but Jin repels it with a deft sword blow.]

Jin: Lady Masako. It's me.

Masako: Jin Sakai… They said no samurai escaped Komoda. My husband?

Jin: Lord Adachi died a warrior's death… Defending our home.

Masako: Our home… Why have you come?

Jin: The Mongol Khan has captured Lord Shimura. If your clan joins me… We can save my uncle… And avenge your men.

Masako: Clan Adachi… Is dead. Massacred by our own people.

Jin: Traitors. Why would they kill those who swore to protect them?

Masako: I intend to find out.

Jin: I'm coming with you.

Masako: No. Do not set aside your concerns for mine.

Jin: The family of samurai are my concern. I know what it means to be the last of one's clan.

Masako: I cannot be responsible for your death.

Jin: You won't be.

Masako: Ride with me.

[They get on their horses and gallop down the forest path.]

Jin: I sought men at your estate. 

Masako: They were waiting to finish what they started. The night my husband and sons rode to face the Mongols… the assassins came to our home. My sister took the children and fled. I stayed with my sons' wives to fight our attackers. We were outnumbered. And then I was the only one left.

Jin: That's how it ended for me at Komoda.

Masako: (crying) For me, it wasn't over. I buried them here. With the rest of our family. I tried to save them. But the assassins caught them on the road. Cut them down. My sister. My grandchildren. Even little Natsu. She was just born. All I could do was bury her with her mother.

Jin: This never should have happened.

Masako: My sister should have been buried with her husband, in the north. But at least she is with family. Come. We ride for the Golden Temple.

Jin: I'm sorry you endured this alone.

Masako: I am not alone. The killers are alive.

Jin: They will pay for what they did.

Masako: Every moment the killers walk free… brings me shame.

Jin: You can't blame yourself.

Masako: But it is my duty to punish them for it.

[They ride up to the temple.]

Masako: You'll have to go in without me. Find the monk named Sogen, and tell him the fate of clan Adachi.

Jin: What are you plotting, Lady Masako?

Masako: Indulge a grieving widow. Once you've talked to Sogen, find the armorer. She's repairing something for me. I want you to have it.

Jin: I will do that. Thank you.

Masako: I'll wait for you on the other side of the temple.

[Jin enters the temple. A monk meets him at the threshold.]

Jinshin: Lord Sekai. It is an honor.

Jin: Are you in charge here?

Junshin: I think of myself as more of a servant, my lord. Please… call me Junshin. I made this temple a haven for our people.

Jin: I'll spread the word.

Junshin: If they cannot make the journey, there are also camps around Ariake. I supply them with all the food I can spare.

Jin: That's good to know. I'm looking for one of your fellow monks. A man named Sogen.

Junshin: I believe he is sweeping the temple deck.

Jin: Thank you, Jumshin. Continue your good work.

Peasant: Are you hunting for Shigenori's Heavenly Strike as well, my lord?

Jin: That technique is only one of myth.

Peasant: The musician Yamato insists the myth is real.

Jin: I'm not surprised. People often speak of his stories with excitement.

Peasant: I heard the tale near Komatsu Forge. If it's as powerful as the story claims… let's hope you never face the technique in battle.

[Jin manages to find the monk Lady Masako asked him to find.]

Jin: Are you Sogen? 

Sogen: I am.

Jin: I am Sakai.

Sogen: A samurai. Alive?

Jin: I have a message from Lady Masako. Clan Adachi was attacked. She is the only survivor.

Sogen: The Mongols.

Jin: Traitors. Our own people.

Sogen: How horrible.

Jin: Has anyone suspicious passed through the temple? A group of armed men?

Sogen: Not that I've seen—but… my duties keep me far too busy. Please tell Lady Masako she's welcome to take refuge here.

Jin: Thank you for your time.

Sogen: Of course.

Jin: (to himself) I need to find the armorer.

Armorer: Allow me to strengthen your armor, my lord.

Jin: Lady Masako sent me. Said you were repairing something she wanted me to have.

Armorer: The armor. It's one of the finest sets I've ever worked with. Let me get it…

[She brings the samurai armor and Jin puts it on.]

Armorer: It suits you perfectly, my lord. The quality is incomparable. It will serve you well. But if anything isn't to your liking… I can always make alterations. All I need are the right materials.

Jin: Thank you.

Armorer: I'll do my best to make you strong and secure. This will protect you.

[Jin returns to Masako.]

Masako: You got the armor. 

Jin: It fits well. 

Masako: It belonged to my eldest, Shigesato.

Jin: It is an honor. I spoke to the monk.

Masako: What did Sogen say?

Jin: He offers you refuge in the temple.

Masako: So my family's killers know where to find me. We need to move.

Jin: You think Sogen is behind the massacre?

Masako: He visited my home just before the assassins. The little bastard was their scout.

Jin: That doesn't prove his guilt.

Masako: No. But it earns my suspicion. Sogen arrived from Kamiagata at the beginning of the autumn.

Jin: When we first heard the Mongols planned to invade…

Masako: The plot to destroy my clan took precision. Planning.

Jin: And a war to cover the treachery.

[They come to a small hill that overlooks the temple.]

Masako: Where is that monk? 

Jin: There's Sogen. Leaving in a hurry.

Masako: Let's follow the wolf to his den.

Peasant: (from afar) Master Sogen, where can we go for food?

Sogen: (from afar) I don’t know.

Peasant: (from afar) Please, we’re very hangry.

Sogen: (from afar) It is not your hunger, but your attachment to food which makes you suffer.

Peasant: (from afar) But we haven't eaten in days…

Sogen: (from afar) Ask Master Junshin.

Masako: We can get down here.

[They quietly follow Sogen.]

Jin: You sent me to frighten the monk. 

Masako: I knew he would panic. Make a mistake. Now he's leading us to his friends.

Sogen: (from afar) Damn peasants... Thought they'd never leave me alone.

Jin: Stay close. We can't be seen.

Sogen: (from afar) I wonder if anyone saw me leave...

Jin: Hide.

Masako: Did he see us?

Jin: I don't think so. He's moving again.

Masako: Let's go.

Sogen: What's that? Just deer.

Jin: (to Masako) Get out of sight.

Masako: The old inn.

Jin: Let's get closer.

Masako: This way.

[They hide to eavesdrop on the conversation.]

Sogen: Masako's alive. She has a samurai with her!

Bandit: That must be who killed our men at the estate.

Sogen: You fools! Now they know I'm part of this. You have to find them.

Bandit: Keep your voice down.

Sogen: I'm going inside. Don't come back until they're dead.

Masako: Those men slaughtered my family. Spare the monk. The rest can die.

Jin: (comes out to the bandits) Draw your blades! Who will face me first?

[He kills the first bandit who attacks him. Ledy Masako does the same.]

Masako: For Clan Adachi!

[They finish off the rest of the bandits.]

Masako: Sogen went inside the inn. Let's go. There's nowhere to run, Sogen.

[They cornered the monk.]

Jin: You destroyed Clan Adachi.

Sogen: I was only a messenger.

Masako: For who?

Sogen: Knowledge does not end suffering.

Masako: You know nothing of suffering.

Jin: Masako....

Masako: I buried my family… one by one. It took days. But I'm going to leave you… for the wolves.

Jin: We need him alive-to tell us who he serves.

Sogen: Our world has changed. Men of vision must rise to face it. And those in the way… Must be removed.

Masako: (screams) They were children!

[She draws her katana and strikes Sogen a few times with tears on her face.]

Jin: Masako—

Masako: He was never going to talk.

Jin: We still need information. There has to be something we can use. Search outside. I'll deal with things in here.

Masako: Find me when you're done.

[Jin searches the place.]

Jin: They've run out of food. Must have been here awhile. Spare weapons. They expected reinforcements. Payment for slaughtering children… Is that all their lives were worth? Hmm. Names... and a symbol. Masako might know them...

Masako: Did you find anything?

Jin: A list of names and a clan symbol.

Masako: I found the same symbol on these men. I've never seen it before.

Jin: A rival clan… moving in to take control. We have to stop them.

Masako: I will.

Jin: You can not do it alone. When my uncle hears of this… he will not rest until the traitors pay for what they did. Help me… and we will bring down everyone who hurt you.

Masako: Together. When you need help rescuing your uncle… I will be there.

Jin: Thank you, Lady Masako.

Masako: Until that time, I have work to do.

[“The Tale of Lady Masako” completed.]
