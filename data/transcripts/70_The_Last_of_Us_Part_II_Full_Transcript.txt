Be sure to refresh in memory the first game beautifully scripted by Shotgunnova.

 JACKSON 
[Joel sits in an old, ragged chair and wipes a metal butterfly on a guitar fingerboard. He talks to someone who is behind the scenes.]

Joel: I don’t know what happened. I was supposed to take her to the Fireflies and walk away. You go halfway across the country with someone... She needed her immunity to mean somethin’. Maybe I was starting to buy into that whole... cure business. Maybe I just wanted to do right by her. And then we made it. We found the Fireflies. And because of her... They were actually going to make a cure. The only catch... it would kill her.

[We jump to the events of the first game. Joel bursts into the operating room. The surgeon grabs the scalpel from the stand and threatens him.]

Joel: Sweet Jesus.

Nurse: Doctor?

Surgeon: What are you doing in here? I won’t let you take her. This is our future, think of all the lives we’ll save.

[We return to the present. The man who is sitting opposite Joel is Tommy.]

Tommy: Jesus Christ, Joel. What’d you do?

Joel: I saved her.

[We see the footage of a bloody hospital. There are many corpses everywhere.]

Joel: C’mon, baby girl. I gotcha. I gotcha.

[The siren is turned on.]

Firefly: (via speaker) Cover the exits! Don’t let him get away!

Joel: Oh shit.

[Joel grabs Ellie on a smoke and runs out of the operating room. We go back to the present.]

Tommy: Goddamn. That’s... That’s a lot. What does Ellie know?

Joel: I told her they just ran some tests. I told her... her immunity meant nothin’.

Tommy: And she believed you?

Joel: Didn’t say otherwise.

Tommy: We should head back.

[Tommy takes the jacket and leaves. Joel takes his guitar, backpack, and leaves the room too. They manually lift the garage door and ride out on horseback. Sad guitar music is played.]

Tommy: Hiya!

Joel: Hiya!

[For some time, they ride silently.]

Tommy: Go on...

Joel: You got it.

Tommy: Almost there.

Joel: Yep.

Tommy: Hey! It’s us!

[They enter an enclosed settlement. Joel gets off his horse.]

Joel: C’mon.

Tommy: It’s okay, I got ‘em. You go on.

Joel: You sure?

Tommy: Yeah.

Joel: All right.

Tommy: About what we were talkin’ about earlier... I can’t say I’d’ve done different. I’ll take it to the grave, if I have to.

Joel: I’ll see you later, Tommy.

[Night. Ellie listens to music in her headphones and draws in her notebook. Joel comes in.]

Joel: Hello? Ellie?

Ellie: Jesus. You almost gave me a heart attack.

Joel: I tried knocking, but...

Ellie: Hey.

Joel: Hey.

Ellie: What’s up, Joel?

Joel: Just checking in. Folks are... y’know, talking about how impressed they are with you and how well, you’re helping out.

Ellie: That’s good.

Joel: Yeah. Tommy and I went out riding the other day and he, uh... he told me a joke and I thought about you, it’s, um... Oh shoot, now I forgot it, uh... It was somethin’ about a clock... how do you--

Ellie: Joel. It’s, uh, it’s pretty late, and I gotta get up in a few hours--

Joel: Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, and I’m gonna get out of your hair, I just, um... I wanna show you somethin’. Just gimme one second.

[He leaves the room. Ellie sighs.]

Ellie: What’s this?

[Joel brings the guitar.]

Joel: Some folks call this thing here a gee-tar.

Ellie: Funny.

Joel: Do you wanna hear something?

Ellie: Okay.

Joel: Okay. Promise me that you won’t laugh.

Ellie: I won’t laugh. I won’t.

Joel: I’m trustin’ you...

[He takes a deep breath and tries to play.]

Joel: (singing)
If I ever were to lose you
I’d surely lose myself
Everything I have found here
I’ve not found by myself
Try and sometimes you’ll succeed
To make this man of me
All my stolen missing parts
I’ve no need for anymore
’Cause I believe
And I believe ‘cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me.

Joel: There you go.

Ellie: Well... that didn’t suck.

Joel: (laughs) I’ll take what I can get. She’s yours.

Ellie: No. No, no, no. I don’t know the first thing about this.

Joel: I promised that I’d teach you how to play.

Ellie: You did.

Joel: So what do you say, tomorrow night, first lesson?

Ellie: Deal.

Joel: Okay. Okay.

Ellie: Did... Did you remember the joke?

Joel: Um... What is the downside to eating a clock? It’s time consuming.

Ellie: (smiles) That’s so dumb.

Joel: Yeah. G’night, kiddo.

[He goes away and closes the door behind him. Ellie taps the strings.]

 4 YEARS LATER 
[Ellie wakes up with a knock on the door.]

Ellie: Oh, shit. Fuck.

[She opens the door.]

Ellie: Hey.

Jesse: Morning!

Ellie: Sorry. I totally overslept. Just give me a minute, and I’ll get dressed.

Jesse: I heard you had quite a night after I left.

Ellie: I... She kissed me. It was just Dina being Dina. She didn’t mean anything by it.

Jesse: I was talking about your fight with Seth. Wait... you kissed Dina?

Ellie: Oh. I thought that’s--

Jesse: We’re broken up one week and you make a move on my girl?

Ellie: No... She was probably just trying to make you jealous. I didn’t... I would never... Oh, fuck, this is awkward.

Jesse: I’m messing with you, man. I don’t care. Get dressed.

Ellie: You’re the worst.

[She wants to close the door, but Jesse stops her.]

Jesse: It’s kind of fucked up you did that.

Ellie: (scoffs)

[She closes the door. Jesse speaks from behind the door.]

Jesse: Get your stuff together, we’re already late!

Ellie: Smells fine. Ugh. So tired... ‘Kay. (puts on a jacket and takes the gun) Eh, sure.

Ellie: Hey, is Joel up?

Jesse: (behind the door) We got reports of infected out north. Maria sent him and Tommy out early to scout.

Ellie: That sucks.

Jesse: Yep. Can’t imagine they got much sleep. Definitely not as much as you.

Ellie: Shut up. I was just about to get up.

Jesse: Mm-hmm.

Ellie: I was.

[She goes out of the house.]

Jesse: You got everything?

Ellie: Yes.

[They are going somewhere. It is quite cold outside. There is a thin layer of snow everywhere.]

Jesse: Heads up, you’re the talk of the town this morning.

Ellie: Ugh. What?

Jesse: Let me see if I got this right: you kissed Dina -

Ellie: She kissed me.

Jesse: Which triggered Seth to call you a... not-so-nice word...

Ellie: Yep.

Jesse: Then Joel decked him--

Ellie: More of a push.

Jesse: And then you got mad at Joel? That part confused me.

Ellie: It was a strange night. man.

Jesse: Sounds exciting. Maria wants a word with you.

Ellie: Where is she?

Jesse: The diner.

Ellie: Is this about Seth?

Jesse: No clue.

Ellie: Just tell her you never saw me.

Jesse: Nope.

Ellie: Where’s your fucking loyalty?

Jesse: Excuse me?

Ellie: Hey, so... We’re okay, right?

Jesse: You and me? Yeah, of course. Dina and I are done.

Ellie: I know. I just didn’t want you to think--

Jesse: Ellie, we’re cool. Promise.

Ellie: Thanks.

[They continue to walk silently for some time. Ellie notices a dog.]

Ellie: Hey, old timer. Yeah, get a good scratch.

Woman: Hey Jesse.

Jesse: Oh, hi.

[Ellie and Jesse enter the diner.]

Jesse: Want to grab some breakfast?

Ellie: No. Where’s Maria?

Jesse: In the back.

[A lot of people gathered at the diner. Ellie walks through the crowd.]

Ellie: Excuse me.

Maria: Ellie! There you are. C’mere. Seth’s got something he wants to say to you--

Ellie: I don’t want to hear what that bigot has to say.

Maria: Do it for me. Please.

Ellie: Fine.

Maria: Seth! Seth, c’mere.

Ellie: Fuck me.

Seth: Hey. Look, last night... I was drinking too much.

Ellie: Sure.

Seth: I’m trying to say I’m sorry. Maria tells me that you and Dina are headed out. I, uh, made you some sandwiches.

Ellie: Okay.

Seth: They’re steak.

Maria: Thank you, Seth.

Seth: Yeah. Well, uh... You be safe out there.

Ellie: Yup.

[Seth goes to the back room.]

Maria: I appreciate that.

Jesse: What you got there?

Ellie: Bigot sandwiches.

Jesse: Mm. Smells good.

Ellie: They’re yours.

Jesse: You sure?

Ellie: It’s fine.

Maria: Let me walk you out.

Jesse: Okay.

[They leave the diner.]

Maria: When you go out, I want you to trade off with Tommy and Joel. Those boys have been up for far too long.

Jesse: Where do I meet them?

Maria: If you go up to the northwest Lookout, they’re scheduled to arrive later today. Watch yourself. I mean, there’s too many sightings of infected recently.

Jesse: Of course. I was gonna check out the creek trails. I’ll need someone else to cover it.

Maria: Ellie... You know the creek trails?

Ellie: Not really

Jesse: Dina’s done it a bunch. I’ll have the two of them take it.

Maria: That solves that. Ellie, can I talk to you for a sec?

Ellie: ‘Sup?

Maria: Look, I don’t know what’s going on with you and Joel...

Ellie: Maria.

Ellie: Maria. Maria: The guy really cares about you.

Maria: The guy really cares about you. And I’m sure he didn’t mean to--

Ellie: We’re fine.

Maria: Yeah?

Maria: Yeah?

Ellie: Yeah.

Maria: Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry to pry. Be safe.

Ellie: Thanks.

Jesse: Yo, Dina, assignments!

Dina: Just gimme a minute!

Jesse: (to Ellie) Will you get your girlfriend to the stables please?

[Dina plays snowball with some boys.]

Ellie: Oh my god. Hey, Dina! Can I talk to you?

Dina: Hey, guys? I’m tapping out!

Kid: Come on! For how long?

Dina: Hoo! (to Ellie) Hey.

Ellie: Hey. Um, I just wanted to say sorry for running off last night.

Dina: Oh, that’s-- it’s okay. I totally get it. I just, I felt bad.

Ellie: Why?

Dina: ‘Cause I started the whole thing. I just, I shouldn’t have kissed you in front of all of those people and I--

Ellie: You were drunk. It’s fine.

Dina: Well, still. I don’t want you to think--

Ellie: No, I’m not reading into it or anything.

Dina: You know what I love about you? How you let me finish my sentences.

Ellie: All right... Well, we should get probably get going.

Dina: Yeah.

[One of the boys throws a snowball at Ellie’s shoulder.]

Ellie: Ow!

Dina: What the fuck?

Ellie: I’m not even playing!

Kid: ‘Cause you’re a chicken? Ha ha! You’re a chicken!

Ellie: I hate this kid so much.

Dina: You want to fuck him up?

Ellie: Yeah, I do.

Dina: You asked for it!

Ellie: You better run, you little shits!

Kid: Holy shit, get to cover! Go, go!

[A fun game of snowballs begins. In the background plays frolicsome country music.]

Ellie: Gotcha!

Ellie: Eat that!

Kid: No!

Kid: Aww, dang it!

Dina: I’m coming for you, tiny!

Ellie: Ow!

Dina: Fuck yeah! I mean frick. Don’t tell your mom.

Ellie: Damn. The arm on that kid.

Dina: I see you.

Kid: No!

Kid: Ugh!

Dina: Oh, you better hide!

Dina: Boom, eat snow you little shit! We’re winning!

Ellie: Eat snow!

Dina: Your parents don’t love you!

Kid: I got her!

Ellie: I see you! Ha!

Dina: Oh, what a shot! C’mon!

Ellie: Ow! Who taught you that? Ow! Oh man, that got in my shirt!

Kid: No fair!

Dina: Gotcha!

Kid: You can’t get me! No fair!

[Dina and Ellie win the game.]

Dina: Eat it, shrimps!

Kid: Hey!

Dina: Eat it, shrimps!

Kid: Hey!

Dina: How’s it feel? Noo!

[Children jump on her and drop into the snow.]

Kid: Get her!

Dina: Help me! You’ll never get away with this!

Kid: Get off, get off!

Ellie: Get off of her, you monsters!

Ellie: All right! All right, we actually have some work to do.

Kid: Aww!

Kid: Aww man!

Ellie: Scram!

Dina: I guess I asked for that, huh?

Ellie: Yep.

[Ellie and Dina are leaving.]

Ellie: So. Jesse wants us to do the creek trails. He’s gonna relieve Joel and Tommy.

Dina: Oh. It’s nice he assigned us together. You’re gonna like this route.

[They go to the stables.]

Man: Morning, girls.

Dina: Morning!

Man: Hey ladies! I’ll bring ‘em in.

Dina: Thank you!

[Ellie comes to the horse, which was prepared for her by a stable boy.]

Man: (to the horse) That’s a good girl. Look who’s here!

Ellie: Thanks. Come on.

Dina: All right.

[They take the horses out of the stables.]

Ellie: (to her horse) Hey, Shimmer.

Jesse: Ahh! Look who decided to join us.

Ellie: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[He brought two rifles.]

Jesse: One for you. And one for you. (towards the gates) Open it up! Settle down, children. All right. You all know the drill. Run your routes. Mark your logbooks. Clear any infected you see, You run into anything you can’t handle, you come back. Be smart about it. All right, get goin’.

[Ellie and Dean are saddling horses and leave the settlement. They ride towards the snow-covered mountains.]

Dina: (cheek click)

Ellie: Hyah!

[Meanwhile, several people sleep in sleeping bags in a forest hut. One of them, a girl, wakes up sharply as if she had a nightmare. She gets out of the sleeping bag and goes to the man standing by the window.]

Woman: Hey.

Man: Hi. What were you dreaming about?

Woman: Was I talking?

Man: You were doing your teeth grinding thing.

Woman: Where’ve you been?

Man: Grab your gear. I wanna show you something.

Woman: What?

Man: Trust me.

[She gets dressed and they go out through the garage door.]

Man: Come on. This way.

Woman: Oof, it’s cold. You sure you don’t wanna do this when the sun’s out? And it’s warmer?

Man: No... Can’t wait.

Woman: And you don’t want to just tell me?

Man: You need to see it.

Woman: What are you doing wandering around out here by yourself?

Man: Been restless.

Woman: You too?

Man: Feel like the farther south we go, the prettier it’s gotten.

Woman: You wanna keep going? Just drive all the way to Mexico?

Man: I’ve thought about it. Yeah, I don’t see that living up to his stories somehow.

Woman: Yeah, no, probably not. You did all this in the dark?

Man: Yes. Now c’mon.

Woman: We keep going like this, we’re going to be tired for today’s trip.

Man: It’s not that far.

Woman: Hey, is Mel okay? She’s seemed out of it these past few days.

Man: She’ll be fine.

Woman: Stop being weird, you’re freaking me out.

Man: I’m not being weird.

Woman: Are you breaking up with Mel?

Man: What? No. You wish.

Woman: Uh, I’ve had my fill, thank you.

Man: Ouch.

Woman: We can’t all be as graceful as you.

Man: Clearly.

[The mountain path makes a steep turn with a cliff. A man and a woman will walk along the very edge.]

Woman: What is that?

Man: You’ll be fine.

Woman: It’s too high.

Man: C’mon.

[The woman slips but not falls. Part of the cliff collapses.]

Woman: Shit!

Man: Hey! Eyes on me. Abby! Stop looking down.

Abby: Owen... Do we have to go back this way?

Owen: Consider it an opportunity to work on your fears.

Abby: How about I work my foot up your ass?

Owen: Abby. Stop flirting.

[Abby smirks. They climb a mountain from which there is a view of a large settlement.]

Abby: Is this it?

Owen: We made it.

Abby: Holy shit. It’s a fucking city.

Owen: Yeah.

Abby: Have you told anyone else?

Owen: Wanted you to see it first. I saw an armed patrol go from town to an outpost over there. Few more outposts in between. They have electricity, guns... It’s a lot of people.

Abby: We can figure it out.

Owen: Okay. Assuming he’s in there, how do we get to him?

Abby: We can corner one of the patrols and get confirmation and then, I dunno, maybe find a way to lure him out.

Owen: Yeah, okay, I’m sure they’ll be happy to offer that information up.

Abby: Well, then we make them.

Owen: Do you hear yourself?

Abby: Okay, what do you want to do? What is going on with you?

Owen: Mel’s pregnant.

Abby: Oh... Okay.

Owen: It’s not just that, though.

Abby: Should I say congrats?

Owen: When everyone else sees this, they’re gonna want to turn back.

Abby: We can convince them. Right? I fucking knew I couldn’t count on you.

Owen: Abby. I want what you want, but not at any cost. Hey--

Abby: Don’t!

Owen: I’ll see you back at the lodge.

[He leaves. Owen’s words make Abby very upset. She barely holds back her tears.]

Abby: Fuck it. I don’t give a fuck... I’ll do the whole thing on my own.

[She goes towards a small hut on the edge of the mountains.]

Abby: Oof... He got Mel pregnant... Shit.

[On the way she finds several corpses covered with snow. Abby pulls out a gun.]

Abby: You alive?

[Abby makes her way down the narrow aisle in the mountain. She stumbles upon a frozen corpse and tries to push it out.]

Abby: Oh shit! Move.

[When she gets out of the aisle, a dead man hiding in the snow grabs her leg.]

Abby: Ahh! No! Get off!

[There is a fast but very intense fight. The dead man turns out to be very fast - he grabs Abby, presses her against a tree and makes many quick blows with his hands. They fall into a small fissure. Abby has to fight for her life with her bare hands. In the end, Abby pushes the dead man into the snow and splits his head open with a few strong blows. The fuss awakens the rest of the dead and Abby has to run.]

Abby: Fuck... my shoulder...

[She hides in a small and long abandoned hut.]

Abby: How do I get out of here?

[She decides that the best way out of the hut is to crawl under the floor.]

Abby: This is a bad idea, Abby...

[The dead are already crawling after her.]

Abby: Oh shit.

[Abby pulls out a gun. Getting out of the hut, she goes on. It goes through an abandoned mountain town. There are a lot of dead people around, which Abby has to kill with her bare hands.]

Abby: Where’s that lookout? Okay... It’s gotta be close... There. That’s how you do it… Fuck, I’m so lost... Shit. Fuck. Please let that be it... Weather’s getting bad... Where’s the road? Horse tracks. Where’s the patrol?

[We go back to Ellie and Dina.]

Ellie: Do you miss being with him?

Dina: With Jesse? No.

Ellie: You’ve been together for so long.

Dina: Look. Jesse’s great. I love his parents. They will always be family, but we were just on autopilot.

Ellie: Hey, how come we never talked about this stuff?

Dina: I don’t know. It didn’t feel... You never really talked to me about Cat.

Ellie: Yeah, ‘cause there isn’t much to talk about

Dina: Yeow...

Ellie: I just... I got the impression that you didn’t really like her.

Dina: I don’t care about her one way or the other.

Ellie: (smiles) Okay...

Dina: I think she’s a talented artist. I’ve grown to like that tattoo of yours.

Ellie: That’s so big of you.

Dina: And I think she wasn’t right for you.

Ellie: Interesting.

Dina: Shut up

Ellie: Okay!

Dina: You can tie Shimmer up here.

[They get off the horses and tie them up in one of the half-destroyed buildings.]

Dina: Hey. You wanna see something spectacular?

Ellie: You’re going to point at your face, aren’t you?

Dina: Nothing is that spectacular.

Ellie: Oh, brother.

Dina: Come on, stupid.

[They overlook the balcony, which offers a beautiful view of the mountains.]

Dina: What do you think of this view, huh?

Ellie: It’s pretty nice.

Dina: Yeah, this route has its perks.

Ellie: Where do we sign in?

Dina: Come on.

Ellie: (silently) Fuck.

[They continue to explore.]

Ellie: Who’d you used to do this route with? Jesse?

Dina: Eugene.

Ellie: Right. Aww, Eugene. Man, he was funny.

Dina: Oh yeah. Plus, he taught me about rewiring electronics and stuff. May we all be that sharp at seventy-three.

Ellie: May we all make it to seventy-three.

Dina: Through here.

[They climb the rope to the second floor.]

Dina: Sign us in.

Ellie: What was this place?

Dina: Used to be a radio tower.

[Ellie makes an entry in a big journal, which is already full of records.]

Ellie: And there.

Dina: C’mere. Town up ahead’s our last stop. Take a look.

[She gives Ellie binoculars.]

Ellie: There’s the town. With the big tower thing?

Dina: Yup, that’s where the next lookout is.

Ellie: Oh. There’s the ski lodge. That’s the one on Tommy and Joel’s route.

Dina: That’s the one.

Ellie: That a supermarket?

Dina: Yeah. We’ll pass that on our way into town. Let’s get back to the horses. Question: Were you wearing those same clothes yesterday?

Ellie: They’re clean!

Dina: (laughs) No judgement.

Ellie: It’s patrol, you know. We’re here to kill infected, not to look fancy.

Dina: Still look nice.

Ellie: Ugh... Thank you...?

Dina: C’mon.

[They will saddle the horses again and ride on.]

Ellie: I think we should go out like Eugene.

Dina: From a stroke?

Ellie: No. From old age... Living a long life.

Dina: You? No way. c’mon. You’re way too reckless.

Ellie: Look who’s talking!

Dina: You’ll probably die from hypothermia from wearing canvas sneakers in the show!

Ellie: I am wearing boots today! You know how you’re going to die?

Dina: Let me guess... you’re gonna kill me? Ha! Did I ruin your punchline?

Ellie: No! Maybe! Fuck you!

Dina: Hmm, sorry.

Ellie: Hey, should we check these houses out?

Dina: Seems quiet. But we can, if you want. I bet they still got supplies.

Ellile: What do you know about this place?

Dina: Just another evacuated neighborhood. Infected almost never make it out this far. We usually catch them on the outer perimeter. What are you doing tonight?

Ellie: Uh.... I was thinking of inviting Joel to watch a movie.

Dina: Oh... You guys good?

Ellie: Yeah.

Dina: What movie are you guys going to watch? What’s Joel into?

Ellie: Uhh.... Curtis and Viper 2. That’s the one that’s been on my radar for a while.

Dina: Oh. Wow.

Ellie: We used to watch these cheesy 80s action movies. He’s really into them.

Dina: Oh no....

Ellie: I actually really like them too. What about you? What are you doing later?

Dina: Some people were talking about sneaking out. Going sledding.

Ellie: That sounds fun.

Dina: Yeah. You want to meet up after?

Ellie: Uhh... okay... Maybe I’ll play guitar for you.

Dina: Okay. What’s Curtis and Viper 2 about?

Ellie: Okay, so, two former commandos that go rogue to fight bad guys. And I think in this one they go up against Russian spies or something.

Dina: I’m more interested in this than I thought I would be.

[Ellie finds a collection card with the superhero Tesseracter.]

Ellie: Ooh, I don’t have this one.

Dina: Isn’t it one of those superhero cards you’re all into?

Ellie: Oh, yeah.

Dina: You think anybody out there is still making movies?

Ellie: Has to be.

Dina: How do you know? I mean, what if they’re all just like us? Just surviving day to day?

Ellie: Well, I write new music, so... If someone had a camera--

Dina: Wait, hold up. There are original Ellie songs? Why haven’t you played any for me?

Ellie: I... I don’t know.

Dina: Come on. Will you play one for me tonight?

Ellie: Mmm. I’ll think about it. These trailers are neat. Nice little... portable home.

Dina: You think people really traveled a lot in these things?

Ellie: Wouldn’t you?

Dina: I mean, if I lived pre-outbreak, yeah! I’d go see the whole country.

Ellie: Or travel to another country!

Dina: Maybe one day we will.

Ellie: Keep dreaming.

Dina: Jesse talked a lot about going to Canada. He said there’s these. Like, giant waterfalls out there he wanted to see.

Ellie: Really? He’s such a hardcore Jackson guy. Fuck. I think the temperature dropped.

[Ellie sees a few bloodstains on the snow up ahead.]

Ellie: Whoa, easy girl. Holy shit.

Dina: What the fuck? Ugh, that smell.

Ellie: Looks like infected did this.

Dina: How many you think it would take to bring down a moose?

Ellie: More than one. Where the hell are they?

Dina: Let’s go find them.

[They go to a large house away from the corpse of an elk. From there, someone screams and groans.]

Dina: Shit. I hear some inside. How the fuck did they get in there?

Ellie: More importantly, how do we get in there?

Dina: This way. Runner.

[Ellie comes to the dead man from behind and cuts its throat.]

Ellie: It’s down.

Dina: That’s one. Let’s see if we can get around to the back of the supermarket.

[Sneaking through the rubble Ellie accidentally drops the closet, which attracts the attention of the dead man.]

Ellie: Oh, shit!

[He runs on it. Ellie throws a bottle in his face and stuck a knife under his ribs.]

Dina: You good?

Ellie: Yeah.

Dina: Nice throw, by the way.

Ellie: Thanks.

Dina: The way we came in was barricaded… How’d that runner get in here?

Ellie: Yeah, that’s a good question.

Dina: What’s the most infected you’ve ever taken down on patrol?

Ellie: It’s gotta be the one I had with Joel a year or so ago. It was like, I dunno, a dozen. You?

Dina: Cleared about twenty once. There was a group passing through.

Ellie: Fuck... Maybe we’ll get you a new personal record today.

Dina: Ellie. More blood.

Ellie: Dina. This way.

[They get out of the supermarket through a window.]

Ellie: More runners.

Dina: Let’s keep it quiet.

Ellie: Let’s see how it goes. Fuck, watch out!

Dina: That all of them?

Ellie: Yeah. Looks like it.

Dina: We’ve still gotta get the ones in the supermarket.

Ellie: Let’s keep circling the building. Gotta be a way in.

Dina: Ellie. Help me up there? I wanna look around.

Ellie: All right, go ahead.

[She helps Dina get on the truck.]

Dina: Um, there’s a hole in the roof over there. Here.

[Dina helps Ellie to climb on the truck.]

Ellie: Thanks.

Dina: Look. See?

Ellie: All right, let’s figure out how to get in there. Dina. Under here. Ahh!

Dina: Ellie!

[A dead man jumps on Ellie. Deena runs up and kills it.]

Dina: Ellie, are you clean?

Ellie: Yeah. Just banged up.

Dina: Please die of old age and not because you get infected. I really don’t want to have to shoot you in the face.

Ellie: Deal.

Dina: Cool. Anything good back there?

Ellie: Actually yeah…

[She picks up some drugs.]

Dina: Nice.

Ellie: See any way to that roof?

Dina: Uhh... not sure.

Ellie: This way. I’m in! Hey! Got some alcohol.

Dina: Couple of rags. Here. Fix yourself up.

Dina: I see spores in there. Masks on.

Ellie: Got it.

Dina: Remember. I don’t want to have to shoot you in the face.

Ellie: Aw. That’s so sweet. All these spores mean they’ve been here for a while. Keep your eyes peeled for older infected.

Dina: Yep. Is this part of the supermarket?

Ellie: I don’t know. I think we’re above it?

Dina: Let’s get to the ground floor…

[They have been searching the spore-infected area for some time. Stepping on a loose section of the floor, Ellie fails under it.]

Ellie: Oh, shit.

Dina: Ellie!

Ellie: Ahh!

[They both fall into the basement. They are attacked by Clicker and Deena has to protect Ellie. She blows Clicker’s head with a few precise shots.]

Ellie: Holy fuck!

Dina: Come on.

Ellie: Shh, shh. Fucking clickers.

[The supermarket is filled with Clickers.]

Dina: Here we go. Keep it extra quiet.

[They move very carefully around the supermarket. There are eerie clicks everywhere.]

Ellie: Those blind motherfuckers make my skin crawl...

Dina: Let’s make sure the rest of the building’s cleared out. And then get the fuck out of here.

Ellie: Speaking my language.

[She wants to move a large closet that has blocked the door.]

Ellie: Dina. A little help?

Dina: Coming.

[They leave the trading hall and continue to explore the area contaminated by the spores.]

Dina: I’ll make you a present.

Ellie: I’ll take a present.

Dina: Ellie. Here.

Ellie: Thanks.

[She give her a Molotov.]

Dina: Careful with that.

Ellie: I’m a pro.

[They hear the voices of the dead.]

Ellie: We’re not done. We got some numbers here.

[They are beginning to clean up a large hall with various dead people.]

Dina: What do you think? Hit the runners first?

Ellie: Let’s see...

Dina: There’s a runner. On the left.

Ellie: Heads up! Watch out! Any still moving?

Dina: Uh... nope. You know what? I’m impressed with us. Okay. Let’s go to the next lookout and take a fucking break. We earned it.

Ellie: Agreed.

Dina: You see a way out?

Ellie: It won’t budge.

Dina: Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. You’re just gonna hurt me up through that hole in the roof.

Ellie: ‘Kay. Cable here! Here we go. Yep. That should hold us.

[She throws the cable on the roof, but it falls off.]

Dina: Want me to try?

Ellie: I got it. Get over! Fuck yeah.

Dina: Okay, that’s good. Here I go.

[They climb to the roof.]

Dina: Careful when you get up here! It’s pretty windy! Over here! Storm’s really picked up!

[They jump outside and go to the horses. A snowstorm begins to blow.]

Ellie: How far are we from the lookout?

Dina: It’s just past the next town.

Ellie: Following you.

[Ellie and Dina saddle the horses.]

Ellie: Hey, how far away are we?

Dina: A few minutes out!

Ellie: Okay. This is getting worse! Should we turn back?

Dina: We won’t make it! We’re almost there!

Ellie: (to her horse) I know, girl. I know. Keep going. Dina, how much further? Dina? Dina! Shit. Dina! Where are you! Dina! Fuck. Fuck! Dina!

Dina: Ellie!

Ellie: Dina!

Dina: Ellie! I can see you!

Ellie: Where are you?

Dina: Ellie!

Dina: Come on! This way!

Ellie: Where are we going?

Dina: Just trust me.

[They ride into a library.]

Dina: Get inside! I’ll get the door.

Ellie: You been here?

Dina: Rode by it. Never came inside.

Ellie: All right. Let’s make sure it’s clear. Someone’s locked this place up. There’s something back there. I think I see a bed.

Dina: Think we got a squatter?

Ellie: You see another way in?

Dina: Doesn’t feel like anyone’s been here in a while.

[Ellie finds a little workshop, but the door to it is closed.]

Ellie: Shit. I gotta see what’s back there.

[She breaks the glass with the knife handle.]

Ellie: What’s going on here?

Dina: All this electronic stuff... This has to be Eugene’s.

Ellie: Are you sure?

Dina: Yeah! Nobody else would tinker with this shit.

Ellie: Huh.

[She finds Eugene’s military badge.]

Ellie:Definitely. Eugene’s place. He was a Firefly?

Dina: He served with Tommy.

Ellie: I had no idea.

Dina: Yeah. They got into some real dark shit.

Ellie: Like what?

Dina: He said he blew up a checkpoint at Denver QZ. Killed three soldiers. And two civilians.

Ellie: Jesus.

Dina: He also told me that he and Tommy slow-tortured some big FEDRA general? I dunno. I don’t buy Tommy doing that, though.

Ellie: He could do worse.

Dina: What do you mean?

Ellie: He and Joel... did a lot to survive after the outbreak.

[She finds a photo.]

Ellie: Oh my god... it’s Tommy and Eugene. They look like babies here...

Dina: Lights. Heaters. There’s gotta be a generator around here somewhere.

Ellie: Hey. Found the generator.

[She pulls the rope a few times and starts the generator.]

Ellie: Huh, that’s better.

Dina: Oh, wow. Impressive workbench, Eugene. I bet you could mod your gun with this gear.

[Ellie adds several modifications to her guns.]

Ellie: Yeah... this’ll work.

Dina: Good job with that.

[They go out of the room. Dina squatters and begins to look at the floor.]

Dina: Oh hello... Ellie. Look at the floor! There’s more stuff down there!

Ellie: You see a way down?

Dina: Um, not here.

Ellie: Come on.

[Girls move the closet and find someone’s secret place.]

Dina: What’s he got down here?

Ellie: It’s obviously a sex den. That’s why he didn’t tell you about it.

Dina: I hope it’s a sex den, for his sake. He was so lonely, man.

[However, downstairs they find a farm where someone grew marijuana.]

Ellie: Oh... oh my god. It’s weed.

Dina: It’s a lot of dead weed. This explains a lot.

Ellie: Hey! He’s got that videotape thing.

Dina: Huh. "Dong of the Wolf". "Smash Brandi’s Cootch".

Ellie: Are these--?

Dina: It’s porn.

Ellie: (smirks) Interesting taste, Eugene.

[She finds a jar of joints.]

Dina: Oh! There we go.

Ellie: You think it’s still good?

Dina: Does weed go bad?

Ellie: Mm-mmm. Let’s find out.

[She is trying to open the jar.]

Dina: You having a hard time?

Ellie: No, I got it. Fuck.

Dina: Give me that.

Ellie: Oh, yeah, like you’re going to get it.

Dina: Okay. It’s...

Ellie: Yeah.

Dina: Fuck it.

[She smashes the jar.]

Ellie: What the fuck is wrong with you?

Dina: I got it open, didn’t I?

Ellie: (sighs) Smells good.

Dina: I mean... We’re gonna be stuck here a while, right?

[She lights a joint.]

Ellie: Totally trapped.

Dina: Can I ask you a question?

Ellie: I don’t know, can you?

[Ellie puffs the joint.]

Dina: Scale of one to ten. One being like absolute trash, and ten being life-altering… how would you rate our kiss from last night?

Ellie: Why are we still talking about this? You said it was a mistake.

Dina: Did I say that?

Ellie: What are you doing?

Dina: I asked you to rate our kiss.

Ellie: I don’t know.

Dina: I’d give it a six.

Ellie: A six! Wow.

Dina: Like a solid six.

Ellie: Okay.

Dina: There were a lot of people around.

Ellie: Yeah, but, six?

Dina: Oh, what? I mean, now I really want to know how you’d rate it.

Ellie: I don’t think you do.

Dina: You’re infuriating.

Ellie: Have you met you?

Dina: You make me want to go back outside into that blizzard.

Ellie: No one is stopping you.

Dina: This better be better than a six.

[She throws the joint away and they have a hot kiss. We go back to Abby, who is trying to escape the dead. She runs for her life.]

Abby: Whoa, whoa! Don’t stop...! Fuck! Okay... okay, up this way...! Damn it! Gotta get away...! Okay... okay... Oh shit... Shit! Ahh! No!

[An army of undead wants to eat her alive. Suddenly, Joel comes to her aid. He shoots the dead man who attacked Abby right in the head.]

Joel: Gimme your hand! We’re gonna have to run.

Tommy: There’s too many of them!

Joel: I’ll cover you, get going!

Tommy: C’mon, this way! Through here! Ah, shit! Hold up!

Joel: This way, c’mon!

[They are barricaded in the building.]

Joel: You okay?

Abby: Yeah.

Tommy: Where the hell’d they all come from?

Joel: It don’t matter. What does is where we goin’?

Tommy: I reckon we go out the back... We can make a break for the lodge.

Joel: Ain’t got a better idea. Hey. You got a gun?

Abby: Yeah.

Joel: Hope you’re a good shot. You keep up with us.

Tommy: We gotta warn everyone... come back with a cleanup crew.

Joel: We gotta live through this first. Watch them windows.

[Several dead people sneak into the building. Abby grabs an iron pipe and helps Tommy and Joel.]

Tommy: God damn it! These sumbitches are everywhere!

Joel: We gotta move!

Tommy: Get to the door! On the right! Through this door! C’mon!

Joel: Hurry! God damn it!

Tommy: That door ain’t gonna hold ‘em for long.

Joel: We need to hurry.

Tommy: Up there! The window! That’s our way out! You see a way up there?

Joel: Here, use this!

Tommy: Hey, girl! Push it up onto the cart!

Joel: They’re getting inside!

Tommy: I’ll get the gondola to the window... You two keep those infected offa me!

Joel: Okay!

Tommy: Damn, this thing is heavy! C’mon, god damn it... Move...

Joel: There’s a clicker!

Tommy: God damn it! Get this thing offa me! Help me with this thing!

[Abby kills the Clicker.]

Tommy: Saved my hide there!

Joel: You need me to take over?

Tommy: I got it! Just keep those infected away!

Joel: Tommy... I’m runnin’ low!

Tommy: Just need another minute!

Joel: Hey! You still with us?

Abby: Yeah!

Joel: Keep at ‘em! Watch out! Go to hell! How we doin’, Tommy?!

Tommy: Almost there! I got it! C’mon!

Joel: Go on, go! Hurry!

[They climb on the lowered carriage and jump out of the window.]

Joel: I gotcha! Stick close to us!

Abby: Where are we going?

Tommy: It’s this way, c’mon!

Abby: They’re everywhere!

Joel: Don’t slow down!

Tommy: Head for those doors! Through here! Let’s go!

[They hide in a barn. Tommy puts a large wooden bolt on the door. From the outside, the furious screams of the dead are heard.]

Tommy: Hey. I’m Tommy. That’s Joel. What’s your name?

Abby: Abby.

Tommy: Abby, are you okay?

Abby: Yeah.

Joel: That ain’t gonna hold. We gotta go back.

Tommy: We ain’t gonna outrun them all the way to Jackson. We need to barricade that door.

Joel: Tommy. we cannot stay here!

Tommy: The horses ain’t makin’ it all that way--

Abby: My friends! My friends are at a mansion just north of here. It’s fenced in. We have the whole perimeter secure.

Joel: It’s the Baldwin place. That could work.

Tommy: All right. I’ll get the door.

Joel: All right, you ride with me. C’mon. C’mon! Hold on tight!

[They get on horses. Joey helps Abby to climb on his horse. They leave the barn at the very moment when the dead are breaking the doors. We are going back to Ellie and Dina. They lie half-naked. Ellie touches Dina’s scar, located to the right of her navel.]

Ellie: What about this one?

Dina: When I was twelve, I found a skateboard.

Ellie: Uh oh!

Dina: And I tried to get on it, and it shot right out from underneath me.

Ellie: Wait, how did you get the scar?

Dina: I fell on my knife.

Ellie: (laughs) Okay. Um... The chemical burn. I did it myself.

Dina: Why?

Ellie: Uhh... To cover a bite mark. Right here. I got jumped by an infected when I was fourteen. And turns out I’m... immune, so it healed with a ring of fucked up teeth marks and cysts and-- (Dina hits her in the shoulder) Ow!

Dina: Fuck you.

Ellie: Hey!

Dina: I told you a real fucking story!

Ellie: I did tell you a real fucking story!

Dina: Oh, you want a bite mark? Did you hear that?

Jesse: Anyone down there?

Dina: Jesse?

Jesse: Dina?

Dina: Just stay there, okay?

Jesse: Are you okay? What’s going on?

Dina: Will you wait, please?!

[Jesse approaches them.]

Dina: What-- Just turn around, what are you doing?

Jesse: (turns around) Are you kidding me... You’re supposed to be on patrol.

Dina: There’s a blizzard outside!

Jesse: Is that weed?

Dina: Why are you here?

Jesse: People are counting on you! You get that? What we do matters!

Dina: Well, then why aren’t you at the fucking lookout?

Jesse: Because Tommy and Joel didn’t show up!

Ellie: What do you mean?

Jesse: We waited for them for an hour. I was looking for their horses when I saw lights.

Dina: Maybe they just went back to town.

Ellie: Without being replaced? No way. How much of their region have you covered?

Jesse: Not much.

Ellie: Then we split up. Go at it from different sides. We can cover the whole thing in a few hours.

Jesse: I don’t like you riding solo. We don’t know what’s out there.

Ellie: Exactly! What if they need help?

Jesse: Okay, I’ll head west, Dina can take south, and you come from the east. But be smart about it, yeah?

Ellie: Yeah.

[The excited Ellie goes to the exit. Meanwhile, Joel, Tommy and Abby galloping from a horde of undead people along a snow-covered forest path. They manage to get to Abby’s camp. Her friends close the iron gate and shoot the horde..]

Man: Hurry!

Man: Come on, hurry up!

Man: Push, push, come on!

Owen: Save your bullets!

[Several cocktails of hammer are thrown into the horde.]

Owen: Let’s get inside!

[They get the horses inside and close the garage doors.]

Man: (to Abby) You scared us.

Abby: I know.

Woman: How you guys doin’?

Tommy: We’re good, thanks.

Joel: Yeah.

Owen: Can I talk to you for a minute?

Woman: You wanna get those saddles off?

Joel: No, no, that’s all right. We’ll just ride out the storm and get out of your hair.

Tommy: Y’all got any brushes or a towel or anything?

Owen: (to Abby) You are nothing but lucky.

Abby: You have no idea.

Owen: Where the fuck have you been? And who are these people?

Tommy: How long you all been here?

Man: Since yesterday.

Joel: Yesterday.

Man: Yep.

Joel: What are y’all doing out this way?

Man: Oh, just passing through. You two live nearby?

Tommy: We do. A few hours down the hill. Y’all should come back with us. Restock before you head out.

Woman: Appreciate it.

Mel: I’m Mel, by the way.

Tommy: Tommy. This is my brother.

Joel: Joel. Y’all act like you’ve heard of us or something.

Abby: That’s ‘cause they have.

[Abby shoots Joel in the leg with a shotgun.]

Tommy: No!

[He punches closest to him, but he is quickly grabbed by the hands. A black girl strikes him on the head with the handle of the gun and Tommy falls to the floor.]

Owen: Get the other one! Nora? All clear?

Nora: He’s out.

Abby: Put him against the wall.

Joel: (groaning in pain) Tommy. Get off me! Get off me! Aahh!

Man: ¡Puta madre!

Abby: Joel Miller...

Joel: Who are you?

Abby: Guess.

Joel: Why don’t you say whatever speech you’ve got rehearsed and get this over with.

Abby: Tourniquet his leg. Do it!

Owen: Don’t you fuckin’ move.

[A boy or a girl, it is not clear right away, bandages Joel’s leg.]

Joel: God damn it!

Abby: Clear out.

[She raises the iron golf club.]

Abby: You stupid old man... You don’t get to rush this.

[Abby hits him on the head. The screen fades to black. Meanwhile, Ellie's riding along a snowy forest path and calling their friends.]

Ellie: Joel! Tommy! Oh, shit.

[She finds Abby’s camp and sees the gate in front of which lies a pile of burnt corpses.]

Ellie: How do I get down there? Okay. Shimmer.

[She leaves the horse and goes on foot.]

Ellie: Come on. Please be okay. Joel! Tommy! You’re okay, you’re okay. There it is Joel! Tommy!

[She enters the house.]

(distant screams)

Ellie: Where is that coming from?

(cries of pain)

Ellie: Joel-- Shit.

[It goes down from the top floor to the basement.]

(groans)

Ellie: Fuck.

(pained grunt)

(cries of pain)

(coughing)

[When she opens the basement door, she sees Abby beating Joel with an iron club, who is already barely breathing.]

Ellie: No…

[Ellie lifts her double-barrel, but she is attacked by several people and takes away her weapons.]

Nora: Pin her down!

Ellie: Get off me!

Nora: Get her hands!

Ellie: Get the fuck off me!

Man: Bitch.

[The guy who was slashed in the face several times by Ellie kicks her in the stomach. Someone drags him away.]

Man: You got her. Look, you got her! Okay?

Man: Let go!

Ellie: You’re gonna fucking die!

Owen: What’s going on?

Ellie: Let him go!

Mel: Who is that?

Ellie: Let him go!

Nora: She snuck in...

Owen: Why aren’t you posted up outside?

Nora: We didn’t think anyone was going to show up.

Owen: The hell did you expect? We gotta get out of here before the whole town’s on top of us. (to Abby) You’re done.

Abby: You want what I want, right?

Owen: End it. Now.

Ellie: Joel, get up. Joel, fucking get up. Please stop! Please don’t do this... Joel, please get up!

[Abby cracks Joel’s skull open.]

Ellie: Nooo! (sobs)

Man: Burn in hell, pendejo.

Ellie: I’ll fucking kill you... No!

Man: (muffled voices)

Ellie: No... I’ll fucking kill you.

Man: (muffled voices)

[Ellie is humming in her ears. She is overfilled with rage, despair, grief. Abby’s group, meanwhile, is discussing something, most likely Ellie’s fate. Eventually, the guy with the cutted face knocks Ellie out. Some time passes. Ellie’s friends find her.]

Dina: Ellie! Ellie? Ellie. I’m sorry. Jesse, they’re down here!

Ellie: (seeing Joel’s body) No. No…

[Ellie comes home. The experience was a real shock for her. She can’t wake up and looks at the emptiness sitting on her bed. Someone knocks on the door. Ellie opens it.]

Tommy: Hey.

Ellie: Hey.

[Tommy holds some kind of box in his hands.]

Tommy: Could I sit down, please?

Ellie: Yeah.

Tommy: Maria wants to make sure you’re eating.

Ellie: She can’t stop us.

Tommy: To have the guys that we would need... to do this smart... we’d be leaving Jackson vulnerable.

Ellie: So they just get to get away with this?

Tommy: Nobody wants that.

Ellie: Yeah, but that’s what’s happening,

Tommy: What if we get hit by hunters again?

Ellie: Is this you talking or is this her?

Tommy: It’s a valid point.

Ellie: If it were you or me, Joel would be halfway to Seattle already.

Tommy: No, he wouldn’t.

Ellie: He absolutely fucking would be--

Tommy: We don’t know for certain that they’re from Seattle.

Ellie: "Washington Liberation Front". That’s what you said was on those patches.

Tommy: What if they stole those jackets?

Ellie: That’s...

Tommy: What if the WLF moved?

Ellie: What are you doing? You know what? I’m leaving tomorrow. And if you want to come with me, great.

Tommy: You have no idea what you’re walking into. You don’t know how large that group is, how armed--

Ellie: I don’t care. You can’t talk me out of this.

Tommy: Give me a day to talk to Maria. Okay? Gotta be some folk she can spare.

Ellie: And if she won’t budge?

Tommy: Well, I’ll figure something out. One day. Please.

Ellie: Fine.

[They hug. Ellie cries.]

Tommy: Okay... Okay.

[He is leaving. The next day, Ellie is crying at Joel’s grave. After that, she gets up and comes to Dina.]

Ellie: I want to stop at his house before we leave. Just have to pick something up.

Dina: Okay. I couldn’t get to the horses. Looks like Tommy took one. Now Maria’s got the stables locked down.

Ellie: Fucking Tommy. We’ll figure something else out on the way. A car or a horse or something...

Dina: Okay.

Ellie: This makes getting to Seattle a lot harder.

Dina: Then it’s gonna be harder.

Ellie: You can still change your mind, you know...

Dina: I know.

Ellie: I just don’t want you to feel like you have to

Dina: Ellie. You go, I go. End of story.

Ellie: You need to get your backpack?

Dina: I hid it by the east gates. I figured we’d wanna slip out that way.

[They are slowly approaching Joel’s house. Ellie reaches for the door handle, but her hand trembles.]

Dina: Hey. What do you need, I can go get it.

Ellie: I want to do it.

Dina: Okay.

Ellie: I’m okay. Come on.

[They enter the house.]

Dina: I’ll hang out down here.

Ellie: Thanks.

[Ellie inspects the second floor of the house. She picks up various things that belonged to Joel to examine them and makes notes in her diary.]

Dina: Ellie! Can you come down here?

Ellie: Everything okay?

Dina: Yeah, just... Just come on down.

[When Ellie goes down to the first floor, she sees Maria. She holds a letter in her hands. She reads it.]

Maria: “Maria. I’m headed to Seattle. I wish I could let it go, but I can’t. I have to bring these people to justice. Ellie’s going to try to come after me but stop her. Take her guns. Lock up the horses. Maybe lock her up. Buy me some time so I can end this. Love you always. Tommy” He’s gonna get himself killed.

Ellie: He should’ve taken me with him. You should’ve given us a group to go after those fuckers!

Maria: I wish I could.

Ellie: You gonna try to lock me up?

Maria: I prefer that you stay--

Ellie: That’s not gonna fucking happen.

Maria: I prefer you stay, but I know you better. Are you going with her?

Dina: Yeah.

Maria: So you just gonna sneak outta here?

Ellie: Yeah.

Maria: On foot?

Ellie: Yeah.

Maria: I told the stable to let you out with your horse. Grab some ammo too.

Dina: Thank you, Maria.

Maria: Just, uh, do me a favor and bring my dumbass husband home in one piece, please.

Ellie: Of course.

Maria: All right then. Get going, you’re... you’re losing light.

SEATTLE DAY 1
[Ellie and Dina are riding through the fern forest on a horse.]

Ellie: This hunter was on top of him... drowning him. And... Joel couldn’t get to his gun.

Dina: Jeez... Were you scared?

Ellie: Well, I didn’t even think. I just... I just ran in there, grabbed his gun, and... shot the guy in the face.

Dina: How old were you?

Ellie: Fourteen. How old were you when you first killed someone?

Dina: We talking infected?

Ellie: No. Fully conscious, non-fungal person.

Dina: Ten.

Ellie: Wow. What happened?

Dina: Guy was coming at my mom. I stabbed him.

Ellie: Shit... You got me beat.

Dina: Yeah, I’m a real badass. So how lost are we?

Ellie: Uhh, we’re not.

Dina: Uh-huh.

Ellie: Hey, have a little faith.

Dina: What about those crazy cannibals you said you and Joel ran into? They came after you guys once... maybe these WLFs are connected to them.

Ellie: No. Didn’t seem like the same group.

Dina: Maybe those black market smugglers back in Boston?

Ellie: Dina, Joel crossed a lot of people... I don’t see the point in guessing.

Dina: Okay.

Ellie: At least until we find out more information.

[For some time, they ride silently.]

Dina: Ellie. Cars.

Ellie: Yeah, we’re getting close. Start keeping an eye out.

Dina: Got it.

[They get off the horse.]

Ellie: Another superhero card.

Dina: Question: if you could have one superpower, what would it be?

Ellie: Hmm. Probably... invisibility?

Dina: Strong choice. Is that so you can spy on me?

Ellie: That’s exactly it.

[They keep riding the horse.]

Ellie: Here we go...

Dina: Guess I was wrong... Turns out you do know where you’re going.

Ellie: Stay with Shimmer.

Dina: Yeah. Anything good in there?

Ellie: Found an old tourist map...

Dina: Well... That’s something. Sure seems quiet.

Ellie: Yeah... Think about how well we hide our lookouts.

Dina: I know... That’s what scares me. Whoa. Is that the QZ?

Ellie: Yup. Watch the high spots.

[They find a couple of corpses.]

Ellie: These were soldiers from the QZ. See the FEDRA uniforms?

Dina: You think it was the WLF?

Ellie: Yeah, and they left them here. Like a warning.

Dina: That’s fucked up. Looks like there are some cracks up there, in the wall up above? Anything good in there?

Ellie: Pretty picked over.

Dina: You see it?

Ellie: Yeah. Not sure how we get up there, though...

Dina: "WLF. Trespassers killed on sight." That’s friendly. At least we know we’re in the right place.

Ellie: Where is everyone?

Dina: They put up this sign... Means there’s gotta be a way in. Are these cages?

Ellie: “Holding cells.” Soldiers had them in Boston, too.

[She climbs the cell and comes to the high hanging ladder.]

Ellie: Dina, hey! Help me up here.

[Dina helps Ellie jump up the ladder.]

Dina: I’ll keep an eye out. Just see if you can get the gate open from the other side.

Ellie: Sounds good.

[She climbs up and jumps on pieces of metal sticking out of the wall.]

Ellie: Oh, fuck.

Dina: Ellie?!

Ellie: I’m good! Just almost died.

[She gets to the other side of the wall.]

Ellie: Where are these fuckers?

[At the checkpoint, she finds a sheet with codes.]

Ellie: Okay... wonder when was this written? The Serevena Base. That’s something… (sees a big generator) Now that’s a generator. (turns it on) Ha!

[She’s trying to open the first gate to let Dina in.]

Ellie: Course that doesn’t work. (gets electrocuted) Ahh, shit! Okay.

[The gate is open.]

Dina: Ellie? Ellie! Over here!

[She approaches the second, large gate. Dina looks at her through the lookout slot.]

Ellie: Hey.

Dina: Everything okay? What was that sound?

Ellie: I got that gate open. I gotta figure out this one now.

Dina: Well, we believe in you.

Ellie: Thanks.

[She finds a cable and plugs it into different sockets to power the gate from the generator.]

Elie: Phew! Okay.

[The second gates open.]

Ellie: Yes!

Dina: Well done!

[Dina brings Shimmers to the territory. The power lasts only for a few seconds and the heavy gate goes down with rumble, almost killing the poor horse.]

Ellie: Shit!

Dina: Hey, come on! Let’s get out of here. That crash was pretty loud.

[They get on the horse.]

Dina: Now what?

Ellie: I found a note back there... It had some codes on it. Oh shit, look! Serevena Hotel.

Dina: That’s gotta be it.

[They get off the horse.]

Dina: Okay. Let’s find a way past this... uh... “Fuck” FEDRA gate.

Ellie: Very creative. Gets right to the point. Let’s get closer and scope it out.

[She finds the list of the expelled.]

Ellie: Idiots. Just turning everyone against you…

Dina: Do you know the code?

Ellie: That note I found has a bunch of ‘em... But we need to get power to the gate first. Okay, here we go.

[She’s trying to turn on the generator.]

Ellie: Ugh! It’s outta gas.

Dina: God damn it. Well, what do we do now?

Ellie: Oh shit! The note!

Dina: What?

Ellie: The note mentioned that there’s gas in the courthouse garage and "the dome."

Dina: All right. Courthouse garage and the dome. So what’s the plan for finding these places?

Ellie: We ride around and see what we see.

Dina: You think Tommy came through here?

Ellie: Bet he did. So... where are we?

Dina: Pretty sure... we’re here.

Ellie: Ah, nice. I’ll mark it up as we go.

Dina: What the hell happened out here?

Ellie: I’m guessing the military bombed the shit out of this place.

Dina: Why would they do that?

Ellie: Well, they would sometimes destroy parts of the city that were... Lost to the infected. Or to rebels.

Dina: That seems like overkill.

Ellie: Well... it usually worked.

Dina: On the infected or the rebels?

Ellie: Both.

Dina: Shit.

Ellie: Believe me, you’re lucky you didn’t grow up in a QZ.

Dina: I’m starting to get that impression.

[They enter a partially collapsed building.]

Dina: This is cool... in, like, a holy-shit-we-might-get-crushed kind of way.

Ellie: Relax. It’s probably been like this for years... it’s not going to collapse today.

[She kills some clickers.]

Ellie: Okay... That’s all of them.

Dina: What’s with the body armor? They don’t look like soldiers.

Ellie: Yeah... not sure. Where are we?

Dina: You think this is the bank?

Ellie: Looks like a bank...

Dina: Fancy-schmancy.

Ellie: I think these body armor guys were trying to rob the bank.

Dina: Oh shit! It’s like that movie.

Ellie: Which one?

Dina: The one with the surfer bank robbers.

Ellie: Oh yeah... I love that movie.

[This movie is “Point Break”. She cracks the safe.]

Ellie: Got it. Okay.

[Going inside, she takes a shotgun from a corpse.]

Ellie: Thanks, dude.

Dina: Look at all this money! The bag’s full.

Ellie: Man! If we were back in the old world, woo! We’d be rich.

[In one of the lockers Ellie finds Nathan Drake’s ring. This nice reference suggests that game events occur after Uncharted 4.]

Ellie: Cool...

Dina: Over there. There’s a runner. I think we’re done with this place.

Ellie: Agreed.

[They leave the bank.]

Ellie: Hey, if you lived in the old world... What would you buy with all that money?

Dina: I don’t know. Maybe a big farmhouse?

Ellie: But you can get a farmhouse now...

Dina: Okay. What would you get?

Ellie: A space shuttle.

Dina: Aww, that’s right. Your astronaut thing.

Ellie: Hey! It’s cooler than a farmhouse.

Dina: Farmhouse is way more practical.

Ellie: (exaggerated yawn)

Dina: That place was crazy.

Ellie: Well, we got a shotgun out of it, so... not complaining. All right, let’s find that gas. Think we cleared this place out.

Dina: Whoa, check out the tank.

Ellie: Kinda sad.

[Ellie climbs on the car weighing at the edge of the destroyed bridge and jumps off it.]

Dina: Dude.

Ellie: Easy jump. Don’t worry.

Dina: Worrying’s in my blood so...

[Ellie sees a fire truck.]

Ellie: Man... Check this out! This thing’s a relic… (picks up an axe) There we go.

[She goes down a rope hanging over an abyss.]

Dina: Uh, Ellie?

Ellie: Yeah?

Dina: Do you know what you’re doing?

Ellie: I think so.

[Thanks to the rope she manages to jump to the other side of the bridge.]

Ellie: Got it! Got it!

Dina: Nice one! On my way!

[Ellie finds a Survival Guide.]

Ellie: Could be good...

Dina: Uh... Is this place sturdy?

Ellie: I dunno.

Dina: Careful.

Ellie: Made it. Hello.

[She finds a superhero card of Doctor Uckmann.]

Ellie: Okay. Think that’s everything here.

Dina: Hey. That building’s got something on top I’d call dome-like.

Ellie: Yeah, you’re right... It’s on the map now. Hey. "Valiant Music Shop".

Dina: Should we check for supplies?

Ellie: Man. Imagine this place when everything was intact. You could just goof off... play some instruments.

Dina: I bet we could scrounge enough stuff to start a band.

Ellie: You don’t know how to play anything.

Dina: I mean, I could definitely figure it out!

Dina: Yo! Check this out.

[She knocks on the drums and the plate several times. The sound, however, is disgusting.]

Ellie: Ooh. Wow. That was... that was an interesting beat!

Dina: Excuse me, I am a natural... Admit it.

Ellie: I love you?

Dina: Whatever. We’re starting a band.

Ellie: How about you be my groupie?

Dina: Your what?

Ellie: Okay. Bands apparently had these hardcore fans that would just follow them around.

Dina: Isn’t that what I’m already doing?

Ellie: Uh... I guess so.

Dina: Mm-hmm.

[On the second floor, Ellie finds the guitar in a case. She takes it out and sits down to try to play.]

Ellie: (singing)
If I ever were to lose you

Dina: What was that?

Ellie: Nothing.

Dina: Hmm. Well, nothing sure sounds nice.

Ellie: Remember that night by the bonfire?

Dina: Yeah.

[Deena sits down to listen to Ellie sing.]

Ellie: (singing)
Talking away
I don’t know what
I’m to say I’ll say it anyway
Today’s another day to find you
Shying away
I’ll be coming for your love, okay
Take on me
Take me on
I’ll be gone
In a day or two
Needless to say
I’m odds and ends
But I’ll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It’s no better to be safe than sorry
Take on me
Take me on
I’ll be gone
In a day or two
In a day or two

Dina: You should’ve kissed me then.

Ellie: I wanted to.

Dina: Me too.

Ellie: All right. We should keep moving.

Dina: Yeah.

Dina: They got a bunch of records here. The Sleek Habit.

Ellie: The SICK Habit.

Dina: Close enough.

Ellie: Uhh, okay, we only listened to it like a hundred times together.

Dina: I was only listening to it because I thought you were cute.

Ellie: Don’t think there’s anything else in here.

[They leave the music store and go into town.]

Ellie: (finds a drawing) Damn... That’s pretty good. (making a note) Jotting this down. (finds a FEDRA scanner) Oof. Haven’t seen one of these in a while. Looks like that’s everything over here.

Dina: Where are you going?

Ellie: There’s something back here. There.

Dina: That was some good scavenging.

Ellie: Cleaned this place out.

Dina: Hey. I think I found the courthouse.

Ellie: How can you tell?

Dina: Um, see that sign up there? On the building that says "Courthouse"?

Ellie: Oh, well. Nice work, detective.

Dina: Mm-hmm. Mark this place on the map.

[They find an old diner.]

Dina: Wasn’t Joel all about coffee?

Ellie: You kidding me? He’d trade half his stuff for a bag of beans.

Dina: I never got it. Tastes like... burnt... shit.

Ellie: Thank you. Acquired taste, my ass.

[In the toilet, she is attacked by a dead woman.]

Ellie: Oh shit!

Dina: You okay?

Ellie: Yeah.

Dina: How do they get inside these places?

Ellie: I don’t know, but I hate that shit. Okay. I think we got what we need.

[They leave the diner.]

Dina: Hear that?

Ellie: I hear it. Infected.

Dina: It’s coming from the courthouse. This is gonna suck, isn’t it?

Ellie: At least we’re ready for ‘em.

[Ellie manages to open the door with a lockpick.]

Ellie: Oh shit... I got it!

Dina: Let’s see what we got in here. The hell is this place?

Ellie: Some kind of WLF something...

Dina: What is that?

Ellie: WLF propaganda. Reminds me of the Fireflies in Boston.

Dina: In New Mexico, we had these guys called The Ravens. “Protectors of the Constitution,” they called themselves.

Ellie: (finds a stun bomb) Score. (sees a drawn map) What’s this?

Dina: These are plans to hit a FEDRA convoy. This place must be old.

Ellie: Yeah... I don’t think anybody’s been here in years.

Dina: We could take a look.

Ellie: Think we got everything here.

Dina: Got a caravan up ahead.

Ellie: What went down here?

Dina: Looks like an ambush... Check out the bullet holes on the side of this truck.

Ellie: Whoa! This guy was an officer.

Dina: Traveling in a ration truck?

Ellie: Trying to hide, maybe?

Dina: Unsuccessfully.

Ellie: Yeah. Sure looks that way. Oh, man.

Dina: "Ration Distribution Center."

Ellie: In Boston, we’d line up for blocks. And the food sucked.

Dina: I’d go crazy.

Ellie: Some people did. C’mon, let’s find a way in. (finds some bullets) Score.

Dina: FEDRA secured the shit out of this place.

Ellie: Boston always had food shortages. Hungry people get desperate. Can you get through?

Dina: All right, I got you. Shit, infected!

Ellie: Stay low. Watch it!

Dina: I think we dropped all of them.

Ellie: Yeah, looks that way. (sees a group of undead) Shit. I don’t get it... If there was still people around, they would’ve cleared this place out. Right?

Dina: Maybe they didn’t make to this spot?

Ellie: Maybe... Let’s find that gas. Shit. Latch is on the other side. Found the gas... Just need to get back there.

Dina: Hey, Ellie... This place is a synagogue.

Ellie: How can you tell?

Dina: One, there are menorah decorations on the wall. It’s a Jewish thing. Two, I didn’t burst into flames just now.

Ellie: Burst into flames?

Dina: It’s just a dumb joke.

Ellie: Unlike your other ones?

Dina: You shut it. This place brings back a lot of memories. My sister used to drag me to a synagogue all the time.

Ellie: You never struck me as much of a believer.

Dina: Nah. But I like coming from a long line of survivors.

Ellie: You mean after Outbreak Day?

Dina: That... And the Inquisition... And the Holocaust... My family always made it out alive... Barely.

Ellie: Okay…

[She finds a barrel of fuel.]

Ellie: Here we go. Ugh, god damn it.

Dina: Hey! Language. House of worship here.

Ellie: It’s empty.

Dina: That sucks. Now what?

Ellie: We’ll try our luck at the courthouse garage. Let’s get out of here.
Ellie: Do you still pray?

Dina: Sometimes.

Ellie: Really? When?

Dina: I said one when we left Jackson. I said one at Joel’s grave... Sometimes I just... say little ones to myself.

Ellie: Does it help?

Dina: I think it calms me. Helps me put things in perspective... It’s a way to deal with grief. A way to show respect... It’s what I know.

Ellie: There we go. This way.

Dina: Right behind you.

Ellie: Hmm...

Dina: Hey, what’re you doing?

Ellie: Bet I can get to the other balcony with this.

Dina: Um... Okay.

[Ellie grubs a rope hanging from the ceiling.]

Dina: Ellie! Careful.

Ellie: It’s okay... it’s holding... Nothing to it. C’mon, Dina.

Dina: Right...

Ellie: I hope you got where you were going. 5774? Are we in the future?

Dina: No, doofus, that’s a Hebrew calendar. For the new year, my sister used to give me an apple dipped in honey. Ugh, now I’m craving it.

Ellie: What’s this?

Dina: Oh, this is the Torah!

Ellie: The what?

Dina: Uh, it’s scripture, it’s like a Jewish bible.

Ellie: Oh.

Dina: My sister would have flipped for this. My sister would have flipped for this. The one we used in New Mexico was half-burnt. All right. Well... at least they didn’t just chuck everything.

[After searching the synagogue and taking everything valuable, Ellie and Dina jump out the window.]

Ellie: Okay. Cross the dome off the list.

Dina: Let’s go find the courthouse. It might be worth grabbing some supplies before we press on. It’s peaceful out here, at least.

Ellie: It’s weird being in a QZ and not hearing trucks. Or gunfire and explosions.

Dina: My sister always avoided QZs. That’s probably why. She just got more and more paranoid... She’d sometimes wake up screaming in the middle of the night.

Ellie: That’s rough.

Dina: We always had a bag packed so we could bail if something happened. Never stayed in one place for more than a few weeks… It sucked.

Ellie: Nice to have a place we call home, right?

Dina: Yeah. When I first got to Jackson. I was so overwhelmed by all the people.

Ellie: I was overwhelmed by all the food. I remember my first week just gorging myself. Stuffing food in all my pockets for later like it was gonna run out.

Dina: I saw that!

Ellie: You did not.

Dina: I did, I remember thinking, “Who is this string bean girl stealing all the jerky?”

Ellie: I didn’t steal that much jerky.

[She tries the front door, but it’s locked.]

Ellie: Ehh. Worth a try.

Dina: Let’s keep looking.

[They find a way into the courthouse.]

Dina: Shh!

[It’s full of Clickers.]

Ellie: Here we go.

[Ellie quietly kills all of the Clickers.]

Dina: Is that it?

Ellie: I think so.

Dina: Go team.

Ellie: Let’s find that gas.

Dina: Yeah. I wonder what it was like to serve on a jury... Bet it was fun. Sit down. Look at evidence... Try to tell if somebody’s lying...

Ellie: Just give me five minutes and my knife. I’d tell you if they were lying or not.

Dina: Oh, wow. Okay.

Ellie: Hey, a little help?

Dina: Comin’. You ever been to a courthouse before?

Ellie: Nope.

Dina: You’re telling me you never got in trouble back in Boston?

Ellie: Oh, I got in trouble... but never landed in a courthouse.

Dina: Some serious shit went down here.

Ellie: Brought it on yourself, I guess. FEDRA soldiers. Check out that wall. They were executed.

Dina: Jesus. They weren’t just executed... They shot them to pieces.

Ellie: Maybe bullets weren’t scarce yet. Maybe they deserved it.

Dina: Maybe.

Ellie: Ugh... This might come in handy.

[She pulls a machete out of the body. Near it there is a note.]

Dina: What’s it say?

Ellie: This guy was a FEDRA Commander or something. They were losing to the WLF and trying to escape.

Dina: How big is this group if they were able to beat the army?

Ellie: You don’t need a lot if you’re that vicious. We need to be careful.

Dina: Let’s just be smart about it.

Ellie: Okay, Jesse. (cracks a safe) What’ve you got for me?

[They continue to explore the courthouse.]

Ellie: Parking garage.

Dina: The gas is in there, right?

Ellie: That’s what the note said.

Dina: Let’s get down there. Careful.

[The parking lot appears to be full of undead. Dina kills one of them.]

Dina: Shit! Hey, I got one!

Ellie: Jesus. I think that’s all of them.

Dina: Those FEDRA guys never even made it out of the garage. Damn. Well, let’s find that gas...

[She tries another tank.]

Dina: And?

Ellie: Wait... We got gasoline!

Dina: Our luck’s changin’!

Ellie: Don’t you jinx us. The Fuck FEDRA gate is calling to us.

Dina: Now how do we get outta here?

Ellie: Hmm. Dina.

[She finds the manual control of the gate.]

Dina: Coming. Come on! Okay, let go!

Ellie: Good job, babe.

Dina: Thanks.

[They leave the courthouse.]

Ellie: Okay. Gate.

Dina: Onward, Shimmer!

Ellie: How’re you doing back there? Getting homesick?

Dina: A little bit. You?

Ellie: Same. Miss having a roof over my head.

Dina: You know... I’ve always dreamed of fixing up a farm... Just outside of Jackson.

Ellie: Why wouldn’t you stay in town?

Dina: I dunno. I like the idea of real space.

Ellie: Sounds lonely.

Dina: Only if you’re doing it alone.

Ellie: Okay. So are we going to like... raise sheep and milk cows?

Dina: Are you making fun of me?

Ellie: (smiles) No. It actually sounds... kinda nice.

Dina: Really?

Ellie: Yeah. Really.

Dina: Well. That was an adventure.

Ellie: Haven’t found any of ‘em yet.

Dina: Hey... It’s a big city. We barely started looking.

Ellie: Yeah, I know... Just thought we’d see one of them by now.

[It gets off the horse and fuels the generator.]

Ellie: Here we go. All right.

Dina: I got it. You put in the code.

Ellie: Hey, these old generators are pretty finicky, so it might take you a few tries to-- Oh.

Dina: (starts the generator on the first try) Sorry, go on?

Ellie: Nothing!

Dina: It worked!

Ellie: Well, no welcoming committee.

Dina: Or they’re just waiting for us.

Ellie: Let’s look for a way in.

[They get back on the horse and continue their journey.]

Ellie: Keep an eye on those windows.

Dina: Wolf. WLF. I get it.

Ellie: Oh yeah. That make sense.

Dina: You see that? Infected just hopped that fence.

Ellie: Means we can get in that way...

Dina: Shouldn’t we hear gunshots or something?

Ellie: I don’t know what’s going on…

[She enters the hotel with a gun ready to go. The moans of the dead can be heard from the inside.]

Ellie: Watch out!

Dina: The fuck’re you doing?!

Ellie: Okay. That’s that.

Dina: Ugh. This one’s fresh. And he’s got one of those wolf patches.

Ellie: Guess they didn’t make it out with their gas after all.

Dina: That’s good, right?

Ellie: If those fuckers who killed Joel got taken out by some random infected...

Dina: Then they’d still be dead, Ellie.

Ellie: I’m not sure that’s justice. Might as well grab what we can while we’re here.

[She finds a corpse.]

Ellie: They’ve been shot.

Dina: You recognize them?

Ellie: No.

Dina: Maybe someone else killed these guys... The infected just wandered in.

Ellie: Don’t recognize this one either.

[In one of the hotel rooms on the second floor Ellie finds a mutilated dead man tied to a chair.]

Dina: Shit. The fuck happened here?

Ellie: Tommy did this.

Dina: This? No way.

Ellie: It was definitely him. This is one of the ones that killed Joel.

Dina: Shit. There’s another one over here.

Ellie: I don’t recognize him. He was using them against each other.

Dina: How?

Ellie: Joel told me about this. You ask this guy a question, but you don’t make him say it… you make him write it down. Then you ask this guy. And if the facts match, they’re telling the truth. If not…

Dina: You fuck’em up.

Ellie: Yeah.

Dina: East One. Another gate code?

Ellie: Looks like it.

Dina: This just happened, El. He can’t be far off.

Ellie: Yeah.

Dina: C’mon. We can get out this way. Maybe catch up with Tommy.

Ellie: Yeah.

[They leave the hotel.]

Dina: I know you said Tommy had a rough past, but... Fuck.

Ellie: I know. Are you okay?

Dina: It wasn’t pretty…

[They get back on the horse.]

Ellie: I don’t want you to think bad of Tommy--

Dina: Ellie. If I had my sister’s killers tied to a chair... I’d do worse.

Ellie: I hear you.

Dina: You get the generator... I’ll open the gate.

Ellie: You remember the code?

Dina: The one written in blood? Yeah.

Ellie: Got it!

Dina: And I... got... this!

[She opens the gate.]

Dina: Big question though... Where does this take us? I say we find shelter, and we set up camp. Maybe somewhere high up so we can scope out the area.

Ellie: I like that idea.

Dina: Okay... Let’s look for an open building.

Ellie: Preferably with no infected. Or WLF.

Dina: Wolves.

Ellie: Whatever.

Dina: I still have some of those almond things left, if you’re hungry,

Ellie: Ehh... not really.

Dina: You should eat something…

[That’s the way it is every day, they come across a mine behind the usual chatter. The girl is scattered around. The horse takes over the main explosion. Two guys run up to the girls.]

Man: Get the other! Don’t lose her! Go!

Ellie: Dina.

[The third man shoots in the head of the agonizing Shimmers. Ellie tries to resist lying on the ground, but the man takes the rifle from her and hits her with the butt. Ellie loses consciousness. She comes to herself tied up in some storage room.]

Man: Didn’t think I’d ever see you again. How’d you find us?

Ellie: I asked about a dude with a bitch scar across his face.

[He puts a knife to Ellie’s face.]

Man: Hmm, that’s funny. How many came with you? Hmm? Just you two?

Ellie: You can’t stop this.

Man: Jordan! You’re supposed to be out looking for the other one! What the fuck is this?

Jordan: Y’know that smuggler that we killed out in Jackson?

Man: Yeah.

Jordan: This girl was there.

Man: What?

Jordan: They’re coming after us. That’s why Nick was fucked up like that. We gotta get her to Isaac, and we gotta tell him exactly what’s going on.

Man: Yeah, well, I just got off the radio with Isaac. And we got a new mandate.

Jordan: Hmm?

Man: Kill all trespassers.

[He takes the gun out of the holster.]

Jordan: Hold up, hold up, that doesn’t make any sense.

Man: It’s a direct order, man--

Jordan: No. Let’s talk to her, let’s figure out what she knows--

Man: I don’t give a fuck what she knows! You saw what she did to the others.

Jordan: You have no idea how many people she might be with. This might be an ambush, Mike--

Man: I don’t care how many people she’s with. We will find them. We will kill them.

Jordan: Can you just think for yourself for a quick second--

Man: Jordan, get the fuck outta my way--

[He is going to shoot Ellie when suddenly Dean shoots him through the glass roof. Jordan shoots back and Deena falls into the room.]

Ellie: Dina!

Jordan: Jesus. You shouldn’t have come here.

Ellie: Dina!

[He comes up to Deena and starts choking her. Ellie realizes that she cannot tear up the ropes, so she pulls up a piece of stone with her foot. Once the ropes are cutted, she runs to Jordan and stuck her knife into his neck a few times. He dies choking on his own blood.]

Ellie: Got you, motherfucker. Are you okay?

Dina: Mostly. Ellie. Ellie. We should go. Somebody would’ve heard the gunshots.

[Ellie searches Jordan’s rupee and finds a letter with a picture of Abby.]

Ellie: Look. She’s one of them.

Dina: C’mon. Look at that later.

WLF Soldier: Shots fired!

Ellie: Was there a TV station on that map?

Dina: I don’t fuckin’ know. Come on. Fuck, Ellie!

[WLF Soldier shoots at them. The girls have to defend themselves.]

WLF Soldier: Shit! It’s both of them!

Dina: I’ll cover you, go around. Let’s go!

Ellie: How many guys did you see?

Dina: Enough. We gotta get the hell outta here.

WLF Soldier: It was this way! Move up!

Ellie: Shit.

WLF Soldier: Clear the rooms!

Ellie: Ahh!

Dina: Straight ahead! Look out! Got him.

Ellie: You good?

Dina: Yeah, You recognize any of these guys?

Ellie: No.

Dina: Watch it.

WLF Soldier: I want everybody down here now!

Dina: Great. More of ‘em.

WLF Soldier: Where’d the fuck those shots come from?

WLF Soldier: I dunno. Search the courtyard! You, hold the cafeteria. I’ll cover here.

WLF Soldier: Right.

[Ellie kills the girl in command from behind.]

Ellie: Shh. Quiet. Quiet.

WLF Soldier: Shit! Shit!

Dina: Ellie! Up there! More of them!

WLF Soldier: Scars?

WLF Soldier: I don’t know!

Dina: Ellie. Over there.

WLF Soldier: Spread out!

[Eliie kills another WLF soldier taking his gun and stuck her knife in his neck.]

Ellie: Don’t. Shh. Shut up. Just shut up.

Ellie: Shut it. Fuck, there’s a lot of them.

Dina: I told you.

[Ellie quietly kills several soldiers.]

Dina: Have a look here.

WLF Soldier: What’ve we got? Anything?

Dina: Oh no. Over there. Ellie! Get down!

WLF Soldier: Holy shit! Trespasser’s loose!

Dina: To the right! Get the fuck off her!

[Ellie arms herself with an iron pipe and fights the soldiers in the dark corridors of a dilapidated building.]

Dina: Think that’s all of ‘em?

Ellie: Let’s not find out.

[They understand that they cannot get out of the building.]

Ellie: Fuck.

[Dina notices the ventilation grate.]

Dina: What about this?

Ellie: Let’s try it.

[When girls get out, they notice a truck with soldiers approaching the building.]

Dina: Get down!

WLF Soldier: Come on! Inside!

Dina: Come on.

Ellie: We gotta get away from this school. Now.

Dina: There has to be a way down to the street somewhere.

Ellie: I got it. Come on.

Dina: We need to get to the street.

Ellie: All right, coast looks clear.

Dina: Yeah. I think we’re good.

Ellie: All right... check this out.

[She shows Dina some girls’ photo.]

Dina: (whistles)

Ellie: She’s one of them.

Dina: Well, fuck her then.

Ellie: Read the letter.

Dina: “Jordan, Isaac’s got us posted up on a two week at the TV station. Scars spotted in the area. Here’s something to hold you over. Leah”

Ellie: (points at her map) TV station.

Dina: You think she’s still there?

Ellie: We gotta find out, right?

Dina: So, it’s by all these tall buildings. That way.

Ellie: Okay. Let’s go get Leah.

[They continue the journey.]

Dina: You good?

Ellie: Yeah. I thought I was fucked back there. Thanks for the save, by the way.

Dina: Of course.

Ellie: So those are the Wolves... They’re really armed.

Dina: Yeah, they are. Did you think there were gonna be this many of them?

Ellie: Tommy said this was a possibility.

Dina: Does that change anything for you?

Ellie: No. I wonder if there’s anything left in these buildings?

Dina: There’s always something left behind... Keep an eye out for patrols. There were a bunch trying to smoke me out around here.

Ellie: How many?

Dina: I passed two, but I got a feeling there were more.

[Suddenly they are attacked by a dead man.]

Dina: Got him?

Ellie: Yeah.

Dina: Shit. My heart’s racing.

Ellie: Same.

Dina: What are you doing with that?

Ellie: It’s stuck.

Dina: Hey, maybe try getting it off the curb? Now what’re you gonna do with it?

Ellie: I’ll be back in a sec.

Dina: I’ll keep watch.

Ellie: The fuck is this? Some kind of bomb?

Dina: Was it worth it?

Ellie: Yeah. Pretty good haul.

Dina: I can still kinda see the buildings. How you wanna go?

Ellie: Uhh... let’s see…

[There is a patrol nearby.]

WLF Soldier: He was the worst. You’re nuts.

Dina: Ellie.

WLF Soldier: At least he made something other than fucking burritos every third day. I’m sick of it.

Dina: Wolves.

Ellie: Shit.

WLF Soldier: You know how many times I got food poisoning? Why do you think I took up fishing? I’m getting hungry.

WLF Soldier: Yeah? Stop talking about food, then.

WLF Soldier: Yeah....

Ellie: Shut it.

WLF Soldier: Ugh... where the fuck is this girl...

WLF Soldier: Somewhere in this area.

WLF Soldier: And we’re sure she ain’t a Scar? She was riding a horse.

WLF Soldier: Not a Scar.

WLF Soldier: Well, then Scars will probably kill her. Let’s do our job so we can go back and eat, okay?

WLF Soldier: No way we’re finding her before Scars or infected do.

WLF Soldier: Good. Then find the body and let’s bring her back.

Dina: Heads up. Over there.

Ellie: Shh. Quiet.

WLF Soldier: Been thinking about asking for a transfer to the cages.

Dina: Ellie. Another patrol.

WLF Soldier: Don’t do it, man. The smell in that place will make you drop weight immediately.

WLF Soldier: I think it’d be a good opportunity. Beat up on those fuckers... get facetime with Isaac.

WLF Soldier: The shit he asks you to do to them, though. When they’re fucking crying... it’s... it’s rough

WLF Soldier: I’ll be fine.

WLF Soldier: All right. Well... I’ll put in a word for you.

WLF Soldier: Appreciate it.

WLF Soldier: Lemme give you some advice, though.

WLF Soldier: Shoot.

WLF Soldier: Get the information and be done with it. Don’t get carried away.

WLF Soldier: Depends on the Scar. Am I right? (chuckles)

Dina: Watch it. To the left. Whoa! To the right!

Ellie: (killing a soldier) Don’t. (to Dina) See any more?

Dina: No.

Ellie: How many guys did they send looking for you?

Dina: Too many. Over there. Clicker!

Ellie: Fuck, watch out! All right.

Dina: These WLF guys went up against the military over a decade ago. Why are they still so amped? There can’t be that many trespassers that come through here...

Ellie: I don’t know... City still looks like it’s filled with supplies. I can’t see why people would need to fight over it.

Dina: Hey. Infected. Runner. On your left.

Dina: Got you. On our right! Look out! Got you! Careful. To your left. On the right. Look out.

Ellie: Man... …’Kay, there.

Dina: All quiet. You good?

Ellie: Yeah. Now what?

Dina: We gotta get through this checkpoint wall... those buildings are on the other side.

Ellie: Look around. There has to be a way over.

Dina: Let’s get up to the second floor. Hey, think it’s this way. Okay, we got over.

Ellie: Hey, Dina.

Dina: Yeah. Gimme your hand? Hey that round building! It looks like the TV station from your map.

Ellie: Yeah. C’mon. I don’t know how I would’ve done all this without you...

Dina: Look at you...

Ellie: Shut up.

Dina: I never would’ve let you do this by yourself. What the fuck was that!

[The next dead man to them suddenly explodes.]

Ellie: It ran into a trap.

Dina: A what?

Ellie: Explosive traps. Watch where you’re walking.

Dina: Okay... Where are you going?

Ellie: Hold on a second.

Dina: Any Wolves?

Ellie: I didn’t see any... but it’s hard to tell!

Dina: I think we gotta get down this.

Ellie: Oh shit!

Dina: Ellie?

[She goes down a clayey wet slope.]

Ellie: Fuck... C’mon!

Dina: This Leah chick... What if she’s gone by the time we get there?

Ellie: I don’t want to think about that right now.

Dina: We should put some of those trip wires up around Jackson. Might be a good way to deal with the hordes. Hey. Look.

[She finds several corpses and a dead horse.]

Ellie: Holy shit. These were all shot. Hey, look. It’s Tommy’s. Infected did a number on this one...

Dina: (vomits)

Ellie: Are you okay?

Dina: Yeah, sorry. It’s just... the smell.

Ellie: All right. He must’ve taken off on foot. You good to keep going?

Dina: Yeah, I’m fine. Please.

[They go on.]

Dina: How did this city get so wrecked? Boston wasn’t like this, was it?

Ellie: Boston didn’t have a full-blown civil war. The Fireflies never put up this kind of resistance. You see the TV station?

Dina: Yeah. It’s that way. Uphill.

Ellie: Whoa. More bodies.

Dina: More shot bodies. Stop! Tripwire.

Ellie: Thanks.

Dina: They’re all over.

Ellie: Probably for infected.

Dina: Still... one wrong step...

Ellie: Yeah, let’s be careful.

Dina: They’ve really got this area covered.

Ellie: Probably don’t cut through here much with all this.

Dina: There’s that silver lining.

[Ellie opens the door from which a dead man crawls.]

Dina: Fuck, watch it! Are you okay?

Ellie: Yeah. Yeah. (cracks a safe) Oh shit... it worked.

Dina: This tall grass is making me nervous.

Ellie: Yeah, they’re getting tricky to see.

[Ellie sees graffiti with a dark-haired woman and the inscription.]

Ellie: "Feel her love".

Dina: Huh. You think she’s related to the Wolves?

Ellie: I don’t know...

Dina: It’s kinda fuckin’ weird.

[They make their way through the city overgrown with fern and bushes.]

Dina: There’s the TV station.

Ellie: I don’t think we can get around this one...

Dina: Mmm... Hang on...

Ellie: Easy!

Dina: How else were we gonna get through? You think someone heard that?

Ellie: It was pretty loud... Keep your eyes peeled.

Ellie: Shit. Stay down there. These stairs are wired up.

Dina: Can you detonate them?

Ellie: Not here...

[She throws a brick at the wiring. The charge explodes.]

Dina: We’re not being subtle right now.

Ellie: Maybe Leah will come to us...

Dina: Yeah... or they might be waiting to ambush us.

Ellie: Ugh. Need to get in there... There it is. Stay low. Fuck.

Dina: Ugh, that’s brutal. Tommy do this?

Ellie: Let’s get inside.

Dina: Ellie, what about that? Holy...

Ellie: This is definitely not Tommy.

Dina: Who the fuck did this?

Ellie: I don’t know... But it’s a message.

Dina: This just happened. You think they’re still here?

Ellie: I hope not... But keep your eyes open.

Dina: Follow me.

Ellie: Shit.

Dina: Another body up there... I don’t like this... We’re too exposed.

Ellie: We have to search all of it. I want to find Leah.

Dina: Just... Be careful. You hear that?

Ellie: What is that?

[In one of the offices on the top floor of the building Ellie finds a girl’s corpse with a few arrows in her chest.]

Ellie: That’s her. Leah.

Dina: You sure?

Ellie: Yes.

Dina: Guess the universe really wanted her dead, huh? There’s nothing on her.

Radio: Six, this is Two, do you copy? Six, acknowledge, over.

Ellie: Dina.

Dina: Hmm?

Ellie: It’s all of them.

[In her hands, we see pictures of Abby’s group members.]

Dina: No, wait. That’s near Jackson.

Ellie: Look at their fucking smiles. (sees Abby’s picture) That’s her. That’s the one who killed him.

Dina: Three down, right?

Ellie: Three down.

Radio: Six, this is Two, do you copy? Support unit India en route to the TV station. Repeat, support unit India en route--

Dina: Shit.

Ellie: Yeah. We should get going.

Dina: Well... she’s dead. How do you feel?

Ellie: I’m pissed we couldn’t talk to her.

Dina: Yeah. But she didn’t hurt Joel. It would’ve been pretty fucked up to make her talk.

Ellie: She traveled hundreds of miles to torture him. I don’t care whether she held the club or not.

Dina: I get it.

Ellie: You wanna find somewhere to hole up? Look over Leah’s stuff?

Dina: For sure. Let’s head deeper into downtown. We can find a building to secure.

[The voices are heard from below.]

WLF Soldier: Keep your eyes open!

Dina: Get down!

WLF Soldier: Christ. They’re all dead! Fucking Scars killed ‘em!

WLF Soldier: Spread out. We still could have Scars in the building. Watch each other!

Dina: How are we getting out of here?

WLF Soldier: Someone get to the radio and call this in, now.

Ellie: On me.

WLF Soldier: What are you doing?

WLF Soldier: Cutting them down.

WLF Soldier: Make sure the building’s clear first.

WLF Soldier: I’m not leaving them up there!

WLF Soldier: The fuck’s cutting them down gonna do now? Go!

Dina: To our right. Downstairs.

Ellie: Shh. Quiet.

Dina: Behind you, behind you! Oh shit! To our right!

Ellie: Any still standing?

Dina: I don’t think so. I hear more. This way! Come on.

WLF Soldier: Oh shit! There!!

Dina: Ellie! C’mon! Fuck! Ellie! Through this window! C’mon!

Ellie: Oh fuck! Dina, we gotta run!

WLF Soldier: Trespassers! Over there!

WLF Soldier: Are they with the Scars?

WLF Soldier: I don’t fucking know, just shoot ‘em!

Dina: Don’t stop! We gotta lose them!

WLF Soldier: Dead ahead!

Ellie: Oh shit! All right.

Dina: It’ll work for now. Keep going.

WLF Soldier: Find a way in!

Dina: Spores ahead. Masks.

Ellie: Okay.

WLF Soldier: Where the hell’d they go?

WLF Soldier: Sal, call it in! The rest of you, pick this place apart!

WLF Soldier: Anything?!

WLF Soldier: Negative! Keep looking!

Dina: We gotta keep moving.

Ellie: I hope there’s a way through.

Dina: I thought they had us.

Ellie: I know.

Dina: Ellie!

WLF Soldier: Masks on! Sweep this entire station!

Ellie: God damn it.

WLF Soldier: So which is it? Are they Scars or trespassers?

WLF Soldier: What are you, deaf? Jo clearly said--

WLF Soldier: Quiet! Clickers. Watch yourselves.

WLF Soldier: The fuck do these trespassers matter? Scars just lynched, that whole unit! We should just leave them down here for the infected to eat.

WLF Soldier: They killed Mike, man. That’s reason enough

Dina: There’s a clicker. Behind us.

WLF Soldier: You hear they got Jordan, too?

WLF Soldier: No. Fuck.

Ellie: Dina.

Dina: Fuckin’ move it!

Ellie: Oof, shit!

Dina: Come on. Let’s go.

Ellie: Yeah.

Dina: Are you okay?

Ellie: Yeah. Thanks.

Dina: Babe... I’m really tired.

Ellie: Yeah, let’s get outta here. This way’s blocked.

Dina: Maybe through here... Did you hear what they kept calling us?

Ellie: Scars?

Dina: I wonder if that’s who made all those murals.

Ellie: And gutted all those Wolves.

Dina: Everyone in this city is a fucking psycho.

Ellie: No shit.

WLF Soldier: Oh god!!

(distant screams)

Ellie: The fuck?

Dina: What’s the plan?

Ellie: Got another ladder across there.

Dina: Okay... How do we get to it?

Ellie: That’ll do.

Ellie: Jesus.

Dina: Have you ever seen anything like this?

Ellie: Bloaters have acid spores... but that didn’t sound like a bloater. Whatever the fuck they’re fighting, we should let them kill each other.

Dina: Agreed.

Ellie: Ladder’s broken.

Dina: Damn it.

Ellie: Dina. This way.

WLF Soldier: Got another shambler! Just get out of here! Sal, watch out!!

WLF Soldier: Shit!

WLF Soldier: I got you, I got you!

WLF Soldier: Fuck, go, go!!

Ellie: Holy fuck...

Dina: I’ve never seen one of those.

Ellie: Me neither.

Dina: On your right.

Ellie: Ugh, fuck these assholes! Did they get you?

Dina: No. I’m clean. Shamblers... Is that what they called them?

Ellie: Yeah... Where the hell do shamblers come from?

Dina: I don’t fucking know... but they’re disgusting.

Ellie: Ugh. Look at those acid burns.

Dina: No, I’m good.

Ellie: Let’s see where this takes us. Take your time.

Dina: Almost... done. Okay. It looks clear... far as I can see.

Ellie: Good. Shamblers? As if the others weren’t bad enough.

Dina: I guess that’s nature for you.

Ellie: Yeah, well, nature is an asshole.

Ellie: Hey, doesn’t this look like the lady from the Scar graffiti?

Dina: Yeah.

Ellie: Let’s see... Yes.

Dina: How’d you do that?

Ellie: Magic.

Dina: You’re my favorite.

Ellie: (chuckle)

Ellie: Hmm.

Dina: There must be a way around.

Ellie: I like your optimism.

Ellie: Shit. Shamblers.

Dina: We got this.

Ellie: Watch out!

Dina: Get off! Ellie, help! Shit, watch out!

Ellie: Okay, I’m ready to get out of here.

Dina: Same. One sec. There.

Ellie: What the hell happened here?

Dina: I’m gonna say some kind of train crash.

Ellie: Thanks Sherlock. Jesus... I wonder how long they kept these running past Outbreak Day.

Dina: I see some light up that way.

Ellie: Up we go, then. Thank you. Dina?

Dina: Yeah... Coming.

Ellie: Getting closer to light. Hey. Lemme get you up there.

Dina: Yeah.

Ellie: Whatcha got?

Dina: C’mon. Okay, let’s rally.

Ellie: We’re almost out.

Dina: Lead on.

[The car inside which Ellie goes begins to slide into the abyss.]

Ellie: Oh no! Fuck!

Dina: Ellie! I’m coming!

[Deena runs to Ellie. An infected person attacks Ellie and breaks the glass in her mask with a blow.]

Dina: Get... off! Ellie, your mask! Here, we can share mine.

Ellie: No, no, no!

Dina: What?!

Ellie: Don’t take this off! Dina, stop!

Dina: Ellie--!

Ellie: Stop!

[She takes off the mask with a quick movement.]

Dina: What? No! Ellie, no!!

Ellie: Stop! I’m not infected! I’m immune. I’m not coughing, do you see? Fuck. Dina? Shit.

[They can hear the groans of the dead coming out of the tunnel.]

Ellie: Can you run?

Dina: Yeah. Yes.

Ellie: Let’s fucking go. Go!

[They run. Ellie manages to cut the heads of the advancing dead with an axe.]

Dina: Get!! Off!

Ellie: Run Dina!

Dina: Ellie?!

Ellie: I’m right here! Don’t slow down!

Dina: This way, hurry! Fuck! Go right! Come on!

Ellie: Go, go!

[They manage to get out into the metro lobby, leaving the dead behind the turnstiles. Dina falls to the floor with no strength left. Ellie helps her get up.]

Ellie: Dina! On your feet. Hey. What do you say we rest in that theater?

Dina: That sounds so fucking good.

Ellie: Almost there. I got you. Here. Got it?

[She takes Deena to a safe place and tries to open the door inside.]

Ellie: C’mon. All right, we’re good. C’mon.

[Ellie barricades the door and comes up to Dina.]

Ellie: You want to tell me what’s going on with you?

Dina: What’s going on with me? I just saw you breathe spores.

Ellie: I told you I’m immune.

Dina: Okay, you’re immune? Come on.

Ellie: I was bitten a long time ago...

Dina: What the fuck are you talking about?

Ellie: I was bitten and nothing happened.

Dina: The chemical burn...

Ellie: Maria and Tommy... and Joel are the only ones who know... Knew... Now you know. I can’t... get you infected, if that’s what you’re worried about. I can’t make you immune either. Can you say something?

Dina: Ellie... I think I’m pregnant.

Ellie: What?

Dina: Don’t worry, it’s not yours. (laughs)

Ellie: What are we su-- What are we supposed to do now?

Dina: Nothing. I just need to rest for a second.

Ellie: Are you fucking kidding me... How long have you known?

Dina: I was late a few weeks ago.

Ellie: A few weeks? We could’ve... we could’ve still turned back.

Dina: I didn’t know... I wasn’t sure, okay? I didn’t want to be a burden--

Ellie: Well, you’re a burden now, aren’t you? I’m gonna... make sure the place is secure. You just rest.

[Ellie goes to study the building where they found themselves.]

Ellie: (finds a flyer) Wonder how many people die in this play? (to herself) Pregnant... Fucking pregnant... How could you keep something like that? Okay... This note’s old. Still. Better be careful.

[It turns on the electricity and tries to configure the radio communication.]

Ellie: Damn. You get fried? Guess you weren’t much of an electrician. Got it. (finds a key) Ugh. What’s this? All right. (enters a luxury movie theater) Wow. Joel... You’d love watching a movie in this place.

[Behind the theater, Ellie discovers a back room full of mannequins.]

Ellie: Rad. Hmm, spooky. No way.

[She finds a guitar.]

Ellie: (singing)
If I ever were to lose you
I’d surely lose myself

[He puts her head on the guitar and plunges into memories.]

3 YEARS EARLIER
[Ellie learns to play guitar sitting on a log in the forest.]

Joel: That’s starting to sound like something.

Ellie: Ugh, I suck.

Joel: Nah... Just need to build up your calluses, that’s all.

Ellie: Yeah.

Joel: All right, c’mon.

Ellie: This it?

Joel: Yeah.

Ellie: Oh, shit! I’m gonna start guessing.

Joel: You want to spoil your surprise now?

Ellie: I dunno... Is it a dinosaur?

Joel: Stop trying to guess. I ain’t telling you.

Ellie: All right. Is it... an elephant?

Joel: Ugh...

Ellie: Is it a convertible?

Joel: More walkin’, less talkin’. Mind your step.

Ellie: I got it.

Joel: Oops. (laughs)

[He pushes Ellie into the river.]

Ellie: What is wrong with you?!

Joel: You should see your face right now.

Ellie: What if I drowned?

Joel: You’re not gonna drown. You gotta work on that confidence, kiddo.

Ellie: Yeah, keep laughing, old man. See what happens.

Joel: It’s this way.

Ellie: You’re the worst!

Joel: Your swimming’s getting better. Remember now, don’t just flail about, you gotta--

Ellie: “--push the water with your whole arm.” Blah blah blah.

Joel: Glad to know I’m getting through. Ellie, c’mere. Take a look at this. You see that deer over there? See it? Just through there, look.

Ellie: Where? Yeah. Yeah. I see it...

Joel: Yeah.

Ellie: Looks like...

[She pushes him into the river.]

Joel: Whoa!

Ellie: How’s that feel?

Joel: Refreshing.

Ellie: Yeah, it’s not nice getting pushed in, is it?

Joel: Well... Actually, we need to swim through this part anyway.

Ellie: I got you back, you’re angry and upset.

Joel: I am very angry and upset. Now come on.

Ellie: Ugh!

[Ellie jumps in the river. They swim slowly, passing the snags.]

Joel: You’re gonna need to dive under here. Take a deep breath.

Ellie: Yeah, I got this. Is it... my 6th grade history teacher wanting to apologize for being a massive dick?

Joel: I beg your pardon?

Ellie: My friend and I would argue whenever he called the Fireflies terrorists. We got a lot of detention.

Joel: You know, you really need to stop letting people rile you up.

Ellie: It’s hard when they’re dicks.

Joel: Point still stands. Another dive over here.

Ellie: Where are you taking me?

Ellie: Is it... a new pair of sneakers?

Joel: Here.

Ellie: Okay. Fuck it. I’m done guessing.

[They come out of the river and walk in the thickets.]

Joel: Oh, good.

Ellie: But like... is it a massive comic book collection... no, wait... a new DVD collection?

Joel: (sigh) Yes.

Ellie: Which one?

Joel: Just yes.

Ellie: How about laserdiscs. I heard that’s a thing.

[Ellie walks through tall grass and fallen trees. In the depths of the forest, in a small clearing, she notices the statue of a tyrannosaurus.]

Ellie: Holy shit, Joel.

Joel: We’re here.

Ellie: Oh my god, it is a dinosaur!

Joel: That it is.

Ellie: Joel!

Joel: Surprise.

Ellie: Holy shit... It’s a motherfucking dinosaur!

[She reads the inscription under the statue and makes an entry in her diary.]

Ellie: "King of the tyrant lizards." That’s a big boy.

[They enter a museum almost completely absorbed by plants. At the entrance, Ellie picks up a flyer with the title "Giants of the Past".]

Ellie: What’s this?

Joel: Uh. It’s a book.

Ellie: It’s a dinosaur book!

Joel: Okay?

Ellie: All right. (reads the flyer) Compsognathus. That’s a big name for little guys.

[She finds The Nighthawk card.]

Ellie: Oh cool.

Joel: Whatcha got there?

Ellie: These superhero cards... seems like they were popular.

Joel: I think Sarah was into those for a while. Or was it those little creature things. I forget.

Ellie: (reads the flyer) The dimetrodon was an apex predator.

Joel: What’s an apex predator?

Ellie: The most badass predator.

Joel: Hm. Pretty short for that.

Ellie: Wait, were you talking about me? Did you go to museums a lot?

Joel: Yeah. Yeah, Sarah loved them. I swear that girl dragged me to every damned museum in Texas.

[They enter the planetarium.]

Ellie: (gasps) Did you know this was here?!

Joel: You don’t like it. We can head back.

Ellie: Shut up!

[She comes to the stand and twists the handle, making the planets spin.]

Ellie: Whoa! Hey Joel, can you name all the planets?

Joel: My very educated mother just served us nice pizzas.

Ellie: Uhh... did you just have a stroke?

Joel: My: Mercury, very: Venus, mother: Mars--

Ellie: Ohh, okay. I get it. That’s pretty cool.

[Ellie sits in a lunar rover.]

Ellie: Fuck yeah.

Joel: Where’s the steering wheel?

Ellie: Rovers don’t use steering wheels. They use joysticks.

Joel: Huh. Hang on. Is this the real one?

Ellie: Considering they left the real ones on the moon, I would say no. What’s this way?

Joel: We can’t leave here yet. Still a lotta stuff to explore.

Ellie: Shit, okay.

[She finds the suit of an astronaut, takes the helmet and puts it on.]

Ellie: So cool.

Joel: How’s it smell in there?

Ellie: Like space! And dust.

[In the center of the room Ellie discovers the lunar module. She opens the hatch.]

Ellie: Whoa!

Joel: After you. Watch your head.

[They sit in the module. Ellie plays with buttons and levers.]

Ellie: Whoa! What the heck!

Joel: Okay.

Ellie: Bwwooh, bwwooh, bwwooh!

Joel: Wow.

Ellie: Ssheww! Wow!

Joel: Would you look at all these buttons.

Ellie: It’s so badass. Man... Could you imagine just... Brrrrvvvvoooaaahh!

[Joel pulls an audio cassette out of his pocket.]

Joel: Happy birthday, kiddo.

Ellie: What is this?

Joel: This is a thing that took a mighty effort to find. Take it.

[Ellie picks up the tape, takes out her player and, with the helmet off, plugs the headphones into her ears.]

Joel: Close your eyes. It’ll be worth it.

Ellie: ‘Kay.

[The voice of the dispatcher is recorded on the tape during the space shuttle.]

Dispatcher: Mission Control: Thirty seconds and counting. Astronauts report it feels good. T-minus twenty-five seconds. Twenty seconds and counting. T-minus fifteen seconds, guidance is internal. 12,11,10,9… Ignition sequence starts. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. All engine running. Liftoff! We have a liftoff! Thirty-two minutes past the hour, liftoff on Apollo 11.

[Ellie imagines that she is really involved in the launch of the space shuttle. She smiles with her eyes closed.]

Joel: I do okay?

Ellie: Are you fucking kidding me?

[They laugh.]

Joel: You’re welcome, kiddo. Whaddya say we keep looking around, huh?

Ellie: Yeah, I guess.

Joel: Yeah.

Ellie: Bwwooh!

[They come out of the module.]

Joel: Hey. Welcome to Earth.

Ellie: Yeah!

[He gives her a badge with a space shuttle and the moon.]

Joel: Here.

Ellie: There’s more museum stuff over there.

Joel: I never checked out that building.

Ellie: Let’s go!

Joel: And just how do you plan on getting yourself over there?

[Not really thinking about the consequences Ellie jumps from the second floor into the water.]

Ellie: Aaahh!

Joel: Ellie, god! You ever give anyone else this much grief?

Ellie: Get down here!

Joel: No!

Ellie: Hey, whose birthday is it?

Joel: You can’t keep doing that!

Ellie: I want a good splash! We’ve got more exploring to do!

Joel: Geronimo!

Ellie: Nice.

[They swim to the second building of the museum.]

Ellie: Hey! Boost me in there.

Joel: Yeah, I don’t know...

Ellie: I’ll open the door for you. Come on, we can’t chicken out now!

Joel: All right. There!

[Ellie gets inside.]

Ellie: Okay, bad news. There’s shit blocking the door!

Joel: Well, see if you can find me another way in. I’ll walk around the outside!

Ellie: Okay, be safe!

Joel: You be safe!

Ellie: There are dinosaurs around! It’s dark in here... Shit. (gasp) Come out, fucker… (sees stuffed wolves) Ah! Stupid fake animals. Shit.

[She is attacked by a real animal - a wild boar.]

Joel: Ellie!

Ellie: I’m in here!

[Joel bursts into the room, breaking the door with his shoulder.]

Joel: The hell was that?

Ellie: It’s just some animal.

Joel: Well, let’s get a move on. I want to get a fire going before it gets too dark. C’mon.

SEATTLE DAY 2
[Ellie wakes up in the back room.]

Radio: (radio static)

Dina: (retching)

[Ellie gets back to her girlfriend. She is repairing the radio.]

Dina: Hey. How hot do I look right now?

Ellie: Pretty hot. How’d you fix it?

Dina: It was a loose connection… Antenna. They found our mess at the school.

Ellie: Good.

Dina: This guy... (points at the picture) Owen. He went AWOL. South Lake.

Ellie: Maybe Tommy got to him.

Dina: Maybe.

Ellie: What about her?

Dina: Nothing yet.

Radio: Unit Romeo, you are requested at site Two. Repeat. You are requested at site Two. Confirm.

Dina: So, the numbers are locations. The TV station we were at? That’s Six. There’s a lot of chatter coming out of Two, so I’m assuming that’s their home base... That helps.

Ellie: Look... last night was... stupid.

Dina: Yeah.

Radio: Casualties reported in Fourteen. All available units report. Over. This is site Thirteen. Unit Lima nearby How many Scars you got? Over. Negative on Scars. Lone male trespasser. Armed. Over.

Dina: Lone male trespasser?

Ellie: Tommy. Where’s Fourteen?

Dina: I’m not 100% sure...

Ellie: Okay, then guess.

Dina: Well... If this is Seven... 3 Twelve’s all the way over here. I guess it’s somewhere in this neighborhood?

Ellie: Hillcrest. Okay.

[They are coming out of their hideout. Dina gets sick.]

Dina: Whew.

Dina: Yeah. Not good.

Ellie: Hey. I’ll go get him. You keep tracking them, okay?

Dina: Yeah, okay. Wait. Gimme your hand. (ties a bracelet around her wrist) It’s for good luck.

Ellie: I don’t believe in luck.

Dina: I do.

[They kiss and Ellie leaves.]

Ellie: Okay, Hillcrest. Is this the right place? Definitely the right place. (hears a gunshots) That’s gotta be Tommy. Shit.

[She begins to explore the neighborhood.]

Ellie: How do I get up there? Shit! There’s too many of these assholes. Hold on, Tommy.

[Having jumped into the dilapidated and overgrown old building, she can hear the WLF soldiers behind the wall.]

WLF Soldier: This is dumb, we should be pushing in.

WLF Soldier: We hold the perimeter until we hear otherwise. Keep an eye out in case he comes this way.

WLF Soldier: I got something!

Ellie: Shit!

WLF Soldier: Infected?

WLF Soldier: Let’s get in there.

[They enter the building. Ellie is hiding. A dog enters the room with the soldiers.]

WLF Soldier: Smell something in there, girl? You think this guy’s connected to the girl from the school?

WLF Soldier: It’d be a hell of coincidence if they weren’t.

WLF Soldier: I hate these small groups... Big groups, it’s a straight fight. These loners, they could be hiding anywhere.

WLF Soldier: I hear you.

[Ellie sneaks up on a separated soldier and kills him with a knife.]

Ellie: Shh. Quiet. God...

WLF Soldier: Sweep the whole goddamn street.

[A fierce fight begins.]

Ellie: All right. Fuck. God damn. Shit. Shut it. Ahh! Okay. Fuck.

[Ellie manages to defeat the soldiers.]

Ellie: Anybody hear that? That worked. Huh... an actual tattoo shop. (a pack of undead attacks her) What the fuck?! The fuck was that? (cracks a safe) Oh shit... it worked. Looks like they’ve been locked in here for years. Shit. Shamblers. Done. Ugh, that smell... I hate shamblers. Ugh. Not another one... Just in case. Nice shots... Whoa. What was that? (notices smoke in the distance) Oh shit. Hope you did that, Tommy. Down you go. Ahh! Fuck! Get off me! Yeah. This’ll do. (finds a bow) Oh. (tries to shoot) That’s one way to use mannequins... Let’s see. All right... Still got it. (notices some WLF) Oh, fuck me.

WLF Soldier: Hey! We got another trespasser. A girl! Did you see her?!

WLF Soldier: No. But the fucking guy is nearby.

WLF Soldier: Shit.

WLF Soldier: We’re looking for two!

WLF Soldier: The fuck’s all that smoke?

WLF Soldier: He blew up one of our trucks.

WLF Soldier: How’d you let that happen?

WLF Soldier: Just... find them. I want those fucking trespassers!

[She kills the dog with her bow and starts quietly killing the others.]

Ellie: God. Just shut up. Fuck… Don’t. Just shut up. Shut up. All right. Shut it. Shut the fuck up. God damn...

WLF Soldier: I want every building in the area searched!

Ellie: Got you. Shh. Quiet. Quiet. Shh. Shut up. Shh. Quiet. Fuckin’ shut up. Shut your mouth. Just shut up. Shut the fuck up.

Ellie: How do I get out of here...? Maybe I can get out through there.

WLF Soldier: Let’s check around here.

WLF Soldier: Why are so many squads getting pulled in for one trespasser?

WLF Soldier: ‘Cause of the fucking school and the TV station.

WLF Soldier: I thought that was Scars.

WLF Soldier: Think these trespassers might be working with them. Don’t drop your guard.

WLF Soldier: He’s here! Saw him go into that house! Get in there! Go!

WLF Soldier: They found him! Should we go help?

WLF Soldier: No. She’s here! Hold your ground!

Ellie: Shh. Quiet. Shut up. Shut it. Okay...

WLF Soldier: See anything?

WLF Soldier: Nothing yet.

WLF Soldier: The fuck is going on with these trespassers?

WLF Soldier: Let’s get one alive and find out.

WLF Soldier: Fuck that. Don’t take any chances.

Ellie: Shut it. Shh. Quiet. There...

WLF Soldier: I saw him! He went down that street! Hey! He’s not getting past us! Find him!

WLF Soldier: Over here!

Ellie: No! Fuck! WLF Soldier: By the fence!

WLF Soldier: She dropped in there!

WLF Soldier: Smoke her out!

WLF Soldier: Go! Go! Go!

Ellie: Fuck! God.

WLF Soldier: He’s over there!

WLF Soldier: Trespasser in here!

WLF Soldier: Go!

WLF Soldier: Help!

WLF Soldier: Go! Go! Don’t let him escape!

WLF Soldier: We’ve got them surrounded! Close in!

[When Ellie jumps off a tall building, someone grabs her from the back, closing her from the palm. Several WLF cars pass by.]

Man: Shh, shh!

Ellie: What the hell are you doing here?

Jesse: Think I’d let you do this on your own?

Ellie: Jesse...

Jesse: Where’s Dina?

Ellie: She’s safe. She’s just sick.

Jesse: What kind of sick?

Ellie: She’s fine.

WLF Soldier: Fan out! She went that way!

Jesse: Christ, there’s a lot of them.

Ellie: Hey, how hurt are you?

Jesse: I’ll be okay. Your friends out there rushed me. No warning, no nothing.

Ellie: Tell me you didn’t come alone.

Jesse: Gimme shit about it later.

Ellie: You’re a fucking idiot, you know that, right?

Jesse: Yeah.

WLF Soldier: (muffled shouting)

Jesse: All right. See that truck?

Ellie: That’s your plan?

Jesse: We need to get some distance.

Ellie: Okay.

Jesse: You ready?

Ellie: Yeah. Hey, be smart about it.

WLF Soldier: Okay. The hell are we searching for?

WLF Soldier: Trespasser.

Jesse: I got the one on the left.

Ellie: Shh. Shut up. Fuck.

WLF Soldier: By the fence!

Jesse: That’s right.

WLF Soldier: What the fuck’s going on?

Jesse: Ellie! Got the keys. Let’s go!

WLF Soldier: Let’s go!

Jesse: Get in!

[They get into the truck. Jesse tries to start the engine.]

Ellie: Okay.

Jesse: Shit.

WLF Soldier: The car!

Ellie: Give it some gas.

Jesse: I am!

Ellie: Give it more!

Jesse: Come on, come on...

Ellie: Jesse, get us the fuck out of here!

Jesse: I’m trying! Yes-- Ahh!

[He starts the car but one of the soldiers pulls him out of the window.]

Ellie: Jesse!

Jesse: Jesus.

Ellie: Watch out!

WLF Soldier: Get the tires! Don’t let them get away!

Jesse: Hang on!

Ellie: Go, go!

[Adrenaline chase begins with WLF soldiers, who ride next to the heroes and shoot them.]

WLF Soldier: Get ‘em!

Jesse: Shit!

Ellie: Got one!

Jesse: Keep going!

WLF Soldier: Shoot the damn tires!

Ellie: Keep it steady!

Jesse: Ellie! Take out the driver!

Ellie: Look out! Go, go!

[Having destroyed the soldiers, they are carved into a tree. Jesse kicks down the cracked windshield. They are attacked by dead people.]

Jesse: You gotta be kidding me... come on!

Ellie: Oh my god...!!

[Jesse is trying to drive away.]

Jesse: Damn it! Get off!

Ellie: Motherfucker!

[In a crazy race and fighting with the dead they fall with the car into the river.]

Jesse: Shit. Shit!

[They swim ashore.]

Ellie: Oh god! You okay?

Jesse: Never better.

Ellie: Okay. I think we’re in the clear. Here. C’mon.

Jesse: Thanks.

Ellie: This way.

Jesse: Okay.

[They go to the movie theater, to Dina.]

Ellie: Dina!

[They hug.]

Dina: Hey. Oh my god. Jesse.

Jesse: Hey, Dina. Oh!

Dina: Hey. You okay?

Jesse: Nothin’ a little sleep won’t take care of.

Ellie: We should get inside.

Dina: Yeah, okay, come on. Easy. How’d you get past Maria?

Jesse: I had to sneak out. My friends’ problems are my problems. I heard you’re sick?

Dina: Oh, it’s... it’s just a stomach thing. C’mon. Let’s sit you down, huh. No, no, no.

[She helps him take off his sneakers.]

Jesse: You don’t need to do that.

Dina: Oh, shut up. So, when’d you leave Jackson?

Jesse: Day after you, but there was bad snow when I crossed into Oregon. I’ve been doing eighteen hour stretches for the past two weeks trying to catch up.

Dina: Yeah? Now you’re just bragging.

[Ellie leaves the room.]

2 YEARS EARLIER
[Ellie remembers going hunting with Tommy.]

Tommy: (muffled voice)

Ellie: Huh?

Tommy: Are you with me?

Ellie: Yeah. Yeah, I’m good.

Tommy: Okay. Anyway, this silent treatment... Man! I mean, I’d forget my own birthday if she didn’t remind me when it was.

Ellie: You should just apologize to her.

Tommy: I just said-- Okay... What’s going on?

Ellie: Nothing. Why?

Tommy: I can tell when you’re off.

Ellie: Got some stuff on my mind.

Tommy: You let me know if you want to talk about it.

Ellie: Okay

Tommy: Got stragglers.

Ellie: How many?

Tommy: Just a handful.

Tommy: You wanna give it a whirl?

Ellie: Are you sure?

Tommy: I’m feeling generous. See that sign there? Red one? Try hitting that. Good way to draw ‘em out of wherever they’re hiding. Gotta aim higher. Leave the bullet room to drop.

Ellie: I see...

Tommy: There you go!

Ellie: Sound’s attracting them.

Tommy: Well, we are on patrol, Let’s clear ‘em out.

[Ellie shoots some undead with Tommy’s sniper rifle.]

Ellie: Shit.

Tommy: Make sure to compensate for the bullet drop. Take your time. There you go. See a few more.

Ellie: Gotcha. I like this thing...

Tommy: Two left.

Ellie: Ugh.

Tommy: That’s all of them. Usually more over this way if you wanna keep shootin’.

Ellie: Okay. Where are they coming from?

Tommy: Hordes like to move through this area in winter. They always end up leaving behind a few stragglers.

Ellie: They do the same routes every year?

Tommy: Like a migration or something.

Ellie: What’s that about?

Tommy: Well... When the barometric pressure reaches a certain... temperature. shit, I don’t fuckin’ know. Check out the shed. Looks like they’re moving downhill...

Ellie: Why?

Tommy: Mmm... Dead animal. Look up by the truck there. They’re munching on that deer there. Guess they’re hungry.

[Ellie shoots them.]

Tommy: You’re a natural.

Ellie: Oh!

Tommy: No rush. You’ll find it.

Ellie: Whatcha think?

Tommy: Beautiful. Spotting two still. You’re really getting it.

Ellie: Yes.

Tommy: I’m impressed. Looks clear. Bet there’s some this way. That something by the ski lifts? Look way out there. Under those gondolas. By that tower. You see it?

Ellie: Come on.

Tommy: Well done! Handful more. Gonna have to tell Joel about this. Couple more out there. Try again. Hope Joel’s been stirring that stew. Probably just left it to burn on the bottom. I’m not seeing any more.

Ellie: Yeah, me neither.

Tommy: All right, let’s head in. See if Joel’s back.

Ellie: Sure.

[Finished with the dead, Ellie returns the sniper rifle to Tommy.]

Tommy: Hand her over.

[They go into the forest.]

Ellie: Hey, thanks for that. It was just what I needed.

Tommy: Sure. Ladies first. I’m not supposed to say anything... But Joel’s worried about you.

Ellie: There’s nothing to worry about.

Tommy: I’m sure there isn’t... But if you don’t talk to him, he’s going to think something’s wrong.

Ellie: I talk to him.

Tommy: You have to do more than hi and bye...

Ellie: Okay. I will try.

[They go back to Joel’s forest hut. Joel himself sits on a chair by the bar with a guitar in his hands.]

Joel: That was y’all shootin’ out there, right?

Tommy: Oh, just some stragglers. Ellie got to try out my scope.

Joel: How’d you like it?

Ellie: Yeah. It feels good.

Joel: I see you’ve, uh... you haven’t gotten around to changing the strings yet.

Ellie: I didn’t know I was supposed to.

Joel: Yeah, you-uh... We’ll get you some new ones.

[Tommy takes Joel’s guitar.]

Tommy: There’s that music store down there. I bet they got guitar stuff. I mean, that area’s long overdue for a sweep anyway. I can keep watch.

Joel: What do you say, kiddo?

Ellie: Sure.

Joel: And that’s our cue.

Tommy: (chuckles)

Ellie: You sure you don’t wanna come?

Tommy: Get on, now. He’s waiting.

Ellie: Okay, let’s go.

Joel: All right. On me, kiddo.

[They get on the horses and ride into the forest.]

Joel: So... you and Tommy cross anything when you was out?

Ellie: Just the few we saw from the ridge. You?

Joel: Oh, you know... Found two runners in a house. Jesse tells me you’re handling your own quite well on the group patrols. He was even recommending you for paired patrols. I think you’re still a bit young for it.

Ellie: I’m a better shot than almost all of them. And I have more experience than most of the new recruits who--

Joel: Look... If you think you’re ready. I trust you.

Ellie: Okay. Thanks.

Joel: Just do me a favor and start with the shorter routes for now. Y’know. See how you handle them.

Ellie: All right.

Joel: You remember those Savage Starlight comic books that you’re into?

Ellie: Yeah.

Joel: Tommy and I found some when we were moving through that school the other day.

Ellie: Didja like ‘em?

Joel: Oh you know, it’s not really my cup of tea. Dr. Daniela Star is pretty...

Ellie: She’s a savage.

Joel: What she does to Captain Ryan in that death match--

Ellie: Yeah. I mean... He definitely deserved it, but...

Joel: It was a nice twist how they escaped, though.

Ellie: You’re funny.

Joel: Music store’s up that way... We’re gonna have to leave the horses here.

Ellie: Yeah. Sounds good.

Joel: There’s that music store.

Ellie: Yeah, I see it.

Joel: Need a boost?

Ellie: I got it. Uh, I don’t think we can go this way.

Joel: What? Damn. Used to be able to swim across this...

Ellie: Okay, so... now what?

Joel: Well, if you’re up for it, we can try cutting through that hotel.

Ellie: I’m up for it. Found a rare hero card right in that ditch.

Joel: You still collecting those things?

Ellie: Don’t be jealous.

Joel: I’ll do my damndest.

Ellie: (tries the door) Damn it.

Joel: Oh, that might be somethin’. You think you can fit in there?

Ellie: It’s worth a shot.

[He lifts the snag and Ellie gets into the building.]

Joel: Careful now.

Ellie: Yep. I’m through! Hold on!

Joel: All right. See anything?

Ellie: Mmm.... looking.

[She finds a way to open the door.]

Ellie: Well, hello.

Joel: Howdy.

Ellie: You impressed?

Joel: Nope. You’re just too skinny, you need to eat more.

Ellie: You’re welcome!

Joel: Ellie, here.

Ellie: This place is giving me the creeps.

Joel: I think I see a way through, but we got spores. Put your mask on.

Ellie: Do I have to?

Ellie: Do I have to? It’s just us.

Joel: What if we run into someone?

Ellie: Okay, fine.

Joel: You gotta be smart about this. You stop wearing that mask, kiddo, and eventually you’re going to slip up in front of someone you shouldn’t.

Ellie: I’ve never slipped.

Joel: You ain’t told nobody new, have you? Not Jesse or Dina or--

Ellie: Of course not.

Joel: ‘Kay, good.

Ellie: You ever been in here before?

Joel: No. We’ve just patrolled the streets. Feeling like a bit of an oversight now...

Ellie: Maybe.

Joel: Looks like it was shot awhile back.

Ellie: When’d the last patrol go through here?

Joel: Not sure.

Ellie: Is it one of us?

Joel: Nah. Only people went missing from Jackson are them teenagers from last year. This one’s too old. Probably just roamed in. This way. Ellie, c’mere.

Ellie: We are on patrol, right?

Joel: Okay. Let’s take ‘em out.

[They quietly kill all the dead in the room.]

Ellie: Joel... I think we did it.

Joel: Think so. Good job, kiddo.

Ellie: Yeah. You too. So... what do you say we give up on those strings for today?

Joel: Couldn’t have said it better myself. But I think our only way out is forward now...

[He goes through the empty space between the walls.]

Joel: That looks like it might be something.

Ellie: Following you. (gasps)

[Ellie is dragged through the wall by a huge evil mushroom dead man. She and Joel fight it off.]

Joel: Ellie! Come on! Hey! Over here! Hey! Stay away from her!

[In the end, Joel hacks the creature with a few swings of his machete.]

Joel: C’mon.

Ellie: Shit.

Joel: That was too close.

Ellie: Sure... but we fucking did it.

Joel: We sure did.

Ellie: You good?

Joel: Other than being really old? Ain’t nothing a solid night of sleep won’t shake off.

Ellie: I wanna get out of here. What are you doing? What if there’s like two bloaters back there?

Joel: It’ll be fine. Spores are clear.

Ellie: Quite the fight back there, huh?

Joel: Not often we get a bloater around these parts.

Ellie: Yeah... Jesse and Dina are going to lose their shit when they hear about this.

Joel: What’s the deal with them two anyway? They’re dating, right?

Ellie: On and off. Why?

Joel: I hear the way Jesse talks about you.

Ellie: No. Jesse and I are just friends.

Joel: Now, now, now, I’ve got a pretty keen eye for these sort of things.

Ellie: Not so keen with this one.

Joel: We’ll see.

Ellie: Don’t hold your breath.

Joel: You think you can squeeze through there? See what it is?

Ellie: Yeah. Okay.

[She finds a long-dried corpse lying on the floor. A dead man crawls to Ellie from behind the crates.]

Joel: Ellie!

[He kills the dead.]

Ellie: Shit. Thanks.

Joel: Yeah.

Ellie: Hey, Joel.

Joel: Huh?

Ellie: I think it’s them. The couple that ran away last year.

Joel: I think you’re right.

[Ellie takes a letter from the table and reads it.]

Ellie: “Jackson is a wonderful place, but we got tired of hearing the stories of people suffering everywhere else. We wanted to save lives. We had good intentions. We didn’t make it an hour before running into a horde. Now we’re bitten. We’ve decided we’re going to end our lives instead of turning. Please tell our family and friends that we’re sorry. Love, Adam and Sidney”

[She flips the letter.]

Ellie: “I shot her. I can’t take my own life. I’m a fucking coward. Adam”

Joel: Jesus.

Ellie: If only they were immune, right?

Joel: Well. Let’s... Let’s go get Tommy, and we can get these bodies back to Jackson.

Ellie: After you took me out of the Firefly hospital, you said there were dozens of people like me.

Joel: Yeah. Yeah, that’s what they told me.

Ellie: I’ve never met another immune person before. Have you?

Joel: They could be hiding it. You do.

Ellie: Do you believe that?

Joel: Is now really the time for this?

Ellie: We traveled across the entire country to bring me to the Fireflies... I had so many questions for them. Why did you pull me out of there while I still unconscious?

Joel: Because I let them run their tests, and when I saw that they were useless, I got us out of there--

Ellie: How do you know they were useless? Maybe if you just woulda given them more time, they could have figured something out--

Joel: Ellie! There was no cure. There’s nothing that could’ve helped these people or anybody else. I know you wish things were different -- I wish things were different. But they ain’t. We need to get these kids back to their families. Or is there somethin’ else you’d like to rehash?

Ellie: No.

Joel: Good. C’mon.

[We go back to the present. Ellie sutures the wound on her arm. Dina enters the room.]

Dina: Jesse’s passed out. Hey... let me do that.

Ellie: He’s a good guy.

Dina: Mm-hmm.

Ellie: Why didn’t you tell him?

Dina: Wasn’t the right time. (kisses the stitches) There you go.

Ellie: What about this? Anything worthwhile?

Dina: Uh... Actually, yeah.

Ellie: Abby?

Dina: Uh, no. This girl... Nora. Her unit was assigned to this hospital. They were collecting supplies or something.

Ellie: (pointing on the map) This hospital?

Dina: Yeah. Wait, you’re going to go now?

Ellie: Yeah, we have a lead.

Dina: Like, at least just wait for Jesse to rest up.

Ellie: She could be gone by then.

Dina: Ellie.

Ellie: We know her location. Maybe Tommy does too. What?

Dina: Nothing.

Ellie: Good. Can you come help me with the door please?

Dina: Yep.

[Ellie leaves the theater.]

Ellie: Right. If I follow Route 5, that should take me to the hospital. Follow Route Five. Track down Nora... Get her to tell me where Abby is... Easy... Here we go. Gotta get through... Okay. Progress. God damn it... All right...

[She notices graffiti on the wall.]

Ellie: "Feel her love." What the fuck...?

[She continues to explore abandoned buildings.]

Ellie: Hmm. All right, what do we got? And there we go. Yes.

[In one of the buildings Ellie discovers a workbench and, as usual, decides to check her guns, when suddenly she hears someone shouting from behind.  The man grabs Ellie and presses her against the workbench.]

WLF Soldier: Got her! I got her! We’re not going back, understand?!

Ellie: Let go of me!

WLF Soldier: Kill her!

[Ellie stabs him.]

Ellie: Okay.

WLF Soldier: Isaac can go to hell! We’re not going back!

[Ellie kills some more WLF.]

Ellie: Eat shit... Jesus... What the fuck, people?!

[She continues to explore.]

Ellie: (finds a chemistry book) Hmm... interesting... Ugh. You thought I was a Wolf? Gotta be more careful... Let’s see what they’ve got in here. Shit. Need to get in there. All right... Ugh. (the door closes tightly) Ahh! Damn it. (uses a crate to hold the door) C’mon, c’mon, c’mon...! Man... Nearly had it... Go, go...! Yes. That actually worked. That was pretty smart, Ellie… Okay... There’s the hospital. Fuck... I thought I’d be closer. Nice. Eugh. Stinks in here. Oh...! Fucking Wolf. Serves you right. Oh shit--! Fuck me. They really got you... Great... Stalkers. They’re not following me. Man, that sucked. There’s the hospital... Not much farther... Felt that. Can’t get to the street from here. Gotta go back in. Okay... head down to the street... Down your go. Okay... time to go. Gotta be a way out of here... Here we go. Oh, shit! Ahh! Get offa me!

[She enters the room with the closed door. She is surrounded by dead people. Ellie tries to break the lock as soon as possible, and then holds the door to prevent the dead from catching her. One of the dead eventually breaks through and throws Ellie out the window into the water. Fighting for her life, she swims into the sewers.]

Ellie: Fuck Seattle. There’s my way out. Get me the hell out of here. All right. Where the hell did I end up? Okay. You are here... and the hospital’s there. Cut through the park...

**strange whistles**

***WHISTLE!!!***

[An arrow will hit Ellie’s shoulder.]

Ellie: Shit. Who the fuck...?

[She quietly kills the whistling hunters.]

Ellie: Quiet. Shh. Shut up. Yeah... Shh. Shut up. All right. Holy shit. Shut it. Don’t. Jesus... these must be the Scars... Doesn’t matter... Hospital... You better not have strung Nora up... Okay... here’s the road to the hospital...

[She finds a way into Garden Suits.]

Ellie: All right. (sliding between buildings) Think I can fit...

[Having got out into the forest, she hears a voice in the distance.]

WLF Soldier: No! Please! Don’t do this!

Ellie: Damn it...

WLF Soldier: Isaac’s planning something. I’ll tell you about it. Just... Just let me--! Listen--!

Seraphite: They are nested with sin.

WLF Soldier: I didn’t want this!

Seraphite: Free them...

WLF Soldier: Holy shit!

Seraphite: That they may know my love!

WLF Soldier: No, don’t!! Ahh!!

[Fanatics hang a soldier on an electric pole.]

Ellie: Oh shit... Jesus.

Seraphite: Now he is free.

Seraphite: Now he is free.

Seraphite: Search for stragglers.

Seraphite: May she guide us. Did you hear what Lily did?

Seraphite: I did. Shameful. But not all that surprising.

Seraphite: Her sister, though... I was shocked.

Seraphite: Their poor mother.

Seraphite: She should have sensed that something was off, though.

Ellie: Quiet.

[It sneaks through the fanatics walking in the forest.]

Ellie: Shh. Shut up. Shut it. Motherfucker...

[They notice her.]

Seraphite: Straggler! Get the Wolf!

Ellie: Fuck.

[She pulls out her gun.]

Ellie: God damn.

Seraphite: The sounds came from over here!

Seraphite: Keep eyes for stragglers!

Ellie: Shh. Quiet.

Seraphite: Seems we weren’t as thorough as we thought.

Ellie: Fucker...

Seraphite: They’re here. Somewhere.

Seraphite: Let’s set them free.

Ellie: All right... Okay... did I lose them...? Okay... You motherfucker! Got you, you motherfucker! Better still be there, Nora. Hmm. (cracks a safe) What’ve you got for me?

[Ellie descends into the sewers and quietly swims down the gutter.]

WLF Soldier: Did you find her yet?

Ellie: Shit...

WLF Soldier: She escaped while no one was looking. We’re searching the area... just in case she’s still around.

WLF Soldier: Isaac’s not happy about it.

WLF Soldier: No shit.

Ellie: Escape? Who the fuck are they talking about?

[She notices a girl sitting on the box and, sneaking up on her, takes her hostage.]

Ellie: Don’t make a fucking sound. Hands up.

[The girl has a PS Vita in the hands! Judging by the sounds she played in Hotline Miami.]

WLF Soldier: Easy... easy...

Ellie: You know a girl named Nora?

WLF Soldier: Sure, yeah.

Ellie: Where is she?

WLF Soldier: In the hospital.

Ellie: Where in the hospital?

WLF Soldier: They’re c-clearing out the upper floors. She’s somewhere in there.

[The girl tries to resist and Ellie stabs a knife down her throat.]

Ellie: Fuck. That was dumb.

[Ellie comes to the surface and hears the soldiers passing by.]

WLF Soldier: Boat’s away. Word is we’re almost wrapped up.

WLF Soldier: Good. I got my girl waiting for me at the FOB.

WLF Soldier: Are you shitting me? They put you with Jo again?

Ellie: Gotta get upstairs.

WLF Soldier: Hey, we get the job done.

WLF Soldier: Psh. I bet you do... this is not fair.

WLF Soldier: I’m telling you man... date a soldier... it makes these shifts so much easier.

WLF Soldier: Sure... I’ll keep that in mind.

WLF Soldier: Fuck, Sounds like Scars are getting closer.

WLF Soldier: Hope that’s our guys executing those freaks.

Ellie: (killing) Quiet.

WLF Soldier: Hey. Did you hear why we’re all getting called up to the FOB?

WLF Soldier: I heard that Isaac wants us to retake all of downtown

WLF Soldier: I heard we might take the fight to them.

WLF Soldier: No way. Not after what went down last time. Even Isaac isn’t that crazy

WLF Soldier: It’s what I heard.

WLF Soldier: Am I crazy, or are we a few people light?

WLF Soldier: Whitney’s probably hiding with her game thing.

WLF Soldier: No, I mean this is taking all day. There should’ve been at least two more units assigned to move this much inventory.

WLF Soldier: I know India was inbound.

Ellie: (killing) Shut it. (killing) Fuck you... (killing) Go to hell... (killing) Quiet.

WLF Soldier: Got something, Bear?

Ellie: (hears music) That you, Nora?

[SHe crawls the ventilation shaft.]

Nora: Maybe if you posted more guards, Abby would still be in her cell.

Ellie: When the fuck was Abby here?

WLF Soldier: I’m not stupid. You’re going to tell us where she went.

WLF Soldier: When Isaac talks to us about this... I’m going to say what I think happened.

Nora: Knock yourself out. I’ve got work to do.

WLF Soldier: Nora! I’m not going down for her, man.

WLF Soldier: Don’t worry. Isaac will get it out of her.

[Ellie finds a black girl named Nora. She points a gun at her.]

Ellie: Don’t scream. Put that shit down. You remember me? Yeah. You remember me.

Nora: What do you want?

Ellie: Abby was here earlier. Where’d she go?

Nora: I don’t know. You shoot me... the sound will have every soldier come running.

Ellie: You’ll still be dead. Tell me where she went and I’ll think about letting you go.

Nora: We could have killed you.

Ellie: Maybe you should have. Or maybe you should’ve stayed the fuck out of Jackson. Where’s Abby?

Nora: You still hear his screams?

Ellie: What?

Nora: I hear them every night... Yeah. Yeah, that little bitch got what he deserved.

Ellie: You fucking cunt--

[Ellie wants to hit Nora, but she hits her with a tray and runs away.]

Nora: Help! Trespasser! Somebody! Please! Over here!

[Ellie runs after her.]

Ellie: Nora! You can’t escape this! Damn it!

Nora: Shoot her!

WLF Soldier: Stop!

Ellie: God damn it!

Nora: Shit!

Ellie: Got you! Come on!

[They fight with their bare fists.]

WLF Soldier: Throw down your weapons!

Nora: No, no, wait. No, no, no, please--

[Ellie takes Nora hostage.]

Ellie: Back up!

WLF Soldier: Put your gun down!

Nora: You can walk away from this, okay. I can--

Ellie: Shut the fuck up!

WLF Soldier: Gun down, hands up!

Ellie: Get back!

WLF Soldier: You have nowhere to go.

Nora: No!

[Ellie jumps to the first floor with Nora. Both girls landed hard on their backs. The only thing… the whole lower floor is infected with spores.]

WLF Soldier: Get downstairs!

WLF Soldier: There, take her out!

[Nora begins to cough.]]

WLF Soldier: Masks on!

Ellie: Shit. (killing) Shh. Quiet. (killing) Don’t.

WLF Soldier: Over here!

[Ellie manages to escape the soldiers.]

Ellie: Okay. Where’d you go?

Ellie: Okay.

[She finds a coughing Nora nearby.]

Ellie: Hi, Nora.

Nora: Oh god... oh god.

[She has a metal pipe in her hands. Nora tries to fight Ellie, but her strength is running out. Ellie takes the pipe and hits Nora.]

Ellie: Where’s Abby?

Nora: You’re breathing spores. You’re her.

Ellie: You Firefly?

Nora: There are no Fireflies anymore.

Ellie: Where’s Abby?

Nora: I’m fucking dead anyway. Why would I tell you anything?

Ellie: Because I can make it quick. Or I can make it so much worse.

Nora: Think about what he did. How many people are dead because of him?

Ellie: It’s your last chance.

Nora: I’m not giving up my friend.

[Ellie covers the anger. She begins to beat Nora with an iron pipe over and over. Screen goes black sharply. In the next scene, Ellie is standing in front of the movie theater door. Her hands are covered with blood.]

Ellie: It’s me.

Dina: Ellie. Are you okay?

Jesse: Christ. Is that your blood?

Ellie: (unfolds her map) She’s hiding out in the... in this aquarium.

Dina: Okay. Come on. Let’s get you cleaned up.

[They go to the next room. Ellie still can’t recover from what she’s been through.  She does not know whether to cry to her or scream.]

Dina: Arms up.

[She helps Ellie take off her T-shirt. Her body is covered with bruises and scars. Dina takes a bucket of warm water and starts washing Ellie.]

Ellie: I made her talk.

Dina: Hey... It’s okay. (hugs her)

Ellie: I don’t want to lose you.

Dina: Good.

2 YEARS EARLIER
[Saint Mary’s Hospital. Night. Ellie wanders the dark corridors of the abandoned hospital.]

Ellie: What is this? Left a lot of stuff behind... Oh.

[She finds a recorder and taps the play button.]

Firefly: Most people have left already. I don’t know which group I’m going to join... I was one of the ones that wanted to go after the smuggler and the girl. They said… Even if we found her, or by some miracle found someone else that’s immune, it’d make no difference. ‘Cause the only person who could develop a vaccine is dead. (Ellie taps the rewind button) ...by some miracle found someone else that’s immune, it’d make no difference. (Ellie taps the rewind button again) ...miracle found someone else that’s immune, it’d make no difference. ‘Cause the only person

[Worried Joel gallops to her.]

Joel: Ellie! Come here. (hugs her) The hell were you thinkin’? Running off in the middle of the night like that. You talk to me. You don’t just leave me a goddamn note--

[She pushes Joel away.]

Ellie: Tell me... what happened here. If you lie to me one more time, I’m gone. You will never see me again. But if you tell me the truth. I’ll go back to Jackson. No matter what it is. Just say it, Joel.

[Joel lowers his head and pronounces in a quiet voice.]

Joel: Making a vaccine... would have killed you. So I stopped them.

[Ellie sits on an iron box barely holding back tears.]

Ellie: Oh my god. (cries) Don’t you fucking touch me! I’ll go back. But we’re done.

SEATTLE DAY 3
[Ellie wakes up in the movie theater. She gets dressed and goes to look for her friends.]

Ellie: Dina? Jesse? (reads a poster) "The war, the merrier." Hey look, Joel... It’s your favorite. Dina? Jesse?

[She finds Jesse. Dina sleeps on a couch. They go out on the balcony.]

Jesse: She had a rough night. Barely could get her to keep water down.

Ellie: You should’ve woken me up.

Jesse: Is she pregnant?

Ellie: Yeah.

Jesse: I get why you came out here, but we gotta take her back. She needs real care and she’s not gonna get that--

Ellie: Yeah, I know. I know. But I can’t just leave Tommy. He’s out here because of me. Maybe you could take her back.

Jesse: She’s not gonna leave without you,

Ellie: Yeah...

Jesse: Screw it. Let’s get Tommy. This aquarium that girl told you about. Tommy hasn’t found Abby yet. We’ll post up there until he does.

Ellie: And you’re good with leaving Dina by herself?

Jesse: Her orders.

Ellie: Okay. Let’s go tell her we’re leaving, then.

Jesse: I’ll just meet you out front.

Ellie: Yeah.

[She goes to wake up Dina.]

Dina: Hi.

Ellie: Hey, babe. I need you to lock the door for us.

Dina: Okay.

[Ellie goes out of the theater. It’s raining.]

Jesse: Let’s do it. Your map showed the aquarium along the shore. Should be down this way.

Ellie: Yeah. Ugh. How does anyone stay dry in this city?

Jesse: C’mon, help me up.

Ellie: Okay, go for it - Thanks.

Jesse: What’d you tell Dina?

Ellie: That we’re hoping to find Tommy at the aquarium. I didn’t... tell her you knew, if that’s what you’re--

Jesse: I wasn’t. This aquarium a Wolf base?

Ellie: I don’t think so. Nora said Abby’s hiding out there.

Jesse: You get her to tell you why they did it?

Ellie: Yeah. (clears her throat) Joel had a falling out with some Fireflies... Now former Fireflies.

Jesse: What kind of falling out?

Ellie: He was a smuggler. And they disagreed about some goods... Fight broke out. Some of them died. Guess they wanted payback.

Jesse: Damn... That change anything for you?

Ellie: Nope.

Jesse: I need to get clear on something. When we find Tommy, you’re good with going home?

Ellie: Yeah.

Jesse: You’ll be leaving some of those assholes alive.

Ellie: Dina should be back in Jackson.

Jesse: Okay. Good. You ever worry they’re going to come back to Jackson after us? How long has Dina been this sick?

[Ellie comes up to a shelf blocking the path.]

Ellie: Hey, gimme a hand?

[They push the shelf away.]

Jesse: Through here. I just gotta ask... Why didn’t she tell me about it? The pregnancy?

Ellie: Listen, I’m sure she’ll tell you about it when--

WLF Soldier: They say when we ship out?

Jesse: Shh!

WLF Soldier: It’s going down today! All the units are being rounded up.

WLF Soldier: Who did you hear it from?

WLF Soldier: Top man himself. We make sure this area’s clear, wait for the other units... and then take the fight to the Scars.

WLF Soldier: They say when we ship out?

WLF Soldier: It’s going down today! All the units are being rounded up.

WLF Soldier: But last time...

WLF Soldier: It won’t be like last time.

WLF Soldier: I’m nervous.

WLF Soldier: They have the whole coast covered.

Jesse: Down. Whoa. That’ll do it.

[They destroy a squad of WLF soldiers and move on.]

Jesse: These Wolves, man. So trigger-happy.

Ellie: They’re at war with this fucked up cult.

Jesse: Heard them talk about it. "Sera-phines" or something. "Seraphites?"

Ellie: "Scars" is all I’ve heard them called. You run into any?

Jesse: No.

Ellie: You’re lucky.

Jesse: What’s up with all these posters?

Ellie: It’s a bunch of comics. Wait. What was happening here?

Jesse: A gathering for people who were really into this stuff? Like you, basically.

Ellie: We were born in the wrong time, man.

Jesse: What were you saying? Before? About Dina. You said she’ll tell me when...

Ellie: Once things are wrapped up here.

Jesse: I guess at some point it’ll get pretty hard to hide it. Do you know if she’s gonna keep it?

Ellie: I don’t.

[They climb on the car and look around.]

Jesse: Look at this mess.

Ellie: (points at her map) The aquarium. It’s right next to that Ferris wheel.

Jesse: Here’s hoping Tommy has the same info. Damn it. Looks like we’re swimming. Okay, where now?

Ellie: Working on it. Psst. Infected.

Jesse: We got more!

Ellie: Okay, now that’s it.

Jesse: This place looks like a dead end.

Ellie: Yeah... I think you’re right.

Jesse: Go Team Jackson.

Ellie: Fuck these motherfuckers.

Jesse: Couldn’t have said it better.

Ellie: This way.

Jesse: Okay. After you. Think you can get through there?

Ellie: Let’s see.

Jesse: I would’ve come, you know. If you told me you were leaving.

Ellie: I just... I didn’t think you’d be okay with all of this.

Jesse: I looked up to Joel... What happened to him was messed up. I would’ve come.

Ellie: Joel liked you a lot too, you know. He used to think I had a crush on you.

Jesse: Really?

Ellie: I mean... you’re handsome and whatever... but I’m not into your type.

Jesse: What? Asians?

Ellie: Yeah... that’s obviously what I meant.

[Jesse and Ellie climb around the multi-storey bookstore.]

Jesse: (chuckles) Pretty messed up, putting fungus in the kid’s section.

Ellie: Mushrooms didn’t exactly carry the same meaning back then.

Jesse: Oh. Eh, I guess so. Did you have a favorite book as a kid?

Ellie: Yeah. Battle Ghosts. It’s about these space marines who fight off--

Jesse: Ghosts?

Ellie: Alien ghosts.

Jesse: Sounds... like something you’d like.

[I really hope that Ellie meant the Warhammer 40K series.]

Ellie: Okay... What about you, smartass?

Jesse: Well... my mom only had this one kid’s book. The Root Child. About this boy who turns into a forest to save his village.

Ellie: Okay....

Jesse: To keep things fresh, though... my mom would improvise different endings. This one time, the boy just let the whole village die. Whoa.

Ellie: This place is fucked.

Jesse: Blood’s still wet. Let’s get back to the street.

Ellie: Yeah.

Jesse: You hear that?

Ellie: Shit.

WLF Soldier: Bravo needs to get here. I’m ready to do this.

WLF Soldier: Storm’s pretty bad... I’m sure it ain’t easy driving the boat, back here.

WLF Soldier: I want to be the first one on that fucking beach...

WLF Soldier: You’ll get your chance. We all will.

Jesse: Dropped her.

WLF Soldier: Bear!!

Jesse: Got him. To your right! Think that was the last one.

Ellie: Yeah.

Jesse: This place makes me appreciate Jackson, man.

Ellie: Me too.

Jesse: I think Abby picked the aquarium on purpose cause it’s so damn hard to get to.

Ellie: Maybe.

[They leave the building and see that the road is flooded, and the nearest building is quite far away. Ellie sighs.]

Jesse: Jesus! How the hell are we crossin’ this?

Ellie: We could use that road. It’s pretty fucking far.

[Jesse notices a boat passing by.]

Jesse: Or we use that.

Ellie: Yeah. That’s better.

Jesse: Come on. This way.

Ellie: Let’s try through here.

Jesse: So what’s the plan? We take these guys out and steal their boat?

Ellie: We’re definitely taking their boat. It’s up to them if they want to get in our way.

Jesse: Hopefully it’s a small crew. Here.

Ellie: Got it. Come on.

Jesse: This way. C’mon.

[They sneak past the soldiers.]

WLF Soldier: Damn it!

WLF Soldier: Need a hand?

WLF Soldier: Nah, I got it. This engine’s being finicky.

WLF Soldier: Sniper spotted in 12. I repeat, sniper sighted at the marina. Likely a trespasser. Any nearby units report. Over.

WLF Soldier: Shit. You four, take the land bridge to the marina. The rest of you, we hold here and wait for orders.

WLF Soldier: What the fuck? We’re supposed to wait here while our guys are being sniped?

WLF Soldier: We have our orders. They’ll have more than enough people to take care of one sniper.

Jesse: Up above.

WLF Soldier: (trying to start the boat motor) Son of a bitch.

Jesse: (whispers) Ellie. We can get to the marina through here.

Ellie: No. We’re taking their boat.

Jesse: You heard them, right? They’re talking about Tommy.

Ellie: We don’t know that.

Jesse: Who else is it going to be?

Ellie: If it is him, he’ll be gone by the time we get there. Abby is where he’ll be headed, so if we just foll--

Jesse: What if he’s in trouble?

Ellie: He can take care of himself.

Jesse: Jesus Christ.

Ellie: The best way to help Tommy is to go after Abby. You do this, I’m not saving your ass again.

Jesse: (smiles) I really hope you make it.

[He leaves. Ellie jumps in the water and swims to the boat.]

WLF Soldier: Base, this is Unit Gamma. I just sent four soldiers to the marina.

WLF Soldier: Copy, Gamma. Will pass the info to command. Stand by for further instructions. Over.

WLF Soldier: Copy base.

WLF Soldier: You think this affects the raid tonight?

WLF Soldier: I don’t know.

WLF Soldier: Search the entire mall.

[Ellie gets into the boat and tries to get her started. Soldiers have already found out about her presence.]

Ellie: Please, please...

WLF Soldier: She’s taking the boat!

Ellie: Work! Yes!

[She leaves the marina.]

Ellie: Steady. Okay. No one’s following. Right. Where’s the Ferris wheel? Please go through. Now what? There you are... Okay, where’s this go? All right... Done. Here we go. Kidding me? Come on. Got it. Hmm. Damn it!

Seraphite: There’s another boat!

WLF Soldier: Incoming!

Ellie: Oh god! All right... Yeah, that looks right.

[She mooks the boat and goes to kill the guards.]

Ellie: (killing) Don’t. (killing) Shh. Shut up. (kiling) Shh. Quiet. (killing) Eat shit… Okay... Abby, where are you? Damn it. What is all this stuff? Where the fuck are you? Shit. (falls through the ventilation) Oh no! Ahh! Jesus. Fuck! Shit. Stupid dog. (finds an operation room) God. The fuck happened here? (hears some noise) Shit.

Woman: (muffled voices)

Owen: That engine’s fast enough, we can beat her there.

Mel: People don’t come back from that island!

Owen: How many times has Abby risked her life for you?

Mel: She chose this. I’m not fucking going there,

Owen: Then don’t! Go back.

Mel: Fuck you, Owen...

Ellie: Hands up. Where’s Abby?

Owen: You’re that girl from Jackson.

Ellie: Tell me where she went.

Mel: How do we know you won’t kill us?

Owen: You give her what she wants and we’re dead.

Ellie: You guys can survive this. I just need her.

Owen: Bullshit.

Ellie: You. Come here. Fucking get over here! Point to where she is on this map. And then you. It better fucking match up.

Mel: Okay--

Owen: What are you doing?

Mel: She’s probably dead anyway!

Owen: It is not worth it.

Ellie: Stop!

Owen: We can talk about--

Ellie: Back the fuck up! Point to where she is. Fucking point--!

[Owen attacks Ellie trying to take the gun, but Ellie shoots him in the stomach.]

Mel: Owen!

[She attacks Ellie with a knife. They fight for a while, but Ellie manages to take over. She stuck the knife in Mel’s neck.]

Ellie: Tell me where Abby is.

Owen: She’s...

Ellie: Where the fuck is she?

Owen: (inaudible)

[He dies.]

Ellie: No, no, no... Oh fuck... Oh fuck.

[Seeing the bodies of Mel and Owen Ellie falls to her knees. It rings in her ears, vomiting comes to her throat. Someone comes to her from behind. Ellie turns around and points her gun.]

Tommy: Ellie. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Неу...

Ellie: I’m sorry.

Tommy: It’s all right. Come on, let’s go. Let’s go. It’s all right.

[They leave with Jesse.  Only the blood of those who were killed slowly flows on the floor. In the next scene, we see Dina. She is asleep and is having some kind of bad dream. Next to her lies Ellie and fixes her hair. She dresses up and goes to the next room.]

Tommy: Hmm. Hey! Come check this out.

Jesse: What, you got a plan?

Tommy: I was thinking we cut through the lowlands, here.

Jesse: That’s not gonna work. It’s completely covered in snow.

Tommy: No, by the time we get there, this whole area’ll be thawed. (to Ellie) Where you going?

Ellie: Needed some air. What are you guys doing up?

Tommy: Couldn’t sleep.

Jesse: Come take a look at this. Thought is to head home via Ellensburg.

Tommy: If we’re in Fall City by tomorrow, we’re doing good. Hey. They got what they deserved.

Ellie: But she gets to live.

Tommy: Yeah. Is that okay?

Ellie: It has to be.

Tommy: I’m really not looking forward to going through Idaho again.

Jesse: What you should be worried about is what Maria’s gonna do to you when we get home.

Tommy: We’ve been through worse. However, I was passing through some ritzy section of town, came across this necklace. It sparkles a lot. I think it’s real gold.

Jesse: You think it’s real gold.

Tommy: It’s real gold.

Jesse: Let’s see it.

Tommy: I know what gold looks like.

Jesse: If it’s legit, can we say it’s from all of us?

Tommy: Ha! You find your own damn bribes.

Jesse: How you doing?

Ellie: Fine.

Jesse: Ellie.

Ellie: Fine. Thanks for coming back for me.

Jesse: My friends’ problems are my problems,

Ellie: You’re such a sap.

Jesse: All right. How about, my friends can’t get out of their own damn way?

Ellie: That’s better.

[They hear some noise in the next room.]

Ellie: Shit!

[Ellie and Jesse run out to get their weapons. Before the door opens, Jesse gets shot in the face and instantly dies.]

Ellie: Jesse?

[Tommy lies on the floor. Over him stands… Abby. She is furious.]

Abby: Stand up! Hands in the air or I shoot this one, too!

Tommy: Don’t you do it, Ellie! Get out of here!

Abby: Stand up now!

Tommy: Don’t you fucking dare--

Abby: (kicks him) Shut the fuck up!

Ellie: Fuck.

Abby: All right--

Ellie: Stop, stop!

Abby: Toss your weapon. Toss your weapon!

Ellie: Fuck!

Tommy: No... no...

Ellie: I know why you killed Joel. He did what he did to save me. There’s no cure because of me. I’m the one that you want. Just let him go.

Abby: You killed my friends... We let you both live and you wasted it!

[She points her gun at Ellie. We are abruptly thrown back in time.]

4 YEARS EARLIER
[Young Abby is running through the woods.]

Abby: Dad? Dad! C’mon. Dad? Dad, come on! You can’t keep doing this! Dad! Where are you?

Abby: Whoa! Jeez. That worked. (finds a coin) Look at that... 1978. Can’t get through here. Maybe I can get onto the roof. (moves a container) There. Okay... Smooth, Abby. (falls from the roof) Oh no--! Ugh.

Jerry: Abs? You, uh, you got a little mud on you there, sweetheart.

Abby: So do you.

Jerry: Where?

Abby: (throws some mud at him) Right there. You know, every time you run off like this, they give me shit about it.

Jerry: Come on.

Abby: Believe it or not, they actually care about your safety

Jerry: These woods are safe.

Abby: Dad.

Jerry: Abs. She’s been hanging out right on the other side of those trees.

Abby: And?

Jerry: She’s due any day now. We’ll just check on her and then we’ll head back. I promise.

Abby: Let’s just make it quick.

Jerry: See? I’ve got my little girl to keep me safe. How’d you know I was here? Owen ratted me out, didn’t he?

Abby: He did his job.

Jerry: How’d you get him to talk?

Abby: Uhh… I asked. Hey! Look what I found.

Jerry: Oh, wow! 1978. Don’t have that one in my collection.

Abby: You can keep it. If you promise not to pull anything like this again.

Jerry: (laughs) You got yourself a deal.

Abby: Why don’t I believe you?

Jerry: No reason I can think of. Come on! Let’s keep looking.

Abby: Dad!

Jerry: Relax... You’ll be back with Owen before you know it.

Abby: Wait, what?

Jerry: Nothing! Just... Noticed you two have been hanging out a lot. More so than usual.

Abby: Oh god. How long have you known?

Jerry: I’m your dad. I see things. Like the way you both try really, really hard not to look at each other when you’re around me.

Abby: I can’t handle this.

Jerry: And he makes you laugh.

Abby: That’s ‘cause he’s such an idiot.

Jerry: I just like how he’s extra nice to me now. Abs, look! Fresh tracks!

Abby: Wait. This is just your sneaky way of giving me a tracking lesson, isn’t it?

Jerry: I would never. Is it working?

Abby: Well, I mean, I found you.

Jerry: Yeah, but you cheated.

Abby: "You do what you need to do to get it done."

Jerry: Wow... You actually listen.

Abby: You have your moments of wisdom.

Jerry: Let’s see if we can find anything else.

[Abby finds a dead baby of some ungulate animal.]

Abby: Uh, Dad? I found... something.

Jerry: Oh my god. She already gave birth.

Abby: Eww.

Jerry: And look - two sets of tracks.

Jerry: And look - two sets of tracks.

Abby: Dad?

Jerry: It’s her. Let’s go!

Abby: That doesn’t sound good.

Jerry: No. She’s in pain. Abs? Come on.

Abby: Dad, wait. What if there are infected around?

Jerry: This area’s clear.

Abby: You know they roam?

Jerry: You brought your gun, right?

Abby: Course.

Jerry: Then I’m not worried. Oh shit. Abs!

Abby: What? Oh my god.

[They see a trapped zebra.]

Jerry: We’ve got to cut her loose. (to zebra) It’s okay, calm down. Don’t worry, we’re not going to hurt ya. It’s okay. Damn it, it’s really in there. All right, uh, Abs, come here. Here. I’m gonna hold her.

Abby: Okay.

Jerry: All right. Calm down! Calm down, calm down.

Owen: Doc! Doc, are you around here?

Jerry: Over here, Owen!

Owen: What...

Jerry: Hey, get over here and help me hold her!

Owen: We need you back up at the--

Jerry: Owen! Hold her. C’mon!

Owen: Here, look out.

Jerry: Shh, shh, shh! You got her tight?

Owen: Uhh... yeah.

Jerry: All right, get in there. Abs. Steady, steady.

Owen: Shit!

Abby: Almost... Okay... Done!

[The zebra runs away.]

Owen: Holy fuck. Everybody’s looking for you, we gotta-- (Jerry runs after the zebra) Hey, wait!

Abby: Dad! What’s going on?

Owen: C’mon!

Jerry: We did good back there.

Owen: Doc, that girl showed up.

Jerry: What girl?

Owen: The one Marlene keeps talking about. They found her in the tunnels. She has an old bite mark on her arm. No signs of infection.

Jerry: That can’t be.

Owen: They’re already running tests on her, but... you gotta get down there.

Abby: Dad?

Owen: Come on.

[New stage. Marlene and Jerry talking in the doctor’s office.]

Jerry: It’s intertwined with the brain, there’s no other option.

Marlene: There has to be some other way.

Jerry: There’s no way to remove the specimen without destroying the host.

Marlene: The host? She is a child, not some petri dish.

Jerry: You think I don’t-- I’m aware of the situation

Marlene: And you’re okay with killing her?

Jerry: No, I’m okay with developing a vaccine that’ll help save millions of lives. How many Fireflies have died for less?

Marlene: That was their choice. Are you asking me, or are you telling me this is how it’s gonna be?

Jerry: I am begging you to buy in.

Marlene: And what if this was Abby?

Jerry: Look, everything that we’ve been fighting for, all the sacrifices, all the horrific… all of that is justified with this one act.

Marlene: If this was your daughter, what would you do?

Jerry: (notices his daughter at the door) Abby.

Abby: I brought you some dinner.

Jerry: Thank you, sweetheart. Look, Marlene--

Marlene: Do it.

Jerry: Thank you.

Marlene: I’m gonna go tell Joel.

Jerry: Why?

Marlene: He traveled across the country with her. He has a right to know. Good luck with your surgery.

[Marlene leaves the room. Jerry sits on his table and exhales from tension.]

Abby: You’re doing the right thing.

Jerry: Yeah.

Abby: If it was me... I’d want you to do the surgery.

[Next scene. Abby enters the hospital with a gun in her hands. The siren is howling. She entered the operation room.]

Owen: Is he still in the fucking building? Abby. Abby, don’t look --

Abby: (screams) Dad! Dad! No! (cries) No! No...

[Next scene. The execution of Joel.]

Ellie: (lying on the floor) Joel, get up. Joel, fucking get up! Please stop! Please don’t do this… Joel, please get up!

[Abby cracks Joel’s skull open.]

Ellie: Nooo!

Man: (spits on Joel’s corpse) Burn in hell, pendejo.

Ellie: I’ll fucking kill you.

[The man pulls out a gun and walks to Ellie.]

Owen: Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? Manny.

Manny: Cleaning up.

Owen: No, no, no, we’re here for him. That’s it.

Manny: It’s too risky to leave them alive.

Owen: Too fucking bad.

Mel: He’s right. We can’t have loose ends.

Owen: We kill them, we’re no better than he was. They didn’t do anything wrong!

Jordan: Yeah? Look at my face--

Owen: Fuck your face. You should’ve been guarding the upstairs like I told you to.

Jordan: Move.

Owen: Back up.

Mel: Calm down.

Jordan: Or what?

Owen: Back the fuck up!

Mel: Calm down!

Manny: Jordan!

Owen: You gonna shoot me?

Abby: Stop! We’re done.

SEATTLE DAY 1
[Abby wakes up from a long dream. She’s reading “City of Thieves” by David Benioff and falls asleep. Can’t blame her.]

Manny: Abby. Yo. Easy. You okay, Abs?

Abby: Yeah, just... What’s up?

Manny: Been searching everywhere for you. We’re being called up. Isaac wants us at the front.

Abby: What? Are you serious?

Manny: Afraid so. We should hustle.

Abby: We’re leaving now?

Manny: Yes. Vámonos.

Abby: Okay. Fuck, my neck.

Manny: Hey, thanks for giving me the room last night.

Abby: Yeah. Who was it this time? That cook chick?

Manny: Nah, the weather chick. She’s down from the mountain.

Abby: Oh, the scientist. Nice.

Manny: Ehh. She’s a little too excited about her job... Talked my ear off about some storm and... I dunno.

Abby: Worth it, though?

Manny: Oh... absolutely. I can die happy now.

Abby: You should. You’re never gonna do better than her.

Manny: I keep thinking the same thing... Hello, Miss Potts.

Woman: Hello, Manny.

Abby: Her too?

Manny: A gentleman never tells. I gotta talk to my dad for a second. Grab us some food?

Abby: Yeah. On it.

Manny: Get me something con picante.

Abby: You get what you get.

Jordan: Nice to see you too, Abby.

Abby: Oh shit, Jordan. I didn’t see you there,

Jordan: You coming with us to the Serevena?

Abby: Manny and I just got called up to the FOB. What are you doing at the Serevena?

Jordan: Hotel and the school are getting evacuated. We’re grabbing supplies and bringing everyone back to the base,

Abby: Seriously?

Jordan: Yeah, can you fucking believe after everything, we’re falling back?

Abby: You don’t know that’s what it is

Jordan: At least Leah might be home from the TV station sooner.

Abby: There’s that, yeah. I should run. May your survival be long.

Jordan: And may your death be swift.

Abby: Hey, sir.

Mr. Alvarez: Ah... Abby!

Abby: How are you feeling?

Mr. Alvarez: Fantastic. Would you please tell him to get rid of this? (touches Manny’s beard)

Abby: Ugh, I’ve tried.

Manny: I look good.

Mr. Alvarez: Te ves horrible. (You look awful.)

Manny: Bueno. We have to head out.

Mr. Alvarez: Keep him safe!

Abby: For you, I will. What are they serving today?

WLF Soldier: Burritos. Again.

Abby: Kay...

Manny: Abby, what are you doing? (to the cook) Ey, tenemos prisa. Dame tres burritos. (Hey, we’re in a hurry. Give me three burritos.)

WLF Soldier: Hey man, there’s a line!

WLF Soldier: Manny, what the fuck?

Abby: Excuse me.

WLF Soldier: Wait your turn like the rest of us!

Abby: Sorry.

Manny: We’re going to the front. Come on.

Abby: Ugh, so embarrassing. Why do you have three? Put one back.

Manny: Now don’t freak out. Mel’s coming with us.

Abby: Manny--!

Manny: Where’s your pack? In the room?

Abby: Why are you doing this to me?

Manny: Because I care about both of you... And I’m tired of all the bullshit.

Abby: Does she know I’m on this drive?

Manny: She does.

Abby: And she’s cool with it?

Manny: Yeah...

Abby: Why does your yeah sound like a no?

Manny: It’s my accent. C’mon. Stop being paranoid.

[Abby starts chewing burritos and talking simultaneously.]

Abby: I think you get a kick out of making me uncomfortable.

Manny: No... It’s an opportunity for you two to finally move forward.

Abby: We’ve barely said a word to each other since Jackson. I’m just supposed to pretend that didn’t happen?

Manny: Of course not. You guys need to talk about it.

Abby: She wanted Joel dead as much as the rest of us.

Manny: But she’s not like the rest of us. She hasn’t hurt people like that before.

Abby: She kills Scars all the time.

Manny: Not the way we killed Joel. Don’t forget, we’re grunts... She’s a medic. C’mon, Abby... She’s family. Do it for me, okay?

Abby: I’ll try.

Manny: That’s all I’m asking for. Get your things ready. I’m gonna grab Mel.

Abby: Yeah.

Abby: Bite me.

[Abby enters the room.]

Abby: (finds a bra) Scientist, huh?

Manny: Knock knock. Ready to roll?

[Manny and Mel enter the room. Mel’s big belly is clearly visible. She has either become very fat or pregnant.]

Abby: Yeah, just about. (to Mel) Hi.

Mel: Hey.

Abby: They actually cleared you for active duty.

Mel: Barely.

Abby: You can probably get a stay if you ask.

Mel: I’d rather not sit around if I don’t have to.

Abby: And Owen’s okay with this?

Mel: Why would it be up to Owen? We need to grab Alice on our way.

Manny: Hey. Do better.

[Abby pushes him with her strong, pumped-up arm. They leave the room and set off on their way.]

Manny: What are you getting called up for?

Mel: It’s just a usual rotation, don’t worry.

Manny: Hey, when you get back, will you check on my dad? He seems... I dunno. Worse.

Mel: Worse how?

Manny: Well, he’s complaining about a sharp pain in his wrists. He can barely hold a spoon.

Mel: Maybe we can get him some more painkillers.

Abby: Heard they moved you and Owen to section ninety-six?

Mel: Yeah. It’s nice. It’s lots of young families.

Abby: Getting you guys excited? About the baby?

Mel: Seeing all the kids running around... Yeah, um... I’m getting ready.

Manny: All those crying babies... Must drive Owen crazy.

Mel: He hasn’t even seen it yet. He’s out on rotation with Danny.

Abby: Danny? Yikes. Sucks for him.
Mel: Yeah.

[They approach the checkpoint, secured by an iron mesh fence.]

Mel: Signing out Alice.

WLF Soldier: She’s playing inside.

Mel: Great. Abby, you wanna grab her?

Abby: (walks to a dog) Hey, girl. Hey, you crazy dog.

Manny: There’s my favorite girl.

Abby: Only one that will put up with your shit.

Manny: Don’t be jealous.

Abby: Oh, hey there, Bear. Yeah, okay, since you asked so nicely. Who’s the best boy? (scratch behind dog’s ear) Yeah. Get the ball.

Mel: Did I see you with Jenn last night?

Manny: Yes, you did.

Mel: You dirty dog. What’s she doing in town?

Manny: Something for Isaac.

Mel: Man, that’s gotta be a lonely job.

Manny: She really likes it. Ask her about cumulus clouds.

Mel: (laughs) I guess you get to stay away from the combat.

Manny: Yeah, if that’s what you’re into.

Mel: I’d be happy staying put, I think.

Woman: Hey, Abby.

Abby: Heyya.

Mel: Just treating families.

Manny: You’d miss fucking up Scars.

Mel: I don’t think so.

Manny: I’d go crazy...

Mel: Hey Pat.

WLF Soldier: Hey.

Abby: Hey, Pat. Can I have my usual?

WLF Soldier: You got it.

[Abby and Manny take the weapons from the armory.]

Manny: Gracias.

Abby: Which trucks are in?

WLF Soldier: Take S24.

Manny: I’m driving. Sign us out.

Abby: Pendejo. Thanks.

WLF Soldier: May your survival be long.

Abby: May your death be swift.

Manny: I could use a warm up.

Mel: (to her dog) Yeah... yeah... who’s a good girl? I missed you too.

Manny: Down for some friendly competition?

Abby: Loser cleans the apartment.

Manny: Mm, high stakes. Best score on a full magazine?

Abby: You’re on, cabrón.

[She wins.]

Abby: Ha!

Manny: I’m requesting that gun next time.

Abby: Yeah. The gun’s why I won. Oh, that reminds me, there is a huge pile of dirty dishes.

Manny: You’re cruel.

Abby: Ooh, you can fold my laundry too.

Abby: Let’s get to the base.

Man: More ammo if you two need it.

Manny: Alice gets shotgun!

Abby: Mel’s pregnant!

Manny: She could use the fresh air. Give you two a chance to talk.

Mel: Real subtle, Manny.

Manny: ¡Gracias!

[Abby, Manny and Mel leave the base on the truck.]

Mel: How’ve you been sleeping these days?

Abby: Not great.

Mel: Do you want me to get you something from the pharmacy?

Abby: Nah, I’m good.

Mel: It’s not a big deal...

Abby: No, it’s fine. I’m just gonna wear myself out. I’m just gonna wear myself out. I’ve been picking up a few extra assignments.

Mel: You and Owen.

Abby: What do you mean?

Mel: Nothing.

WLF Soldier: Hey. Manny. Where you headed?

Manny: Two.

WLF Soldier: Truck S24 headed to Two! May your survival be long.

Manny: And your death be swift.

Mel: Heard we lost a hatchery.

Abby: Yeah.

Mel: Any plan on getting it back?

Abby: Nah, Isaac says it’s low priority. We’re fishing enough wild salmon right now. What did you mean about me and Owen?

Mel: Um... I haven’t seen him in like two weeks. He keeps picking up open assignments. Has he talked to you, did he say anything?

Abby: No, we’re still not-- I mean, I’ve seen him in the mess hall but... we walk around each other. Jackson shook him, you know. I wouldn’t read too much into it. Ah, shit!

[The truck will be followed by several men on horseback.]

Mel: Ambush!

Manny: Hang on!

Abby: Mel, stay low. They were waiting for us.

Mel: Yeah!

Manny: Take them out!

Abby: The fuck you think we’re doing? Manny, get us out of this!

Manny: I’m trying!

Abby: They just keep coming!

Seraphite: You’re not leaving this place!

[Fanatics set the hood of the truck on fire.]

Manny: I can’t see!

Mel: Fuck!

Abby: Manny!

Manny: Hang on!

[They fall from the cliff to the building below.]

Abby: Shit!

Manny: ¡Ahh, la verga! (Ahh, fuck!)

Abby: You okay?

Mel: Yeah! Yeah.

Manny: Fuckin’ Scars.

Abby: How far are we from the FOB?

Mel: It’s a hike.

Seraphite: (whistles)

Manny: We’re too exposed. Let’s get inside. It’s clear, c’mon!

[They go to a large warehouse. Manny closes the door.]

Manny: Hey Abs. There’s enough stuff here to make a pipe bomb.

Abby: Copy that. Lots of places to hide in here.

Mel: Guys. Got company. Infected.

[Abby kills the dead.]

Abby: We clear?

Mel: Yeah. Clear.

Manny: This is so much better than getting drunk and watching anime.

Abby: What?

Manny: Nothing.

Abby: Guys, look up there. See the light coming through?

Manny: Could be a way out.

Abby: I’ll climb up there and check it out. Here we go.

[She jumps on the shelves. One of them can’t stand our muscular heroine and it collapses.]

Manny: Abby!

Mel: Abby!

Manny: Hang on!

[Abby finds herself buried under the pieces of the shelf.]

Abby: Guys!

Mel: Here they come!

Mel: Here they come!

Manny: Come on! Shit, watch out! Gotcha.

Mel: On our right! Runner!

Manny: Keep at it! Get off her!

Mel: Watch that shambler! Shit.

Abby: Shit. That it?

Manny: Yeah.

Abby: Can we say fuck this place?

Manny: Yes.

Mel: Fuck this place.

Abby: C’mon. Manny.

[They open the door to the greenhouse.]

Manny: You got it. Ladies first.

Mel: Another month and I wouldn’t fit through here.

Manny: Go ahead, Abs.

Abby: You said ladies first.

Manny: I like you, Abs. Okay.

Mel: Abby. This reminds me of your dad’s greenhouse.

Abby: Shouldn’t. All these plants are alive,

Mel: Good point.

Manny: You know what? This is good... You two needed a bonding moment.

Mel: Shut up. Manny.

Abby: Shut up, Manny.

Manny: Working already.

Abby: FOB’s dead ahead.

Manny: No Scars in sight.

Abby: They’re out there.

Mel: Yeah. Let’s keep moving. God. Remember when we could pass through this area without getting jumped by Scars?

Abby: Getting nostalgic about the truce? Easier days, huh?

Manny: Too easy. We let our guard down. And they strung up an entire squad.

Mel: That was in retaliation to us shooting those kids.

Manny: Okay, but... Those "kids" attacked our guys... What would you do?

Mel: I don’t know, not riddle them with bullets?

Manny: I’d rather save our people.

Mel: Manny, they’re kids... it’s not their fault.

Abby: Not our fault either. Those deaths are on them.

Mel: Okay.

Manny: Not to jinx us... But it is very quiet out here.

Abby: Keep checking those sightlines. Shit. Something’s blocking the door.

Mel: Maybe there’s another way in.

Abby: Manny, see what’s up there.

Manny: On it. (climbs the cable) The cable’s caught on something. There you go! Come on up!

Abby: Mel, stay with Alice. I’ll try to get that door open. Find you two another way in.

Mel: Cool! Be careful!

[Abby climbs on the roof.]

Abby: Well?

Manny: Still no sign of Scars...

Abby: Whoa.

Manny: Long way down.

Abby: Yeah, yeah it is. There we go. (jumps into the building) Okay, Mel. We’re in!

Mel: I’m at the door.

[Abby picks up a large metal cabinet that was blocking the door.]

Abby: Okay, come on, quick!

Mel: Go on, girl. Thanks.

Abby: Yeah, sure.

[Mel and Manny enter the building.]

Manny: Through here. Whoa. Check it out. Some kind of boat workshop.

Mel: Let’s remember this place. Command’s always on the lookout for spare parts.

Manny: You know... My dad took me fishing on a boat like this. I got seasick every time. I hated it.

Mel: Manny, don’t ever get pregnant.

Manny: Doing my best.

[Abby lifts up the iron gate with the strength of her huge muscles.]

Abby: Okay. I’ll hold it here, go!

Manny: I’ll brace it with something.

Abby: Fuck!

[The handle of the mechanical lift does not hold and breaks. Manny has time to move to the other side of the gate, but pregnant Mel does not.]

Mel: Ahh!

Abby: Shit, sorry.

Manny: You two okay?

Abby: Yeah. Crank broke.

Manny: What now?

Mel: Abby, look.

Abby: A hatch. Manny just hang tight, we’re gonna find a way up to the roof.

Manny: Okay.

Abby: So. Glad you hitched a ride with us?

Mel: Right... Remind me to thank Manny for that one. I am glad I’m here with you guys. I’d hate to hear you got in trouble and I couldn’t help.

Abby: Hey... Why have you been avoiding me?

Mel: I wasn’t avoiding you.

Abby: C’mon. You’ve barely said anything to me since Jackson

Mel: I don’t know... I guess I was... Shook by Jackson, too.

Abby: You don’t think Joel deserved what he got?

Mel: I think he deserved worse, I just... I just wish I didn’t take part in it.

Abby: I get it. What kind of person can do that, right?

Mel: I’m not saying that.

Abby: Let’s see if there’s a way to the hatch.

Mel: All right... Hey Abby. Boost me up there. I’ve got an idea.

Abby: I like ideas. Okay. Here we... go!

Mel: Got it!

Abby: So what’s your idea?

Mel: Um... One sec.

Abby: What’re you doing?

Mel: Getting us out of here.

Abby: Okay, just... go slow.

Mel: One advantage of being pregnant... low center of gravity.

Abby: I’ll take your word for it.

Mel: Made it! Come on up.

Abby: Thank you!

[Abby climbs to Mel.]

Mel: Okay... getting closer to the hatch.

Abby: Let’s see...

[She uses a ladder to make a bridge.]

Mel: Hey. Smart. What do you see?

Abby: No way out from here. (finds a coin) I don’t have this one. (finds “David versus Goliath” book about guerrilla warfare) Been wanting to read something like this...

Mel: Reminds me a little of Owen’s boat.

Abby: Is he still trying to fix that thing up?

Mel: Yeah. But he says he’ll be done "any day now."

Abby: “Any day now." Everybody’s got their obsession.

Mel: Like me and dog toys.

Abby: Yup. And me with my stupid coins.

Mel: (chuckle)

Abby: What should we do?

Mel: We can use the ladder to get over there... Okay! That’s promising... Oh. Nice.

Abby: Whoa - long way down.

Mel: Vertigo hitting you hard?

Abby: Especially when I look down.

[She gets on the roof.]

Abby: There they are. Manny! Be right down.

Manny: Okay!

Mel: Look! FOB sweet FOB. Almost there.

Abby: Bet we can cut through that railyard.

Mel: You want to get off the roof first?

Abby: Please.

Mel: It’s kind of hard to imagine you being afraid of anything.

Abby: I’m not as fearless as you think.

Mel: Oh please.

Abby: Like I could never do the surgery stuff you do. I’d be too freaked out about fucking it up.

Mel: You think I don’t feel the same way?

Abby: Well, for what it’s worth my dad always said you were his best student.

Mel: He did? Well... you always said he was an idiot. C’mon.

[They jump to the ground.]

Mel: Alice! Ooh, good girl...

Manny: About time you two caught up.

Abby: Been quiet out here?

Manny: Yeah. I don’t like it.

Abby: Well... we’re almost to the FOB.

Manny: Man... When we get back home... I’m gonna find a couch... Watch a movie… ...And drink until I pass out.

Abby: (finds a letter) Okay, interesting.

Manny: Anything good?

Abby: Might be a gun cache around here.

Manny: I like the sound of that.

Abby: It actually worked. Here we go... I like all of this...

Abby: Guys: Down this way. Okay, we’ll follow the tracks. That’ll get us back on the main road to the FOB.

Manny: I don’t like this.

Abby: I know. Keep your eyes open.

Mel: Any way over that wall?

Manny: Not that I can see.

[They hear someone’s voice from afar.]

Seraphite: Those Wolves should’ve been here by now.

Abby: Shh. Quiet.

Seraphite: Maybe they were taken by demons.

Abby: Here comes more of ‘em.

Seraphite: Hm. Better they fall to us, but... I guess it doesn’t matter.

Seraphite: Each fallen Wolf brings us closer to a better world. Now... keep eyes.

Abby: (grabs the fanatic and puts a gun to his head) Don’t try anything.

[Other fanatics notice the heroes. Abby breaks the fanatic’s neck and a gunfight begins.]

Abby: Move up!

Manny: Stay down. Heads up! Got you! Got him.

Abby: Holy shit. That it?

Manny: I don’t see any more.

Abby: On me. Let’s go.

[The firefight ends and the heroes go on.]

Abby: Guys. Up here.

Mel: C’mon, girl. Look. We’re almost there.

Abby: Through here. Damn it...

Seraphite: Surround them!

Mel: There’s too many of them!

Manny: Fall back! Get inside!

Mel: I’m running out of ammo!

Manny: You won’t get me, you psychos!

[Suddenly, reinforcements are approaching. But not for the fanatics!]

Mel: It’s our guys!

WLF Soldier: Surprise, motherfuckers!

Manny: Woo! There we go! Light ‘em up, guys!

WLF Soldier: Cease fire! All clear! All clear!

WLF Soldier: C’mon! Let’s go before more of those freaks show up!

Manny: I love you guys! I’m gonna name all my children after you!

WLF Soldier: Ready?

Abby: Glad you guys were around.

WLF Soldier: Lucky we drove by. Heard all the shooting.

[Abby climbs into the truck, in which a man with his palm shot is already sitting.]

WLF Soldier: Shit!

Abby: Fuck, man, you okay?

WLF Soldier: I think I’ll survive this.

Abby: Here, got you.

Mel: Hey, lemme see your hand.

Manny: We’re in!

[The truck drives away.]

Mel: I know, we’re almost there.

[They drive to the base.]

WLF Soldier: Open the gates! Let ‘em through.

Abby: Mel.

Mel: What?

Abby: Your back.

[She got wounded. The blood stain on her jacket was covered with her backpack.]

Mel: Squeeze this as hard as you can, okay?

Manny: Holy shit.

Mel: I didn’t even feel it.

Abby: (to the guards) Hey! We got two.

Mel: Hey, he’s got a gunshot wound to the hand.

Abby: (to Mel) Hey. You did all right back there.

Mel: That was almost a compliment.

Manny: Go get help.

Mel: Stay, Alice.

WLF Soldier: Come on, it’s this way.

Manny: Sit. That was a lot of blood, right?

Abby: She shouldn’t be out.

Manny: She’ll be okay. She’ll be okay.

WLF Soldier: Hey, who’ve we got here?

Manny: Hey, c’mon, girl. This is Alice.

WLF Soldier: Come on, Alice. Good girl.

Manny: Thank you! (to Abby) These new recruits. I don’t trust ‘em. (outloud) Thanks again guys!

Man: Hey, Manny, hold up! You’re top dogs, you know what’s going on?

Manny: What do you mean?

Man: We’ve been stationed here for three days with nothing coming down the pipe.

Manny: Then you should be thanking us for getting some action

Man: C’mon, you owe us one. Can you find out what’s up?

Abby: Checkin’ in.

WLF Soldier: Hey, you two.

Manny: What you got for us?

WLF Soldier: No assignment. It just says report to Isaac.

Abby: Both of us?

WLF Soldier: Yeah.

Manny: Never been this busy here.

Abby: Something’s going down.

Manny: We better find Isaac.

Abby: We should make sure Mel’s okay first.

Man: Hey, Abby. That’s some nice work you put in there,

Abby: Thanks. Um, you seen Isaac anywhere?

Man: Nah. With all this commotion, I’d be hiding too.

Abby: Hey, man.

Man: Abby! Heard someone had to save your ass for once.

Abby: Yeah I mean, one time.

Woman: Hey there, Abby.

Abby: Heyya.

Woman: Abby! C’mere a sec.

Abby: Yeah?

Woman: Heard about your ambush. Where’d they hit you?

Abby: (points on the map) Uh, right around here. Near the warehouses.

Woman: Shit. They keep slipping past our lines.

Abby: Hey, you know where Isaac is?

Woman: He was here a few minutes ago.

Abby: Okay, thanks. We’ll look around.

WLF Soldier: Looks pretty bad, huh Doc?

Woman: I’ve seen worse. Hold still.

WLF Soldier: Yeah.

Abby: Hey, man. Feelin’ better?

WLF Soldier: Uh, pain meds are kickin’ in, so, yeah.

Abby: Hang in there.

WLF Soldier: Gonna keep most of my fingers.

Manny: Heh, brother, you only need three.

Mel: I know. It all happened so fast. It could’ve been much worse, though.

Nora: Hmm. Speak of the devil.

Mel: Hey, guys.

Manny: How you doin’, Melon?

Mel: Just a few more... stitches, and I’ll be good as new.

Nora: You guys need to convince this girl to relax.

Abby: Hey, Mel. Relax.

Mel: You got it.

Nora: Hey, um, I need some muscle, so can you two give me a hand with something?

Abby: Sure.

Manny: Don’t move.

Mel: I’ll just be here. Relaxing.

Manny: Nora. Have you had a chance to relax?

Nora: I’m shipping out to the west side hospital in a few. Orders are to get everything.

Abby: How’s Mel? Really?

Nora: The baby’s vitals were a little elevated, but... I’m not worried.

Abby: Someone should get word to Owen. He’ll want to be here for her.

Nora: Yeah. I need to show you guys something.

Manny: What is it?

Nora: Follow me.

[She brings her... to the morgue.]

Abby: Oh my god. Are these all ours?

Nora: Yeah. And more coming in by the hour. You can’t tell Mel, all right?

Manny: Nora...

Nora: Just... not yet. Come here.

Abby: Who’s in that body bag?

Manny: Holy shit, it’s Danny.

Abby: Where’s Owen?

Nora: I don’t know. A few days back, there were some Scar sightings out by the marina. Danny and Owen were sent on a sweep. And this morning, the guards found Danny collapsed by the perimeter fence. He’d walked himself back with a bullet in his stomach.

Manny: ¡Pinches Scars! ¡Hijos de puta!

Nora: Isaac talked with him until he passed but.... as far as I can tell, there’s no units going back that way.

Abby: So what about Owen? Did you ask Isaac what happened?

Nora: Yeah, I tried! But he gave me that... that fucking look and then he told me to keep quiet about it. Which means you can’t say shit.

Manny: Owen’s a big boy. I’m sure he’s fine.

Abby: Where is Isaac? I’ll be discreet.

Nora: Last I heard he was in the apartments. Okay, I’m gonna go check up on Mel, so.... let me know what you guys find out.

Abby: Yeah.

Manny: Man...

Abby: Why the hell hasn’t Isaac sent out a search party for Owen?

Manny: Maybe he has and just didn’t tell Nora.

Abby: I fucking hope so. We’re looking for Isaac.

Man: He’s inside. Go on in.

Manny: Thank you.

Man: Damn, look who it is!

Manny: ‘Sup, fellas.

Man: Got time for a game?

Manny: Ehh, can’t. Here for Isaac.

Woman: Whatever, bigshot.

Manny: Not my fault I’m so good at what I do.

Woman: Mm-hmm.

Manny: See you around.

[They walk past prison cells.]

Manny: I don’t miss this place. Fuck... Always hated the smell.

Abby: After our morning... I wouldn’t mind a few minutes with these guys.

Manny: I hear that.

[Abby and Manny walk to the guard near a torture room there Isaac is.]

WLF Soldier: Hey. Abby.

Abby: We need to go up.

WLF Soldier: Isaac’s in there.

Abby: Oh. Do you know if he’ll be long?

WLF Soldier: He said to get him when you two arrive. C’mon. (knocks on the door)  Sir. Abby and Manny are here.

[Isaac tortures some poor man exhausted by hunger and beatings.]

Isaac: (gives his knife to the guard) Don’t let him fall asleep.

WLF Soldier: Yes, sir.

Isaac: (to Abby and Manny) Let’s go up. I heard you two ran into some trouble?

Manny: No losses on our side, just some minor injuries. Can’t say the same for them.

Isaac: Wish I was hearing more of that.

Manny: Never seen the base this packed.

Isaac: Give it another day. Still waiting on some units.

Manny: What’s going on, boss?

Isaac: These small skirmishes... We can’t keep going like this.

Manny: Then, what?

Isaac: We could try another truce, but how long before some asshole on their side or our side unravels the whole thing? No. It has to be all of them.

Manny: Sir, we’ve tried attacking their island and--

Isaac: Not like this. Not with everyone. There’s a big storm a few days out. We’re going to use it to mask our approach... You two are gonna lead the first wave. Pick your squads, start prepping.

Abby: I want Owen. When are he and Danny getting back?

Isaac: Who talked? Nora? No secrets between the Salt Lake crew, huh?

Abby: Is Owen okay?

Isaac: As far as I know.

Abby: Then why haven’t you sent a search party after him?

Isaac: He shot Danny. Apparently to protect some Scar.

Abby: Bullshit.

Isaac: Excuse me?

Abby: That’s not Owen. You got it wrong.

Isaac: You saying Danny used his last breath to lie to me?

Manny: Sir, people hear that story, Owen’s dead. Anyone who finds him, they’ll gun him down for sport.

Isaac: Then I suggest y’all stop gossiping about it.

Abby: Let me go after him. I’ll walk him back in, we’ll get to the bottom of

Isaac: No.

Abby: You said yourself the storm’s a few days--

Isaac: No! We’ve only got one shot at this. This is bigger than any of us... Definitely bigger than Owen. If he turns up then fine, I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt, and we’ll get to the bottom of it. I need you, Abby. Yeah?

Abby: Yeah. I get it.

Isaac: Good. Look over the plans and go through your roster. Grab some food. We’ll talk later.

[Isaac leaves the room.]

Manny: No way Owen killed Danny over some Scar, right? What? No, Abby. Don’t.

Abby: I’ll be back by morning. You just gotta cover me ‘til then.

Manny: Isaac will kick your ass.

Abby: Not before the assault. You heard him, he needs me.

Manny: If Owen’s out there, how the hell are you going to find him?

Abby: I know where he’ll go.

3 YEARS EARLIER
[Owen and Abby fool around in the booth of a broken Ferris Wheel. Owen is rocking the booth.]

Owen: (laughing)

Abby: Stop it! I’m gonna kill you.

Owen: What?

Abby: Seriously, stop it!

Owen: All right. Why don’t you come on over and enjoy this view with me, then?

Abby: It’s great. It’s the best.

Owen: Oh... Come on. We made it all the way up here, just so you can wimp out on the last two steps?

Abby: Yeah. Yes. The deal was to get up here. So.

Owen: Hmm. All right, here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to get your ass over here, sit on the edge, or you can go down here on the kid’s seat, and look at this view with me.

Abby: (sighs) We can’t miss training.

Owen: Really? Not even just for one night?

Abby: Nope.

Owen: Can we talk about it?

Abby: It’s getting late.

Owen: Yeah. Okay.

[Owen stands to the edge of the booth.]

Abby: Don’t. Don’t-- Do not, it is too high!

Owen: Oh my god. Y’know, I don’t think I can live like this anymore, Abby.

Abby: Owen, I am serious, I will break up with you. Owen...

Owen: I always loved you!

Abby: Don’t - Owen!

[He jumps to his death. Abby shocked. She sees only some ripple in the water far below. She makes the most logical thing in such a situation - jumps after the suicide to... to save him?]

Owen: Abby!

Abby: I’m down here, you asshole.

Owen: You jumped? And I missed it?

Abby: I thought you drowned!

Owen: And you came to my rescue?

Abby: No. I came to make sure you drowned.

Owen: (laughs) Uh, I found something pretty awesome.

Abby: What?

Owen: I think you’re gonna have to follow me to see it.

Abby: Owen, we have to go back.

Owen: We will! Once you see this.

Abby: These people are just starting to warm up to us. You keep showing up late to everything it’ll seem... it’ll seem disrespectful.

Owen: What are they gonna do? Kick out a bunch of displaced Fireflies who have nowhere else to go?

Abby: Maybe? I don’t want to find out.

Owen: Just come see this thing. Take a deep breath...

[They dive a bit and find an aquarium, but it’s underwater.]

Abby: What is this place?

Owen: I don’t know.

Abby: You want to keep going?

Owen: Fuck yeah.

[They dive some more and find the entrance.]

Owen: This place is crazy... I think this is like one of those... zoos, but for fish.

Abby: Shut up.

Owen: (points at a seal) Check this water pup out. I saw this seal the other day. It was covered in spots.

Abby: They don’t have spots, they’re brown.

Owen: Those are sea lions.

Abby: No... No, you don’t know.

Owen: I know what I saw. With my eyes.

Abby: (trying to lift a blinds) Hey, gimme a hand with this.

Owen: Yup. Got it!

Abby: C’mon. What is this place?

Owen: Well, clearly this is some sort of theater... but for, uh, fish. (slides a handrail and howl) Awoooo!

Abby: Are you a rooster?

Owen: What I’m a Wolf! That’s my wolf howl.

Abby: You’re an idiot. You think this sailboat was part of the show?

Owen: Nah. Looks like somebody turned this into a makeshift dock or something. Want to check it out?

Abby: There’s some kids’ clothes. Bet a family came through.

Owen: Look at these drawings!

Abby: I wonder what happened to them.

Owen: Maybe they joined the Wolves?

Abby: Yeah, or got killed by Scars.

Owen: Such an optimist...

Abby: Hmm...

Owen: All right, enough of this boat. You wanna go see the rest of the fish zoo?

Abby: You think there’s more to see?

Owen: Of course! Let’s go.

[Abby jumps in the water.]

Owen: What are you doing? You gonna give me an animal show?

Abby: Um, do I look like a spotted seal?

Owen: It had spots!

Abby: Ugh.

Owen: Think you can get through that?

Abby: Get me up there.

Owen: Yep.

Abby: Here.

Owen: Uh, okay. Holy shit! Look at you!

Abby: Pushed a hundred eighty-five pounds yesterday.

Owen: Yeah right.

Abby: So... we take a quick look around and then...

Owen: We head right back.

Abby: Uh-huh.

Owen: Except that this is nothing, and you’re going to beg me to stay.

Abby: Not happening.

Owen: Just wait. Any fish in there? Wonder if any of these are connected to the ocean...

[They enter the mail exhibition with a whale figure hanging from the ceiling.]

Abby: Oh my god.

Owen: Whoa. You don’t see that every day.

Abby: This place is something else.

Owen: How thick is this glass?

Abby: It’s a tank in the floor.

Owen: Can you imagine this place filled with people? Kids laughing, running around. Different world, right?

Owen: (sits in the reception area) I’m claiming this place. It’s mine. You can visit.

Abby: Oh, you sure?

Owen: Not really, actually. I’ll see how nice you are to me first.

Abby: Mmm.... You’re a dick.

Owen: Not a great start.

Abby: (sees a drawing on the wall) Think it’s the same family from the boat?

Owen: That’d be my guess, yeah.

Abby: Locked.

Owen: We have to come back here with the others,

Abby: That’s good. Get them to break the rules too.

Owen: You don’t think it’s worth it?

Abby: Let’s see how much trouble we’re in when we get back.

Owen: Ha! You love it.

Abby: Shut up.

Owen: So, can I get, like, a, "Owen, you were right. Thanks for dragging me into this amazing place?"

Abby: I’ll think about it.

Owen: I’ll take it.

Abby: (finds a corpse in a chair) Oh god. Think this is our boat captain?

Owen: Shit.

[Abby reads the letter on the corpse.]

Abby: His kids ran off to join the Scars.

Owen: Jeez. Well, on the bright side, we found these keys.

Abby: What is wrong with you?

Owen: He’s a skeleton, he doesn’t need them!

Abby: I just don’t understand how anybody willingly joins the Scars.

Owen: Why not?

Abby: Because they’re an insane cult. That’s why.

Owen: In the QZs people would refer to the Fireflies as terrorists. Fanatics.

Abby: We were naive. We weren’t... fanatical.

Owen: We blew up checkpoints and assassinated soldiers.

Abby: It’s not the same.

Owen: I’m just saying...

Abby: Don’t say shit like that at the stadium, okay?

Owen: Okay, all right, all right.

Abby: What time do you think it is?

Owen: I don’t know. We got time.

Abby: Wanna try those keys?

Owen: Oh, yeah. This one? Nope. How about... got it!

[They enter some room called “Max’s Place”.]

Owen: Damn. Painting this must’ve taken forever.

[They find an elevator shaft.]

Abby: Don’t tell me you want to go down there.

Owen: Come on!

Abby: Owen...

Owen: Last thing! I promise.

Abby: Last thing.

[Owen takes her hand and they go down the shaft.]

Owen: Just, uh, don’t look down.

Abby: (sighs) Ugh. Just go.

Owen: (laughs) You’re good. Look at these. I’d love to meet this kid.

Abby: I mean... He’s a Scar. Maybe you have.

Owen: Uh, Jesus, I sure hope not. Whoa! Get on in here.

Abby: Wow.

[Abby sees the real seal.]

Owen: Yeah... You see that? Told you they were spotted.

Abby: Yeah, yeah.

[They kiss and slowly go to the next level, but Abby pouches Owen away.]

Owen: You want me to slow down?

Abby: No.

Owen: (points to his abs) Is it this? It’s this, isn’t it? You are disgusted by it. C’mon, Abs.

Abby: I’m sorry.

Owen: Don’t be sorry. Talk to me.

Abby: I know all the leads have dried up... but... But Joel’s still out there, you know?

Owen: I know. What can I do?

Abby: Let’s go back. We can still make training.

Owen: You go ahead.

Abby: What about you?

Owen: Um... I’m going to hang out with the seals for a little while.

Abby: I’m sorry.

Owen: I told you already... don’t be sorry.

[She is leaving. Some time passes. Abby meets Manny on the roof. It’s time to lure Joel into a trap.]

Manny: What if Owen’s somewhere else?

Abby: He’s there.

Manny: Let’s get off the roof before someone sees us. Can I talk you out of this?

Abby: No. We don’t know what happened. I gotta find him.

Manny: I mean... If he really killed Danny...

Abby: Fuck Danny. I’m jealous Owen got to shoot him before I did.

Manny: Whoa, Abby.

Abby: I do appreciate you helping me sneak out like this.

Manny: How are you getting to the aquarium? The highway?

Abby: Can’t. Too many patrols. I’d get spotted for sure. I’ll rough it. Aquarium’s due west of here. Keep following the sun, right?

Manny: I’m coming with you.

Abby: I’ve done this before.

Manny: Not with this many Scars in the area.

Abby: Manny, please.

Manny: All right. You know best. Abs. What’re you doing?

Abby: Did you know someone’s squatting here? (reads Manny’s letter) Oh... no! "Whispering... Spanish in my ear"? Hey!

[Takes the letter out of her hands.]

Manny: Hey! That’s private.

Abby: Oh my god! This is your place? How many sex dens do you have in this QZ?

Manny: ¿Qué? Perdón. No hablo inglés. (What? Sorry. I don’t speak English.) Down this way.

Abby: Hey. Thanks.

Manny: For this?

Abby: Yeah... and other stuff, y’know? You’re a good friend.

Manny: Come on, Abs. You know I can’t handle all this emotion. Looks clear. C’mon.

[Abby jumps over the fence.]

Abby: All right, wish me luck.

Manny: When you find him, don’t hit him too hard.

Abby: I’ll do my best.

Manny: Seriously, watch yourself out there.

Abby: See ya.

[She continues on her own.]

Abby: Okay... just follow the sunset. (hears gunshots) Great. Ugh... What is that smell? (finds martial arts guidebook) This’ll come in handy… (finds a letter) Yeah, no. You can rot here. Oh, nice. Oh shit! (kills an undead) Off to a great start. (sees “May she guide us” mural) What the hell? Yeah, guide you right off a cliff. These freaks are in our backyard. (hears the horde) Oh no. Great timing. Yeah. That it? Yeah, that’s it. (cracked a safe) It actually worked. God damn it. (hears an undead) Just stay outta my way. (kills some) All right. Two down... Millions to go. You’ve been here a while... If you want your family safe, maybe don’t join a death cult? (finds a note) Huh. (finds Relic of the Sages from Jak & Daxter) What is this? (kills an undead that attacked her from behind) Oh shit! Asshole. (finds a double barrel shotgun) Fuck yeah! This’ll help. Ah, shit...! (smashes chinese pottery) Made a mess of this place. (leves the building) Martyr’s Gate... The truce is dead, but you just keep coming back here… (finds someone’s weapon stash) Whoa…

[She walks to the gates to which many notes with different requests are attached.]

Abby: (finds a note) You want peace? Easy. Stay on your island. (finds a note) She’s not a genie, dude. (finds a note) Okay, at least that one’s a practical request. (finds a note) That’s a big ask, dude. (finds a note) Ooh, someone wants to get laid. (finds a note)Isaac... You turned a crazy person into a martyr.

[She goes further and stumbles upon a convoy of fanatics.]

Abby: Whoa! Shit.

Seraphite: Check the other structures. Clear the path to Martyr’s Gate.

Seraphite: Luca. Come with me. You two, take the other side. May she protect us all.

Seraphite: Is this really the farthest you’ve been from Haven?

Seraphite: Yes. I spent a year in the watchtowers, and the Elders agreed I was ready.

Seraphite: Put eyes everywhere.

[The fanatics see Abby.]

Abby: (hiding) Okay. (killing) Quiet. (killing) Shh. Quiet. (killing) Shh. Shut up. Ugh.

Seraphite: Scour this entire area, Every building.

Abby: (killing) Not a word. Shut it. Now. (killing) Shh. Quiet. (killing) Shh. Quiet down. All right. Fuck. Hope Owen didn’t come this way... What’s all this? Of course I walked right into a Scar camp. (finds a letter) That’s sweet... In a fucked-up kind of way.

Seraphite: The Elders will be pleased to have a camp so close to Martyr’s Gate.

[Some fanatic hits Abby and she falls unconscious.]

4 MONTHS EARLIER
[Abby walks to the door of the same aquarium she was in with Owen earlier.]

Abby: (knocks on the door) Owen! Owen! Hey.

Owen: Hey. Everything all right?

Abby: Yeah. This a bad time?

Owen: No. No. So... what’s up? We got orders?

Abby: Sort of.

Owen: Sort of? You know what, just... How about we hold off on the Isaac talk for just a minute?

Abby: Owen--

Owen: When’s the last time you were here? Look around. Take it all in.

Abby: What did you do?

Owen: You know... just rip out some vines, paint some walls...

Abby: You’re not painting over Max’s mural?

Owen: I’m... embellishing it.

Abby: You’ve really moved up from graffitiing Firefly tags.

Owen: Oh! Did you hear another Firefly joined last month?

Abby: Ex-Firefly.

Owen: Well, she’d also heard about a regroup in Santa Barbara.

Abby: Was there any proof to go along with that rumor?

Owen: No.

Abby: How about that?

Owen: Abigail! What are you doing?

Abby: You know you’re the only person who calls me that, right?

[Abby finds a toy bow.]

Abby: What’s this?

Owen: Oh yeah, Mel and I have this competition thing going. Oh, uh, I don’t think you would enjoy it. It’s pretty complicated.

Abby: I see what you’re doing. And it’s working! What do I do?

Owen: Okay... See those targets?

Abby: Yeah.

Owen: Just hit as many as you can before the time’s up.

Abby: Pfft. I win, you better write my name up there.

Owen: You got it. Shake it off.

Abby: That’s one!

Owen: Yeah, proud of you.

Abby: Two down.

Owen: And more to go. Oh, good for you. Aww. Holy shit. Five. Halfway there, Abs. Wow! Isaac would be ashamed. Hey... easy on the art.

Abby: What? I’m making it better.

Owen: Ouch. Like... deep inside of me ouch. 30 seconds. Two to beat me, no pressure. I’m, like, actually very proud right now. You only need one more! Just 10 seconds left. Five... Four... Three... Two... One... One...

Abby: I did it! Ha! First try! How do you like me now?

Owen: (fake clapping) Yeah... it’s great. You’re good at everything...

Abby: Shut up and put me up on the wall.

Owen: I will... Later.

Abby: Oh-- Are you scared of Mel finding out I was here?

Owen: No! She doesn’t care.

Abby: So put me up on the board, Owen.

Owen: All right... Calm down. (write Abby’s score) Okay, there’s one last thing I want you to see. Come upstairs.

Abby: Is it that boat captain’s body? ‘Cause I saw it last time. You didn’t put a Santa hat on it, did you?

Owen: Wh-What? No. That would actually be kind of cool. This is even cooler. Come on. After you.

[He takes her to another room decorated with fir and other Christmas decorations.]

Abby: What is all this? Festive.

Owen: You gotta get the full effect. Have a seat. Take in that view.

[He gives Abby a cup.]

Owen: Now... try that. Well?

Abby: The view is nice

Owen: Oh, whatever. Philistine.

Abby: You want me to lie?

[She walks to a bunch of Christmas’ socks.]

Owen: Yes. Obviously. Uh... She’s into this Christmas thing and... it’s our one year. So...

Abby: I think it’s adorable.

Owen: I think you can go fuck yourself.

Abby: No, I wish... someone loved me enough to make me a stocking,

Owen: You don’t deserve one.

Abby: What? A stocking? Or someone who loves me?

Owen: Why are you in such a good mood?

Abby: Am I?

Owen: You should blow off training tonight. Abby, when the moon comes out--

Abby: I found Joel’s brother. He’s at a settlement out in Wyoming.

Owen: How do you know that?

Abby: Some Fireflies who served with him got picked up at the wall.

Owen: I thought he quit like a decade ago.

Abby: Yeah...

Owen: So... have these guys heard from him since?

Abby: It’s a lead. I gotta see it through.

Owen: Okay, but you know that even if he is there, and you do find him, he might not know where Joel is, right? You tell the others?

Abby: Everyone’s on board. Mel included. We can leave next week.

Owen: Isaac’s never going to let that many people go off base.

Abby: He already did.

Owen: Bullshit.

Abby: Who’s more about justice than Isaac? He knows what Joel’s done. Hey. We’re doing this together, right?

Owen: Course.

[We get back to captured Abby. Two fanatics drag her tied in the rainy night.]

Abby: No--

[One of them puts a rope on Abby’s neck and lifts her into the air. Another fanatic puts a small barrel under her feet.]

Seraphite: (pulls out a knife) They are nested with sin. Free them... that they may know my--

[She puts a knife to Abby’s stomach but here two fanatics bring a black girl.]

Seraphite: Yara. Where is the other apostate? (the girl spits in her face) Clip her wings.

[They press the black girl to the ground and one of the fanatics with several blows of a hammer crushes the bone in her left arm. He passes the hammer to another fanatic, but someone kills him by shooting arrows in the face. The girl kills the first fanatic with the hammer. Abby grabs the leader with her legs. The black girl throws a hammer at the leader’s head and kills her, after which she falls to the ground in pain. A small barrel falls out from under Abby’s feet and she starts to choke. Meanwhile, an Asian boy with a bow comes out of the forest.]

Seraphite: Here.

Kid: Yara! Yara... Demons are coming.

Yara: Cut her down.

Kid: She’s one of them--

Yara: Lev!

[The kid helps Abby.]

Abby: (grabs the hammer) Watch your backs.

[They fight off some screaming undead.]

Yara: Wolf! Come on! We have to move!

Abby: Where are you going?

Yara: Out of these woods! We gotta run! Now! Coast is this way! Lev, they’re all around us!

Lev: Get off!

Yara: That was the last of ‘em.

Abby: You two okay?

Lev: Yeah.

Yara: We have to keep moving before more come.

Abby: Every direction looks the same. You sure you know where you’re going?

Yara: It has to be this way...

Abby: What the hell am I doing?

[She ran after Yara with a torch.]

Yara: It’s just up here!

[They run out of the forest and climb over the roadblock.]

Abby: (sees some corpses) Those are fresh. There another way around?

Lev: If there were, would we be going this way?

Yara: Come on, Lev. Get it open!

Abby: Move. Go.

Lev: I got you.

[Abby bends the metal fence with her hands and Yara and Lev go further. While Abby crawls herself, one of the fanatics attacks Yara. Abby runs up to the fanatics and attacks her.]

Seraphite: Hyyaaa! You!

Abby: Are you wearing my backpack?

[She smashes her head with the hammer.]

Seraphite: No!! Wait--!

Abby: (takes her backpack) Got it. You guys all right?

Lev: Yes.

Abby: Go on. How’s the arm?

Yara: I have it under control.

Abby: Okay. Grab any supplies you find.

Lev: We can’t touch this stuff. It’s Old World.

Abby: Are you f--? Ugh. You need supplies. We’re not out of the woods yet. Pun fucking intended.

Lev: What’s a pun?

Abby: Never seen Scars going after Scars before.

Lev: Seraphites.

Abby: What the hell did you do?

Lev: I shaved my head.

Abby: Fine, don’t tell me. I really don’t care. (finds “Bring Your Own Bullets” book) Been wanting to read something like this....

Yara: We’re almost to the coast. Just a little farther!

Lev: Demons!

Abby: Stay behind me.

[She kills some undead.]

Lev: Dead ahead!

Abby: Ready!

Lev: Ugh.

Abby: Now what?

Yara: I’m quite confident it’s this way.

Abby: Quite confident?

Lev: You don’t have to follow us.

Abby: You want me to leave you two out here alone?

Yara: Let’s just... Let’s just get out of here.

Abby: I get you through, you open that gate, right?

Yara: We’ll open it.

Abby: Come on. Your turn. Watch that arm.

[Abby boosts Yara up the gate.]

Yara: The gate’s stuck!

Abby: Fuck! Hurry up! (to herself) Can’t believe I trusted Scars.

Lev: Wolf! Over here!

Abby: Go!

Lev: More of them.

Yara: Just... Just gimme a minute.

Abby: You’re going to hold on tight.

[She picks up Yara.]

Yara: Okay. Ahh, my arm!

Abby: I know. Focus on your breathing. In and out. Nice and steady. (to Lev) Try the doors. Make sure there are no infected.

Lev: It won’t open.

Abby: Try the other ones. Any luck?

Lev: No! Wolf! In here! Let’s get inside before someone sees.

Abby: Lock it.

[They find some safe place. Abby puts Yara on the sofa.]

Yara: Come help me with this. Hey. It just needs to be set. ‘Kay? (to Abby) You know how to do that?

Abby: Cut that into strips. Lean back.

Yara: Okay.

Abby: I’m gonna move it, okay?

Yara: Okay.

Abby: You ready? Okay...

[Abby sets the crushed bone with a hammer, breaks the chair leg and makes a bandage.]

Yara: What’s your name?

Abby: Abby. Thanks for cutting me down.

[She walks to the door.]

Abby: This area gets a lot of traffic. Whatever shape she’s in... you need to get out of here by tomorrow.

Lev: We’ll be fine.

[He closes the door.]

Abby: Yeah. All right. Owen. Aquarium’s right there. Let’s do it. (finds a gun holster) Yes. (falls from a cliff) Oh god--! Fuck. Now what? (finds a way out) Come on. It’s right over there. (jumps into the water) That current’s rough. (climbs on a boat and finds a couple of corpses) Ugh. In their sleep. Fuck. (finds a skeleton with a crossbow) Okay. Did you kill all those people? (tries the crossbow) Nice. All right. Is this whole damn boat infested? (cracks a safe) Got it. Need to get off this boat. Here we go... (she gets back to the ground) Let’s try this again. Ugh. Hello? Huh. Maybe...? The shit I do for you... (breaks a window) Swear to god if you give me shit about this glass... Okay. (finds Owen’s backpack) Okay, your pack’s here. Is that blood? Hey. Owen? Owen! God damn it. Of course. Owen?

[She finds Owen on the boat where they found the kid’s drawings many months ago. Ge’s drunk.]

Owen: That’s fucking cruel... (laughs) Isaac sends you after me.

Abby: He didn’t. What is all this?

Owen: Gotta take her apart if I’m gonna fix her back up.

Abby: I see.

Owen: Want some?

Abby: Pass.

Owen: Suit yourself.

Abby: Danny’s dead.

Owen: Figured.

Abby: You wanna tell me what happened?

Owen: We were cleaning out a small camp. Just a couple of Scars and uh... I hit this one on the head. Hard. And he goes down. And his weapon is right there. And he doesn’t go for it. Instead he... turns to me. And he’s old. And tired. He was just... ready. I’ve killed a lot of Scars. And uh... This fucking guy. I couldn’t do it. Of course, Danny gets in my fucking face about it. I told him I’m done. He can do it himself if he wants. Then he points his fucking gun at me. So I grab it and then... At first, I didn’t even know which one of us was shot.

Abby: You defended yourself.

Owen: Stop--

Abby: I can fix this. I’ll talk to Isaac--

Owen: I am tired, Abby. I don’t want to fight over land that I don’t give a fuck about anymore. I’m going to Santa Barbara.

Abby: To chase a rumor?

Owen: I’ve heard it more than once.

Abby: The Fireflies aren’t regrouping. They’re gone.

Owen: It’s a lead... I gotta see it through.

Abby: What about Mel?

Owen: She’ll be safe here.

Abby: Okay. We’ll talk in the morning, when you’re sober.

Owen: Don’t do that.

Abby: Do what?

Owen: Treat me like I’m fucking insane. You feel the same way.

Abby: If the Fireflies are in Santa Barbara… I go the opposite fucking direction. What?

Owen: Nothing.

Abby: Sorry I grew up.

Owen: (scoffs)

Abby: You should try it.

Owen: Oh yeah? How do I do that, Abby? Should I go find the people that killed my family? Cut into ‘em? I can torture them until they’re crying in their own--

[Abby grabs Owen for his T-shirt. They take out their anger on each other for a few seconds.]

Owen: Abby.

[They kiss and have 3 seconds sexy time. Abby falls asleep. In me she returns to the hospital, where Joel killed her father, but instead of his corpse, she finds Yara and Lev hangs under the ceiling.]

Abby: What?

[She wakes up. Owen sleeps next to her.]

Abby: (gasp) Those fucking kids...

SEATTLE DAY 2
[Abby’s on the roof of some building. She’s going to help the kids.]

Seraphite: (distant whistles)

Abby: Shit! Need to get them out of there before it’s too late. What the hell am I doing? They’re fucking Scars... Not falling. Okay.

Seraphite: Are you sure you saw them?

Abby: Fuck.

Seraphite: It was the apostate.

Abby: At least I know he’s alive.

Seraphite: That child is an abomination.

Seraphite: What about their mother?

Seraphite: I heard she was abstaining from food and water as penance.

Seraphite: Poor woman.

Seraphite: She raised them.

Seraphite: She’s taught them well... some children are born cursed.

Abby: I hope they’re still there.

[She neatly passes by fanatics and comes to the house, where she left Yara and Leva. At the door, there is a corpse with an arrow in its head.]

Abby: Oh, shit. Kid? You still there?

[Someone shoots an arrow at Abby.]

Lev: Don’t come any closer!

Abby: It’s me!

Lev: Sorry.

Abby: How’s she doin’?

[Lev looks at the floor. Abby comes to Yara and sees that she has a fever. She is barely alive.]

Abby: I’m going to move your arm. Lean into me.

Lev: Where are you taking her?

Abby: C’mon.

Lev: What are you doing?

Abby: I’m giving her a chance.

[She carries Yara to the Aquarium. Lev follows her.]

Abby: Owen. Owen! Hey. Owen, wake up!

Owen: I’m here. Are those Scars?

Abby: I need whatever medical supplies you have.

[Dog runs out of the corridor with barking.]

Abby: Alice, no!

Owen: Alice.

Abby: (to Lev) Put the bow down! It’s okay!

Owen: Put that down!

Abby: Alice, shut up! Put the bow down!

Owen: Alice, stop-- Abby, what the fuck?!

Mel: Alice!

Abby: Lev, lower the bow. It’s okay.

Mel: Abby, who are these kids?

Abby: They saved my life. Can you take a look at her?

Mel: Stay, Alice.

Abby: This is Yara.

Mel: What did this?

Abby: A hammer. It wasn’t me.

Mel: Let’s lay her down.

[They take Yara to the operating room. Mel touches Yara’s swollen hand.]

Mel: Can you feel this? Yara.

Yara: No.

Abby: I was going to clean it and try resetting--

Mel: The bone’s shattered. She has compartment syndrome.

Lev: What does that mean?

Abby: It means it has to come off.

Lev: She’s a soldier. You can’t take her arm!

Mel: We leave it, it’ll turn gangrenous.

Yara: Just make it stop hurting. Please.

Abby: What do you need?

Mel: Ideally? A saw, sutures, clamps, antibiotics... But we’re far from ideal right now.

Owen: We have knives. Fire. Cut and cauterize it.

Abby: She would die from infection. Make me a list. I’ll go to the hospital and get whatever you need.

Mel: It’ll take you all day to get there--

Abby: I don’t mind!

Mel: It’s not about you, Abby. She doesn’t have a couple of days.

Lev: What if I can get you there in two hours? The Wolf hospital, right? On the west side?

Owen: How?

Lev: We built bridges high up. It’s how we get around the flooding and... you people,

Abby: Can she handle two hours?

Mel: Probably, yeah

Abby: So make the list.

Owen: Wait. Are you serious? These bridges are used by Scars.

Lev: They only send in small groups at a time.

Abby: You heard that? Small groups.

Owen: This isn’t a joke.

Abby: Lev.

Yara: (to Lev) May she guide you.

Lev: May she protect you.

Owen: Abby. Abby! Hey!

Abby: What?

Owen: You steal my keys?

Abby: Sorry.

Owen: Can I... talk to you?

Abby: Talk.

Owen: Why are you doing this? Look, she just showed up.

Abby: Okay.

Owen: I don’t think she knows about last night--

Abby: --I don’t care about last night.

Owen: Well, I do.

Abby: Which one?

[Owen opens the door.]

Owen: I hope you know what you’re doing.

[Abby and Lev leave the base.]

Lev: Your friends are Wolves too?

Abby: Yeah. We were lucky Mel was there. She’s one of the best surgeons in Seattle.

Lev: Mel... And what’s his name? The man?

Abby: Owen.

Lev: Mel. Owen. Abby.

Abby: And the dog’s Alice.

Lev: I don’t like dogs. How do we get to the really tall buildings? The bridge is there.

Abby: Path ahead kicks out toward downtown. The really tall buildings. You gonna be able to get us the rest of the way?

Lev: The route starts at the edge of the rushing water. You get us there, and I can take over.

Abby: These bridges are really gonna get us over the rapids?

Lev: Yeah.

Abby: All of them?

Lev: Yes.

Abby: In just a couple hours?

Lev: I’m not lying.

Abby: Okay.

Lev: Wolf! There it is! That’s the building we need to get to.

Abby: ‘Kay, I see it.

Lev: What happens if we can’t get the stuff your friend needs?

Abby: Uh... she’ll have to try and do the surgery with what Owen has around. It’s not... That wouldn’t be good.

Lev: Do you think she’ll make it?

Abby: We get these supplies... Yeah, she’ll… Have a good shot. Do you know our dogs can play cards like that?

Lev: I’m thirteen. Not eight.

Abby: You’re the size of an eight year old.

Lev: Do other people think you’re funny?

Abby: ...No.

Lev: What’s compartment syndrome?

Abby: If too much pressure builds up in your muscles, the blood can’t move in and out of the tissue.

Lev: Tissue?

Abby: Kind of like the skin inside your body.

Lev: How do you know all that?

Abby: I grew up around doctors. Like Mel. Let’s see if we can get to the top of this building. You’ve been to these sky bridges before, right?

Lev: Yeah.

Abby: You think we’re gonna see a lot of Scars?

Lev: Seraphites. I don’t know.

Abby: You gonna be okay if we do?

Lev: I was yesterday.

Abby: Yeah, but those guys were hunting you.

Lev: They’re all hunting us.

Abby: Watch the glass. Oh fuck. We’re gonna have to do a little zig-zagging. How long have you two been on the run for?

Lev: Two days.

Abby: Where were you headed?

Lev: I dunno. Just... away.

Abby: What the hell did you do?

Lev: I shaved my head.

Abby: They want to kill a little boy because he shaved his head?

Lev: I wasn’t allowed. It’s a rule. I broke it.

Abby: Jeez. So why’d you do it?

Lev: I dunno...

Abby: Pretty punk rock of you. Hmm.

Lev: Punk rock?

Abby: I get the impression you don’t follow most rules.

Lev: Oh... I guess so...

Abby: (finds some arrows) Cool.

Lev: Huh.

Abby: How long you been using that thing?

Lev: My bow? Since forever.

Abby: You’re good with it.

Lev: You should’ve seen Yara.

Abby: Shit!

Lev: Demons. It’s down.

Abby: You okay?

Lev: Yes. How many Seraphites have you killed?

Abby: Why?

Lev: Curious.

Abby: I don’t know.

Abby: That water’s picked up a lot of speed. I need you to be really careful, okay?

Lev: I’ve done stuff like this before.

Abby: God damn it.

Lev: Who is he?

Abby: I dunno.

Lev: Isn’t he a Wolf?

Abby: There are thousands of us. Do you know every Scar?

Lev: Stop calling us Scars.

Abby: Sure. This where we’re supposed to be?

Lev: Yeah. This building’ll take us to the building next door. Hmm...

Abby: Where to now?

Lev: I don’t know.

Abby: What do you mean?

Lev: This is the right building, but I’ve never been to this part of it. The bridge drops us off at the back of the building. This is new to me.

Abby: Okay, well, let’s see if we can find our own way down....

Lev: My ears are ringing.

Abby: If that’s the worst of it, we got off lucky.

Lev: Maybe it wasn’t luck.

Abby: Maybe it was.

Lev: Some Wolves believe in God. I’ve heard them pray. Can I ask you a question?

Abby: (cracks a safe) Got it. Here’s our way down.

Lev: If we get to the street, we’ll be right by the hospital.

Abby: Just a body.

Lev: One of yours?

Abby: No. Check out the clothes. Here. (gives Lev a flashlight) Looks dark down there.

Lev: Oh. I see how this works.

Abby: (reads a note) Had orders to clear out this building. Lev, are there infected in this building?

Lev: We always take elevators down to the bottom, so I don’t know.

Abby: Spores. Masks on.

Lev: I don’t have one.

Abby: Do you guys not believe in gas masks?

Lev: We were on the run.

Abby: Let me see what I can find. Stay here. Back up. All the way.

Lev: If you die, I’ll be stuck here.

Abby: Better start praying I make it.

[She enters a spore infested area of the building.]

Abby: Okay, gas mask... gas mask... Shit... Just stay up there, okay? Finally! Ugh. If you’re going to kill yourself, don’t ruin the mask. Dick. Yes! Looks good. All right, back to Lev. Oh fuck. All right...

[She gets back to Lev.]

Abby: Got you a present. Here.

[She puts the mask on Lev.]

Lev: We’re taking too long.

Abby: Can’t move any faster. It won’t do your sister any good if we’re both dead. There. We got this.

[They enter the spores infested area together.]

Lev: Did you see a way down?

Abby: No.

Lev: Abby. What about that?

Abby: Huh. Is that a firehose? Lev, come get this down.

Lev: Coming.

Abby: I’m going to head down.

Lev: Be careful.

Abby: C’mon... you got this...

Lev: Now what?

Abby: Follow me.

Lev: May the current be calm.

[Some undead attacks Abby.]

Abby: God...

Lev: Get off her!

[Lev saves her.]

Abby: Holy shit. Thanks.

Lev: That thing was growing into the wall.

Abby: Until it fucking wasn’t.

Lev: I hate demons.

Abby: Tell me about it. How many more floors down do you think we have to go?

Lev: I don’t know... it’s a big building...

Abby: Yeah... Watch it!

Lev: Behind you!

Abby: (takes a flamethrower from a soldier’s corpse) Thank you, FEDRA. Hear anything else?

Lev: No. You?

Abby: No.

Lev: Good. Let’s keep going.

Abby: I hate this. Lev. I hate this building.

Lev: Keep going down, we’re almost at the street.

Abby: Okay. Progress. Lev, you doing all right?

Lev: Yeah. Are you?

Abby: If I’m being honest? Not my best day. Holy shit.

Lev: There are too many demons.

Abby: Just keep looking for a way out of here.

Abby: Ready!

Lev: Behind you, behind you!

Abby: They’re not getting through that. Let’s go.

Lev: What is that?

Abby: A quarter.

Lev: A quarter of what?

Abby: (snorts)

Lev: What?

Abby: (deep breath) You can take your mask off.

Lev: You see that elevator right there?

Abby: Let’s get out of here.

Lev: Let’s not tell the others about what happened. I don’t want Yara to worry.

Abby: You’re a good brother… Can I ask you a question?

Lev: Okay.

Abby: Do you regret shaving your head?

Lev: We’re not supposed to have regrets.

Abby: Lev...

Lev: I wish I’d just ran away. Then Yara wouldn’t be caught in all of this. She’d be back home, taking care of our mom.

Abby: Does your mom... need taking care of?

Lev: She’s our mom... It’s our duty.

Abby: This is as far as you go.

Lev: What? Wait, why?

Abby: Because they want to kill you. With me they’re just worried about a backgammon rematch.

Lev: What’s backgammon?

Abby: I’m gonna go in the front door, grab the stuff, come right back. You’re staying here. Yeah?

Lev: Yeah...

[Abby jumps off the building and swims to the hospital.]

WLF Soldier: Got someone in the water!

WLF Soldier: Trespasser?

Abby: I’m a Wolf! Don’t shoot! It’s me! It’s Abby!

WLF Soldier: Abby? It’s Abby! Shit!

WLF Soldier: She alone?

WLF Soldier: Open the gate!

Abby: Hey guys.

WLF Soldier: Jesus, you swim here?

Abby: Eh, boat got fucked. I need to grab some medical supplies, I’m doin’ a thing for Isaac.

WLF Soldier: We’re moving all these assets to Isaac. What does he need?

Abby: Um, can’t talk about it. It’s something away from the FOB.

WLF Soldier: Well, everything’s getting moved out and packed up. Take a look, see if anyone’s got what you need.

Abby: Hey, is Nora around? Yesterday she said she was shipping out here.

WLF Soldier: Just left with the last transport, but she’ll be back.

Abby: Okay, thanks.

WLF Soldier: He shot Danny?

WLF Soldier: If he’s lucky, Scars’ll find him first.

WLF Soldier: Fucking traitor.

Abby: You still clearing this place?

WLF Soldier: Yup. One floor at a time.

Abby: Still got supplies in there?

[She enters the hospital. Some chinese girl is digging in a box.]

Abby: Hey.

WLF Soldier: Abby. They got you out here too?

Abby: Yeah, what a haul. I need some medical supplies. Can you point me where I’m--

[A couple of armed men enter.]

WLF Soldier: Abby! Just checked in with Isaac. He wants you back at the FOB.

Abby: Let me talk to Isaac.

WLF Soldier: Talk to him in person. You’re going back with the next shipment. Sorry.

WLF Soldier: What are you doing?

WLF Soldier: She’s been AWOL since yesterday. Give me your hands.

Abby: Shit.

[She obeys. The guy handcuffs her. In the next scene, Abby sits handcuffed in an elevator.]

Abby: Hey! Hey! Let me the fuck out! God damn it.

Nora: You’re going to dislocate your shoulder.

Abby: Nora.

Nora: Wow. I never thought I’d see you on Isaac’s bad side. You find Owen at the aquarium? I talked to Manny.

[She releases Abby.]

Abby: I need some medical supplies.

Nora: Why, what happened to him?

Abby: Compartment syndrome. Bashed forearm.

Nora: You’re not treating him, are you?

Abby: Mel. We don’t have a lot of time.

Nora: (reads Abby’s list) Jesus. Most of these supplies have been packed and shipped already.

Abby: What?

Nora: We haven’t cleared out the lower floors yet...

Abby: Will they have what I need?

Nora: Yeah, probably, but... It’s rough down there.

Abby: I’ll be fine.

Nora: You get caught - I had nothing to do with this.

Abby: Of course.

[She follows Nora.]

Nora: All right, come on. Compartment syndrome. Fuck.

Abby: Yeah.

Nora: Boy’s lucky he’s dating a doctor. Mel doing okay?

Abby: Fine.

Nora: She was so fucked up after Isaac talked to her.

Abby: Isaac talked to her?

Nora: After he found out you left base, Isaac interrogated all of us. He was rough on her.

Abby: Did anyone talk?

Nora: No.

WLF Soldier: Nora!

Nora: Where’re you two going?

WLF Soldier: To grab Abby. The boat’s ready to head out.

Nora: I still got, uh, boxes on the third floor. Can you two bring ‘em first?

WLF Soldier: The boat’s pretty full.

Nora: Come on, I don’t want to be here all day.

WLF Soldier: Fine.

Nora: Thanks! They’re gone. And you’re okay?

Abby: Always.

Nora: Manny’s been worried sick about you.

Abby: He know I’m here?

Nora: I bet he will soon. So what’s Owen’s plan once Mel gets that arm off? Hold up. All clear. So... What’s Owen’s plan once Mel gets that arm off?

Abby: Um, he’s been talking about Santa Barbara.

Nora: He knows that’s all bullshit, right? God, I feel so bad for Mel.

Abby: Yeah... me too.

Nora: All right. These floors have the ICU, the Trauma Center, and a few surgical suites.

Abby: Sounds perfect.

Nora: There’s a reason we haven’t touched this area yet. It was ground zero for the whole city... Where they brought the first infected before anyone knew better. It’s gonna be overgrown to shit.

Abby: Awesome.

Nora: Worst case... Look for ambulances. They’re contained, and I’ve gotten lucky before.

Abby: Good idea.

[They approach the door to the contaminated area.]

Nora: May your survival be long.

Abby: May my death be swift.

Nora: See you back at base. Soon, I hope.

Abby: Yeah.

[Abby begins her hunt for medicines.]

Abby: Okay. Surgery, Trauma, ICU... Let’s do this. God. (reads a note) Shit. They had no idea what they were up against... This doesn’t look so bad... (reads a note) You fought the good fight. (reads a note) Glad I wasn’t around during the outbreak... ER. The Trauma Center’s gonna be in there. Ugh. What the fuck did I walk into? Surgery. Great. I hear you... Fuck... Could use Lev in here. Or Manny. Yeah, Manny. Manny would’ve been great. Here goes. (starts a generator) Yes! Okay. No one’s dying here today... What? (searches for medications) C’mon, give me something. Nada. Please let there be an ambulance in the garage. (gasp) The fuck did this? Don’t panic... Get the shit and get outta here. Bingo. That’s good. Don’t fail me now. (finds the medications) Yes! Oh, thank god. Lev, get ready to celebrate.

[At this moment a huge fat mutant undead bursts into the ambulance. Abby climbs onto the driver’s seat and tries to break down the door.]

Abby: Come on! Open, you piece of shit!

[She runs for her life.]

Abby: Jesus Christ! Get away! Holy fuck, holy fucking fuck! No no no! Come on, come on... No--!!

[The monster grabs Abby. She slashes it with her machete.]

Abby: Get! Off! All right.

[The monster lets Abby go. She is forced to fight with it.]

Abby: How the fuck am I going to kill you? Die, damn it! Fuck you! Fuck both of you! Yeah! You like that? I am not dying here! Good riddance. There’s gotta be a way out of here. It’s still alive. Oh. Great. That’s that.

[Abby fires most of her ammunition into the monster. It falls on the wet floor.]

Abby: Fuck this place. Okay. There. No one is ever going to believe that shit. (deep breath) Hope Yara’s doing okay.

[She leaves the building and meets Lev.]

Abby: Wha-- ?

Lev: They’re all looking for you. What did you do?

Abby: Nothing. I told you to stay put!

Lev: I couldn’t! Your "friends" are all over the place. Did you get the stuff?

Abby: Yeah. Now we just need to get the hell out of here. Hey. Follow me.

[They board a boat and sail away to the Aquarium.]

Abby: Hey, Alice... Hey. (to Lev) You want to pet her? It’s okay. Yeah, see?

[Owen approaches.]

Owen: All done. You can go see her now if you want.

[Lev runs away.]

Abby: Is she gonna be okay?

Owen: Yeah, actually. (to Alice) Hey.

Abby: They’re just kids.

Owen: I know.

Abby: What happened to us?

Owen: Maybe we stopped looking for the light.

Abby: Maybe... I’m gonna go check on the girl.

Owen: ‘Kay.

[She comes to check on Yara. Her hand is already cut off to her elbow. Then Abby goes to bed. In her dream, she’s at the hospital where her father was killed. But now she... ...finds him alive.]

SEATTLE DAY 3
[Abby wakes up. She hears some conversation from afar.]

Yara: Even if you make it, she’s not going to come with you.

Lev: I can convince her.

Yara: We broke the rules, Lev! That’s all she’ll care about!

Mel: Owen?

Abby: Just me. What are you still doing up?

Mel: I was changing Yara’s bandages.

Abby: Can’t believe she’s on her feet already.

Mel: Yeah, well, Scars are tough.

Abby: What are they fighting about?

Lev: No, fuck you, Yara! I wouldn’t leave you behind!

Mel: Lev doesn’t want to leave Seattle. Owen invited them to come to Santa Barbara.

Abby: That... is very Owen. I figured you’d’ve talked him out of going by now.

Mel: Actually. I’m going with them... But not if you come.

Abby: What?

Mel: He may fall for your little act with these kids, but I don’t.

Abby: There’s nothing to fall for.

Mel: Isaac’s top Scar killer suddenly had a change of heart? Nothing to do with Owen, right?

Abby: I haven’t always done the right thing--

Mel: You’re a piece of shit, Abby. You always have been. I’m done with you. You want to do right by these kids? Get out of their lives before you screw them over too.

[She leaves.]

Abby: (kicks a chair) Fuck. (cries a bit)

Yara: Abby?

Abby: Nice shirt.

Yara: Are you... are you okay?

Abby: How’s your arm?

Yara: It’s better than it was this morning.

Abby: Lev coming around?

Yara: He will.

Abby: Yeah.

Yara: Do you mind helping me look for him? He’s pretty worked up.

Abby: Sure.

Yara: He ran off this way. Lev! Lev! Come back here please!

Abby: Why doesn’t Lev wanna go to Santa Barbara?

Yara: He’s worried about our mom. About what’ll happen to her because of us.

Abby: Should he be worried?

Yara: He needs to focus on his own safety right now.

Abby: What could happen to her?

Yara: Sometimes parents are held responsible for their children’s sins. But our mom is so devout... She’ll probably be fine.

Abby: Are there options? For helping her?

Yara: He can’t convince her to leave. No one could. I’m more worried of what she’d do to him. Lev? Lev! I’m sorry!

Abby: Lev, come on out! Lev!

Yara: Lev? Lev, please come here! Lev!

Abby: Lev!

Yara: You know... I wonder if he saw this, He loves sharks.

Abby: Loves sharks but hates the ocean, huh?

Yara: He really opened up to you.

Abby: We bonded over our shared fear of dying.

Yara: He said you were brave.

Abby: He’s a liar...

Yara: I don’t know how to thank you.

Abby: You don’t need to. I did it for me.

Yara: You hear that? Lev! Are you in here?

[They find Alice. She barked from the corner. Yara is frightened.]

Abby: Hey, it’s okay. It’s okay. She just wants to play. Hey girl. Whatcha got there? She won’t hurt you. Okay, watch. (throws a squid toy) Go get it, girl.

Yara: I think she wants you to throw it again.

Abby: Okay, one more time. You wanna try?

Yara: That doesn’t seem like a good idea. She’s not going to bite, right?

Abby: Nope. I promise.

[Yara throws the toy. Alice brings it.]

Yara: (laughs) Can I do it again?

Abby: I think she would love that.

[They throw the toy a bunch of times.]

Yara: We should keep looking for him.

Yara: Lev! Why’s he doing this?

Abby: Hey, do you think that maybe he could convince your mom?

Yara: If she saw him like this, she’d strangle him with her bare hands. How much did he tell you?

Abby: Not much. I heard some of your people calling him Lily.

Yara: For a long time... I didn’t understand why he was questioning the laws... the traditions. When he explained to me how he felt inside, I told him he had to keep it to himself. I was hoping he’d snap out of it. He seemed fine for a while. But then he shaved his head like one of the men. It was suicide.

Abby: Is that when you ran?

Yara: First I screamed at him. I hit him. I was so stupid.

Abby: Hey, I have an idea. Why don’t we find something to cheer him up? C’mon. Why do you think he did it now? Shaved his head, I mean.

Yara: Last week he got assigned his role in the community. He wanted to be a soldier like me. But they decided he was to be a wife to one of the elders. It’s... tradition.

Abby: Poor kid.

Yara: (looking at a map on the wall) Where is Santa Barbara?

Abby: It’s in California.

Yara: Where’s California?

Abby: Okay, so look, uh, this is Seattle. And this is Santa Barbara.

Yara: And our island?

Abby: It’s too small to see, but it would be up here.

Yara: It’s so far.

Abby: Yeah.

Yara: Good.

Abby: There’s gotta be something left around here... Nah. (sees cheap souvenir T-shirts) We can do better than these shirts. (finds a glass ball with a walrus inside) This is cute. You see anything worthwhile?

Yara: No...

Abby: Keep looking... (finds plush shark toy) Huh. What about this?

Yara: It’s perfect. Mel’s wrong, you know. You’re a good person.

Abby: You don’t know me.

Yara: I know enough.

Owen: Abby. Will you stop stealing my stuff, please?

Abby: I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you owned everything in the aquarium.

Owen: Yeah, well, my aquarium, my stuff. I’m just kidding, you can take whatever you want. You can’t.

Yara: Have you seen Lev?

Owen: Uh, yeah. He was down that hallway. Can I... Can I talk to you?

Abby: I’ll catch up.

[Yara takes the toy and leaves.]

Owen: She couldn’t tell I was joking. I suck with kids.

Abby: Yeah.

Owen: They really like you, though. So, um, you’re coming to Santa Barbara, right?

Abby: I can’t.

Owen: Why?

Abby: You know why.

Owen: We can figure this out.

Abby: It’s too late.

Owen: No, no. It isn’t. I know... I know it’s a fucking mess. I know. But we can choose to be happy. Abby. We’re allowed to be happy.

Yara: (screams) Lev!

Abby: You hear that?

Yara: Lev! Get back here! Lev!

Mel: What’s he doing?

[The kid steals a boat and sails away.]

Yara: He’s going after her.

Owen: After who?

Abby: His mom.

Yara: She’s going to kill him, Abby.

Abby: Is the boat ready?

Owen: Not yet.

Abby: How much time do you need?

Owen: Uhh... A few hours.

Abby: Fuck. We’ll head him off. We’ll grab a boat from the marina

Mel: Hey! She just had surgery.

Yara: I’m fine.

Abby: How else am I going to find him?

Owen: I’ll go with you.

Mel: Owen!

Owen: They’re heading to the fucking island.

Mel: Exactly!

Owen: I’m not gonna let her go by herself.

Abby: Actually, you are.

Owen: I can help.

Abby: Yeah, by staying here and fixing the fucking sailboat. Get your priorities straight. Yara. Let’s go.

[Girls go to the exit.]

Abby: There’s the marina. How you doin’?

Yara: I’m good.

Abby: Okay.

Yara: Do Wolves use this place?

Abby: We dock some of our boats there.

Yara: Okay.

Abby: (walks to broken stairs) Whoa. Not making that. Here! I’ve got you.

Yara: I can do it. Let’s go.

[They jump to the ground.]

Abby: Careful. How do we get to your village in one piece?

Yara: There are blind spots along the coast we can boat into. From there we’ll follow back roads.

Abby: They’re safe?

Yara: Safest option we have.

Abby: Any chance Lev is going to change his mind?

Yara: None. He’s too stubborn.

Abby: Does he get what he’s walking into?

Yara: I thought he did... He’s got a soft spot for her.

Abby: I mean... it’s his mom.

Yara: Yeah, well. She won’t see it that way. How do we get to the marina from here?

Abby: Looks like we’ll have to go around. Down this way. Try and keep your arm dry.

Yara: Too late for that.

Abby: Dead fucking end.

Yara: Abby! Over here.

Abby: Stop. I’ve got it. ‘Kay, go, go!

Yara: There’s a way though here. C’mon.

Abby: Boats are across the water over there! We’ve just gotta get up to the road and go around!

Yara: Okay, sounds good!

Abby: Here. Stay on the dock. I’ll go get a boat and pick you up here.

Yara: No! I can help.

Abby: Not with this. I got it. Okay?

Yara: Okay.

[It overlooks the open terrain. Suddenly, someone grabs her and falls to the ground. A bullet flies over the heads.]

Manny: Get down! Abby, what the fuck?

Abby: Manny?!

Manny: You by yourself?

Abby: Yeah. Shit.

Manny: This sniper’s a fucking pro.

Abby: What are you doing out here?

Manny: The boats. We were supposed to hit the island tonight. Then this pendejo showed up. I sent a guy to call for help. Backup should be on the way. Should be.

Abby: I need one of those boats. Now.

Manny: Why?

Abby: Ask me later.

Manny: Then I guess you’re gonna help me take this guy out.

Abby: Let’s do it.

Manny: Stay low! He killed my whole fucking team!

Abby: Don’t worry, we’ll get him!

Manny: Fuck these trespassers!

Abby: What trespassers? The fuck was I thinking?

Manny: The last few days, they came out of nowhere.

Abby: This way!

Manny: ¡Sí! They’re hitting us hard!

Abby: Why?

Manny: Don’t know!

Abby: Through here! Go, go!

Manny: Abby!

Abby: It’s nothing. I’m moving up!

Manny: ¡Muévete! (Move!) Fuck... What next? Abby!

Abby: Almost got myself fucking killed! I’m moving up!

Manny: Let’s get inside of that garage!

Abby: We can use this as cover! (drags a container)

Manny: I’m right behind you! Go! The cart’s falling apart! We got to move! Go, go!

[They enter the garage.]

Abby: Fuck, he’s good!

Manny: No shit! We should be going after them instead of the goddamn island.

Abby: How is that still on?

Manny: Might be happening right now.

Abby: Shit. Manny. What the fuck is he doing?

Manny: Shit. It’s loading them to us. Get ready. (killing undead) Die! Let’s get up to the bridge! Abby! Stairs over here! ...Shit. Got you!

Abby: Oh fuck, he’s doing it again. I can’t wait to get my hands on this guy.

Manny: Abby, over here!

Abby: Oh, shit!

Manny: Go ahead, I’ll cover you.

Abby: Go.

Manny: Where’d you go?

Abby: He couldn’t have gone far.

Manny: Down!

Abby: Damn it!

Manny: Fuck it! Hey! ¡Estás pinche muerto! (You’re fucking dead!) He’s right there! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Abby: Keep the pressure up!

Manny: Shit, watch out! Get down! We got you, pendejo!

Abby: You see him?

Manny: Move up! There, there! Flank him! You’re going down, puto! Push in! Fuck!

Abby: He’s cornered!

[She tries to open the door but it’s blocked.]

Abby: Manny.

Manny: Okay.

[They try to open the door.]

Manny: Screw it, let’s just--

[In this very moment the sniper shoots Manny in the head. The bullet flies out of his eye. In the flow of adrenaline Abby smashes through the door and hides behind a table. Her face is covered in Manny’s blood. She’s shocked.]

Abby: Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

[She sneaks up on the sniper from behind and attacks him. The sniper is Tommy. They have a brief fight, after which Yara approaches and sticks a knife in Tommy’s stomach. Tommy falls from the balcony into the water.]

Yara: You all right? Abby?

Abby: Yeah. You?

Yara: Yeah. Who was that?

Abby: Shit. It doesn’t matter. Let’s get Lev and get back to the aquarium. Come on. We’ll take that boat.

[Next scene. Abby drives the boat at great speed. Her face is either sad or trying to deal with diarrhea, it’s not clear. They arrive at the island.]

Abby: Which way?

Yara: Come on.

Abby: Where is everyone? No guards?

Yara: They don’t use this corner of the island. Look! Lev’s boat. We have to catch up to him.

Abby: Do you know where he’s going?

Yara: To our house... That’s where our mom will be.

Abby: How far is it?

Yara: Across the island.

Abby: Shit. What about your people?

Yara: We’ll take back trails. They won’t see us. Are you sure the Wolves are attacking tonight?

Abby: Yeah... that’s what my friend told me. They’ll use this storm as a cover for the attack... Unless Isaac changes his mind.

Yara: Your leader, Isaac. What does he want?

Abby: An end to the fighting.

Yara: But at what cost?

Abby: At this point... Any cost.

Yara: Up here.

Abby: Are you good climbing that?

Yara: It’s the fastest way. Abby?

Abby: Grabbing supplies. Just in case.

Yara: Abby? Why are you helping us?

Abby: Lev asked me the same thing I guess... You don’t deserve this. But also... I needed to. I had to. (sees something on the other end of the island) Whoa... Is that your village?

Yara: No. That’s Haven. Ours is further inland. Don’t linger. They might see you. Oh no...

Abby: What is that?

Yara: It’s our warning signal. Your people are here. The whole island is on alert now. We need to hurry.

Abby: God damn it, Isaac...!

Yara: We’ll cut through the logging camp. Follow me.

Abby: How many people live here?

Yara: Around a thousand.

Abby: How many soldiers?

Yara: Half of us are trained in combat.

Abby: What are the other half going to do when my people get here?

Yara: Some will hide. Most will fight.

[They enter some small village with handmade wood houses.]

Yara: Okay.

Abby: Where is everyone?

Yara: Off fighting. (touches a carved statue) May her light guide us through the storm.

Abby: "When you’re lost in the darkness... look for the light."

Yara: What’s that?

Abby: Something my dad used to say.

Yara: We need to climb up there.

Seraphite: Gather any weapons you can find!

Abby: Get down!

Seraphite: Guns, bows, anything!

Seraphite: Get them to the shelter! Go!

[They see a large group of fanatics gathering in the village.]

Yara: This is bad.

Abby: How do we get through this?

Yara: The gate’ll be locked. The lumber mill. The big building on the right with the torches.

Abby: That gets us outta here?

Yara: Yeah. We can cut through it.

Abby: Perfect. Come on.

Seraphite: Close the gate! Seal off the camp!

Seraphite: May she shield our children from harm.

Seraphite: Clear your mind. This is going to be a long night. Remember: only through fear can we find our true strength.

Seraphite: I’m not ready.

Seraphite: For the sake of your kin, and your land? You will be. When the time comes.

Seraphite: Could a Wolf scout have made it past our watchtowers...?

Abby: (killing) Shh. Quiet.

Seraphite: They are getting desperate...

Seraphite: Someone should inform the Elders.

Seraphite: They’ll want proof... look around.

Abby: (killing) Shh. Shh. Shut up. (killing) Don’t try anything. (killing) Shut up. (killing) Don’t try anything. (killing) Shut it. Shh. (killing) Quiet down.

Yara: They’ve got a rifle.

Abby: (killing) Shh. Quiet.

Yara: To the left!

Seraphite: Protect the camp!

Yara: Get to the lumber mill!

Seraphite: You’ll pay for this, Yara!

Yara: I think we’re clear.

Abby: That was crazy.

Yara: We’re getting close. This way, follow me!

Abby: Holy shit.

Yara: May she protect us.

Abby: Isaac, what are you doing?

Seraphite: This day was always coming...

Yara: Get down.

Seraphite: This is a gift. They’re on our territory now. Let’s show them what they deserve.

Yara: Got that one. Get your supplies and let’s go.

Abby: Okay.

Yara: Ready?

Abby: Yeah.

Yara: Please protect him.

Yara: Our village is just on the other side of the farmlands.

Abby: Great.

Seraphite: Outsiders spotted nearby! Keep eyes on the fields and forest!

Abby: Where we going?

Yara: See that tall tower?

Abby: The Space Needle?

Yara: What?

Abby: Yeah, I see it.

Yara: Head towards it.

Seraphite: Is it true? About the number of Wolves?

Seraphite: Dozens upon dozens.

Seraphite: How did we let this happen?

Seraphite: It doesn’t matter now. Just be ready.

Seraphite: You’ll pay for this, Yara!

Yara: Got him. On the right! She’s got a shotgun!

Seraphite: You’ll pay for this, Yara!

Abby: Fuck... That was rough.

Yara: Let’s get to the village. Over here. Not that way, they’ll see us. It’s here. C’mon.

Abby: How’s the arm?

Yara: Hurts. This way.

[They find the house.]

Yara: This is the one. Abby, help me.

[Abby opens the door.]

Yara: Lev?

[Their mother lies dead on the floor.]

Yara: Mom... (sses Lev) Oh, thank god. Did she do this?

Lev: (cries) I just tried talking to her. I tried to make her understand, but she.... she just kept yelling. She started chasing me. I tried to make her stop. I was just pushing her off of me...

Yara: Hey, hey, hey.

Lev: Then she hit the table.

Yara: Listen.

Lev: Yara...

Yara: You were defending yourself. You did nothing wrong. (hugs him) It’s gonna be okay, I promise.

Lev: I want to leave.

Yara: Yeah, me too. C’mon.

Abby: (to Lev) Hey, kid.

Yara: C’mon. Here.

Lev: Yara... I never should’ve...

Yara: It’s okay. I’m glad we found you. Let’s go.

[They leave the house. It is raining outside.]

Lev: What’s happening? Wolves?

Yara: All over the island... We’ll be okay. She protects us.

Abby: Shouldn’t we head back for our boat?

Yara: No. I hear fighting back there.

Abby: I hear fighting everywhere.

Lev: There are lots of boats in Haven.

Yara: That’s what I was thinking. We can cut through Old Town... Avoid the main roads.

Abby: How far’s Haven?

Yara: Not close. But it’s our best chance. Just keep following us.

Abby: Lead the way.

Lev: Everyone’s left to fight the Wolves.

Abby: Yeah.

Lev: How’s your arm?

Yara: Arm’s fine. I’m just tired.

Lev: Yara. Mom believed with all her heart.

Yara: I know.

Lev: Then why would this happen to her?

Yara: Our faith doesn’t make us immortal. Loss is around every corner. But our faith guides us to find the strength to rise above that loss.

Lev: She guides us. That’s down the street.

[Someone fighting and dying far from the heroes.]

Yara: Get inside. Quickly.

WLF Soldier: Maggie! Is the area secure?

WLF Soldier: It better be. We just mowed down a ton of these fucks. What’s the plan?

WLF Soldier: We’re heading to the capital. Take your team and clean the villages by the farmlands. All of you, this way!

Yara: Under the door. Quickly.

Lev: We’re leaving so many people behind...

Yara: We can’t help them.

Lev: I know...

Yara: Stay close to me.

Lev: Okay.

Yara: Oh god.

Abby: We need to get off the street.

Yara: Lev. Abby. This way.

WLF Soldier: Where are we meeting up with Isaac’s group?

WLF Soldier: Over by the old radio tower. Just a little ways from here.

WLF Soldier: Any word from the capital?

WLF Soldier: Alpha’s got them on the defensive. And Bravo’s heading inland.

WLF Soldier: We caught these freaks completely off guard.

WLF Soldier: Yeah. It’ll all be over soon. Let’s move!

Abby: Can we get away from these guys?

Yara: Yeah... We’re going a different way. The alley across the street. Go. Crawl under the truck!

[Abby finds the movie theater. The same one Ellie using as a hideout.]

Lev: What do we do when we find him?

Abby: Just figure out how to get in first. Lights are on. Still with me, Lev?

Lev: Yes.

Abby: (he tries the front door - it is locked) Keep looking. Okay. Grab that ladder. Ready?

Radio: Units Alpha, Bravo, Echo, come in. Units Alpha, Bravo, Echo, please respond, over.

[They get inside the theater.]

Abby: All right. Stay quiet now.

Radio: What the hell is going on over there?

[Abby finds pictures of her friends.]

Abby: These are Leah’s. Careful... Stay close.

[He notices Tommy on the first floor. He stands with his back to her and talks to himself.]

Tommy: Fuckin’ Jesse... Think I don’t know what real gold looks like… Wait’ll you see this, you sumbitch. She gonna love it.

Abby: Hands up. Back away from your shit. I said back up!

Tommy: You’re making a big mistake--

Abby: Don’t fuckin’ turn around. Lev, keep your bow on him. Get on the ground.

Tommy: You gonna kill me like a coward?

[Abby kicks him on the knee. Tommy falls. Abby hits him on the head with the handle of her gun.]

Abby: You fucking people.

[At this moment Jesse and Ellie come out to the room. Abby kills Jesse, and Ellie hides behind the counter.]

Abby: Stand up! Hands in the air or shoot this one, too!

Tommy: Don’t you do it, Ellie! Get out of here!

Abby: Stand up now!

Tommy: Don’t you fucking dare--

Abby: (kicks Tommy) Shut the fuck up! All right--

Ellie: Stop, stop!

Abby: Toss your weapon. Toss your weapon!

Ellie: (throws her gun) Fuck!

Tommy: No... no...

Ellie: I know why you killed Joel. He did what he did to save me. There’s no cure because of me. I’m the one that you want. Just let him go.

Abby: You killed my friends... We let you both live... and you wasted it!

Ellie: Wait!

Lev: Get off of her!

[She shoots, but Tommy grabs her arm shifting the aim. They fight. Abby kills Tommy.]

Ellie: Tommy!

Abby: Come on! (to Lev) Stay here. Watch the exits, don’t let her leave. (to Ellie) Don’t you fucking run!

[She runs after Ellie and shoots at her. Ellie waits for her at the entrance to the next room and beats off the gun out of Abby’s hands with a stick. Bloody fight begins.]

Ellie: Motherfucker! You’re gonna die here! Shit--! That you?

Abby: Damn it...

Ellie: Coming for you! Fuck! Fuck!

Abby: Ahh! Shit! Fucking kidding me... The hell is she doing...? Oh shit... C’mon, Abby. Shit.

[Abby finds Ellie and gets into an open fight with her. She breaks her arm and beats her hard. Deena jumps out at Abby with a knife, but gets an arrow in the back. Abby beats her head several times on the floor and puts a knife to her throat.]

Ellie: Stop. She had nothing to do with this! She’s pregnant.

Abby: Good.

Lev: Abby! (nearly cries)

[Abby struggles with the decision and pushes Dina away. Ellie is coughing up blood while lying on the floor.]

Abby: Don’t ever let me see you again. (to Lev) Come on.

[They leave.] 

THE FARM
[Some time passes. Ellie lives on a farm far from big cities. She hears a baby crying and picks him up.]

Ellie: Abby! Hey, buddy. What’s wrong? I got you. Yeah, it’s okay. We’re good. (looks at a poster) Hey, you like these guys, huh? They got some crazy hair. (looks in the mirror) Who’s that handsome fella, huh?

[Ellie and the baby go downstairs.]

Ellie: Dina?

Dina: I’m in the kitchen!

Ellie: (shows the baby a picture) Say hello to your Auntie Talia... Hi, Auntie Talia. (trying to cheer the baby) Baahhh! Man, tough crowd. (goes outside) You want some fresh air? Ahhh...

Dina: Oh, what’s up, you little goobers?

Ellie: Hey. Thanks for doing the dishes.

Dina: You can thank me by putting on some music.

Ellie: I’ll see what I can do. (to the baby) How about some tunes? Oh, you wanna boogie, huh? All right.

[She walks to Dina and dances with her.]

Dina: Oh fuck yeah! I love this song.

Ellie: Your mom is very easy to please.

Dina: I’m with you, my bar is very low. Ooh! Look at those moves.

Ellie: These moves?

Dina: Yeah.

Ellie: Ooh, look at Mama go! Oh wow! Ooh, oh hello.

Dina: This is kinda working on me.

Ellie: (kisses her neck) You’re weird.

Dina: I’m aware. Okay. Okay! You’re distracting me.

Ellie: I know!

Dina: Okay, all right, go.

Ellie: Okay...

Dina: Oh hey... I think I left Ollie outside. You mind bringing him back in?

Ellie: Yeah, sure thing. (writes JJ on a tree near Ellie + Dina) Hey, let’s get you on here. There. Now it’s official. (approaching the fence) Careful. The bad things are out there. (picking up a toy elephant) Hey, Ollie. What are you doin’ out here? Hang on, buddy. Yeah, there we go. It’s pretty, right? Hey, you know what? I’m gonna teach you how to play guitar. When your hands are bigger. And you’re not pooping your pants all the time. It’s all right. Everybody does it. Got a lot of stories to tell you. When you’re older. Much older... I don’t even know where to begin. (sings) Potato... Potato. My little baby Potato. (whistles) My Potato, my Potato. My little buddy Potato… What a big boy. Yeah... That’s my buddy. All right, little spud. We should go check on Mama.

Dina: I’m going to go hang up the laundry! Oof, my back.

Ellie: You got that?

Dina: Yeah. I got it. Does he need his jacket?

Ellie: Nah, he’s fine.

[Ellie approaches Dina. She kisses her and dances.]

Dina: More?

Ellie: You can tell me to stop. Should I stop?

Dina: Okay. Enough. Seriously!

[Ellie walks to a little goat.]

Ellie: (to the child) You wanna pet him? Here. All right, there you go. Oh, oh, oh! Gentle, gentle, gentle. Just like that. There you go. Yeah...

Dina: Hey.

Ellie: Hey.

Dina: I’ll take him. Can you get the sheep into the barn?

Ellie: No, I got ‘im, I can do it.

Dina: Yeah?

Ellie: Yeah. I want you rested up.

Dina: Okay, here.

Ellie: Come on.

Dina: Getcha in there... Don’t stay out too long, he still needs a bath.

Ellie: Psshh, I’m like the herding master. Listen up, sheep! Your dinner awaits you in the barn! So... come on... Snowy. Barn time. Daisy. Head on in. Wow, that’s a lot of sheep. How many do you think that is? Let’s count. One... Two... Better stop ‘cause I’m getting sleepy. Ewe-gene. Hey, hey. Inside, inside. Todd. Move it or lose it. We definitely have way too many sheep. Hey, what do you say we eat some of them? Tasty snack? I got one for you. What’s the quietest animal on a farm? A shhhhhhh-eep. When you’re older, you’re going to have a deep appreciation for these jokes. Okay, one more... What do you get when you cross... an angry sheep and a mad cow? An animal that’s in a baaaa-ad moooOOOO-ood. Yeah! Mama likes that one too. Okay guys, we’ll see you tomorrow! Hey! Hey! How’d you get out? Come on, little dude.

[Ellie touches the shovel and it falls with a loud sound. She remembers the murder of Joel.]

Joel: Ahh!

Ellie: (heavily breathing) Okay. C’mon, little guy... Don’t you wanna eat...?

[Ellie teleports in her consciousness to the past. They walk along a long, almost endless corridor. Joel cries for her from afar.]

Joel: Ellie!

Ellie: No, no, no...

Joel: Help me!!

Ellie: Joel!

Joel: Ahh!!

Ellie: Please no!!

[She tries to open the door at the end of the corridor. In reality, she just sits into the corner and screams. Dina comes up to her.]

Dina: Ellie? Hey, Ellie. Look at me. It’s okay, you’re home. You’re home. Breathe. Breathe.

Ellie: I can’t, I can’t!

Dina: Okay. I’m gonna take him, okay? C’mere, bud. Shh shh shh. Shh, shh. It’s okay...

Ellie: I’m sorry. I don’t know what... I was just bringing in the...

Dina: It’s okay. There we go. Hey.

Ellie: Oh man...

Dina: It’s good. Haven’t had any excitement in a while, hmm?

Ellie: Okay.

[The scene changes. Ellie comes out from the rabbit hunt. She sees a blcak horse near the house.]

Ellie: Hey you… Who’re you here with?

[She walked to the door of her house. Dina approaches her.]

Dina: Hey. Where you been?

Ellie: Hunting. Took a little longer than I thought. Who’s here?

Dina: Uh, just come inside.

Tommy: (to the baby) Ow. Ow! That’s quite a grip you got there.

Ellie: Hey, Tommy.

Tommy: There you are.

Dina: Here, lemme take him. C’mere bud. Here.

[He gets up the chair with a broken leg.]

Tommy: I got it. Hey.

Ellie: (hugs him) Hey. It’s good to see you.

Tommy: Mmm, me too. He’s getting heavy.

Ellie: I know. He’s just a big ball of muscle. Town’s good? Maria good?

Tommy: She’s fine. We um… we’re take some time apart.

Ellie: I’m sorry.

Tommy: Nah. We talked about it a lot and uh, it’s what we both want. Okay… come sit. I got something to show you. (pulls out a map) So I’ve been putting out feelers for months now. And this new guy heard my story, told me about a woman that he traded with while he was moving through California. Described her as built like an ox, traveling with a kid with scars across his face. He said they were living along this coast in the beached sailboat. Right here. That’s got to be her.

Dina: We’re done with that, so… (to the baby) shh, shh, it’s okay.

Ellie: (to Tommy) I’m sorry.

Tommy: Well, I can’t go.

Ellie: I know.

Tommy: All right… Reckon it’s easy to forget about her when you’re sitting all comfy way out there--

Dina: Hey.

Tommy: "I’ll make her pay." That’s what you said when we got back to Jackson--

Dina: Tommy.

Tommy: What a joke.

[He leaves.]

Dina: Can you take him, please?

Ellie: (takes the baby) Yeah. I got you.

[Dina leaves the house in rage.]

Dina: Hey! What the fuck was that?

Tommy: Nothin’.

Dina: God damn it, Tommy. You know what we’ve been through--

Tommy: Save it! She made me a promise!

Dina: I don’t fucking care!

Tommy: I know you don’t, Dina. That’s your goddamn problem.

Dina: Listen to me.

Tommy: Oh yeah, I’m all fuckin’ ears.

Dina: You don’t come back here with that shit to my house ever again. Do you understand me?

[Ellie looking at Tommy’s map. Next scene. Dina sleeping with her baby. Ellie wakes up and reads her old diary and journals. It’s pretty cold at night.]

Ellie: Brr.

[She takes out Joel’s guitar and sits down to play. She remembers that evening when she first kissed Dina. She just stands at the bar. Everyone’s dancing. Jesse approaches her.]

Jesse: I hate these things.

Ellie: Tell me about it.

Jesse: Your old man really laid into me today.

Ellie: What happened?

Jesse: Another lecture about my patrols. Don’t go here. Don’t go there. Funny how involved he gets whenever you’re scheduled to go out.

Ellie: Yeah.

Jesse: She’s uh… putting on quite the show.

[Dina dances all the way.]

Ellie: I gave you guys two weeks until you are back together.

Jesse: Not gonna happen.

Ellie: She uh… say something to you?

Jesse: Make it one week.

Dina: Ellie! Hey! What took you so long?

Ellie: Well, I’m here, aren’t I?

Jesse: Dina.

Dina: Jesse. (to Ellie) C’mon.

Jesse: Hey, don’t forget we’re headin’ out early, so get some rest!

Dina: Yes, sir.

Ellie: You’re such a dick.

Dina: Come on. Don’t you start with me. Okay, I have a very serious question for you. How bad do I smell?

Ellie: (takes a sniff) Like a hot pile of garbage.

Dina: Oh! Okay. Ugh! How about that? (hugs her)

Ellie: Gross.

Dina: You love it.

Ellie: Every guy in this room is staring at you right now.

Dina: Maybe they’re staring at you.

Ellie: They’re not.

Dina: Maybe they’re jealous of you.

Ellie: I’m... just a girl. Not a threat.

Dina: (fixing Ellie’s hair) Oh, Ellie… I think they should be terrified of you.

[They kiss. Ellie smiles. Seth approaches them.]

Seth: This is a family event.

Ellie: (smiles) Sorry. Sorry!

[They are going away.]

Seth: Remember the next time there’s kids around.

Dina: Yeah, like you’re setting such a great example.

Seth: Oh, just what this town needs. Another loud-mouthed dyke.

[Ellie’s turns around. She’s full of rage.]

Ellie: What the fuck did you just say?

Dina: Ellie! Ellie, don’t!

Joel: Hey! (pushes Seth) Get the hell outta here.

Seth: Get your hands off me.

Maria: Hey! (to Joel) Enough. (to Seth) Come on, you. Let’s go for a walk.

Seth: What about them?

Seth: You worry about yourself. Let’s get you some fresh air.

[They leave the party.]

Joel: You all right, kiddo--?

Ellie: What is wrong with you?

Joel: He had no right--

Ellie: And you do? I don’t need you fucking help, Joel.

Joel: (walking away) Right.

[He leaves the party too. Ellie looks around in confusion, wondering if she did the right thing. The scene ends. Ellie stands dressed in her house and puts the shotgun in her backpack. Dina enters.]

Dina: Hey.

Ellie: Hey.

Dina: Man, it’s been a while since he slept this long, huh?

Ellie: He had a day.

Dina: Yeah. He’s fine. Come back to bed. We’ll talk about it in the morning. Okay?

Ellie: I have to finish it.

Dina: You don’t owe Tommy anything.

Ellie: I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. I’m… I’m not like you, Dina.

Dina: What? You think this is easy? For you, and for him, I deal with it.

Ellie: I love you--

Dina: Prove it. Stay.

Ellie: I can’t.

Dina: So, what? I’m just supposed to sit here and wait for you, for god knows how long, just thinking you’re fucking dead the entire time?

Ellie: I don’t plan on dying.

Dina: Yeah, well, neither did Jesse. Or Joel. Hey, stop. Hey. Hey, come on. We’ve got a family. She doesn’t get to be more important than that. No. I’m not gonna do this again.

Ellie: That’s up to you.

[Ellie leaves the house. Dina cries.]

SANTA BARBARA
[The scene changes to a long-abandoned small town. Lev and Abby walking through it.]

Lev: (reads a sign) 2425 Constance. 2425 Constance.

Abby: Okay, Constance. Now we just need...

Lev: Ugh. We checked this street a week ago. Can’t believe you traded a pistol for this.

Abby: It’s a lead.

Lev: No way that guy saw Fireflies over here.

Abby: Stop. I feel good about this.

Lev: Well, I don’t.

Abby: Come on.

Lev: 2410.

Abby: It’s not going to be on that side. It’s all evens.

Lev: Shh! Something’s out there. Clicker!

Abby: (kills it) All right... We’re good.

Lev: I don’t see any numbers.

Abby: Yeah... This has to be it. Right?

Lev: Sure.

Abby: Let’s see. (lifts the garage door) Good enough.

[They enter the house.]

Lev: This place looks abandoned... Like all the other houses.

Abby: Keep searching. (finds a telegram) Huh. 2425 Constance. This is the place.

Lev: Okay but... there’s nothing here.

Abby: We don’t know that yet.

[They walk in some kids’ room painted like a jungle.]

Lev: They painted the indoors to look like the outdoors... but plants don’t look like that...

Abby: It’s more like a child’s dream version of the outdoors. In the old world, it’d be common for them to decorate kids’ rooms like this. My dad painted a... a colorful jungle for me.

Lev: Oh... Yara would’ve loved that.

Abby: I bet she would’ve. (tries a door) Locked.

Lev: Maybe there’s another way in?

Abby: Are you being positive?

Lev: I’m trying to be helpful.

Abby: You’re always helpful. (searches the house) What about...? (sighs) Nada. Is it really nothing...? It can’t be... Lev. I think we’re done here.

Lev: No, wait. In here.

Abby: You find something?

Lev: Scratches.

Abby: Scooch.

[They push away a cabinet to reveal a secret way to the basement.]

Abby: Hello?

Lev: Been awhile since anyone’s been here.

Abby: Unfortunately, I have to agree with you. Pretty nice barracks, all things considered. They were here for a while.

Lev: That’s the shower, right?

Abby: Mm-hmm.

Abby: (turns on the power) Guess they’ve got solar.

Lev: Oh.

Abby: (finds a radio) Is this frequency currently in use? (to the mic) This is... (to Lev) Do you see a call sign anywhere?

Lev: A what?

Abby: It’s a short list of numbers and letters. Fuck it. (to the mic) This is Abby from Santa Barbara. Can anyone hear me? Standing by. Is anyone out there?

Lev: What’s this?

Abby: Those’re frequencies. (setting up the radio and using the mic) Is this frequency currently in use? This is Abby from Santa Barbara, is anyone out there?

Lev: Are these other Firefly outposts?

Abby: I don’t know. (to the mic) Can anyone hear me? Hello? Is this frequency currently in use? This is Abby from Santa Barbara. Hello. Hello! (tries different numbers) Is this frequency currently in use? Hello, this is Abby from Santa Barbara. Can anyone hear me? If anyone can hear me, please reply. Please answer.

Radio: Hi, Abby. We got a clear signal on you. Where in Santa Barbara you calling from?

Abby: Umm... 2425 Constance. Uh, we got a tip about a base, but there’s no one here. We’re looking for Fireflies. I’m a Firefly.

Radio: Where were you stationed?

Abby: I was part of the Salt Lake outpost.

Radio: Who ran that facility?

Abby: Dr. Jerry Anderson. He was my dad.

Radio: Well, how ‘bout that. We pulled everyone back from the satellite stations and brought them back here to home base.

Abby: How many of you are there?

Radio: We’re about... two hundred strong now. With a few more every month.

Abby: Owen was right. You’re about to get two more. How do we find you?

Radio: Get to Catalina Island. Approach the large domed building in Avalon. We’ll find you.

Abby: Okay... okay... We’ll see you soon. Over and out.

Radio: Looking forward to it. Good luck, Abby from Santa Barbara. Over and out.

Abby: C’mon. Let’s get back to the sailboat.

Lev: Okay, fine. You were right.

Abby: Uh... What was that?

Lev: Why do you make me repeat whenever I’m wrong?

Abby: ‘Cause it makes me feel better. And ‘cause it happens so rarely.

[Abby leaves the house and is attacked by two people. The man hits her with an iron pipe knocking out the weapon. The woman grabs her and throws her to the ground. Abby is desperately fighting off. Lev shoots the man with an arrow. At this moment, a fat man approaches Lev and smacks him in the face. Lev falls on the ground.]

Abby: Lev, no!

[Abby is grabbed, pressed to the ground and hit with a bat several times.]

Fat Man: Stop. Stop! Don’t kill her now. Tie her up. (to the man) Come here. C’mere, lemme see you. You ready?

Man: Wait, what’re you doing? (fat man breaks the arrow and pulls it out) Wait, wait-- Ahh! Fuck, man!

Fat Man: You’re fine. Get that little one.

[The man searches Lev’s pockets.]

Abby: Don’t touch him. Don’t you fucking touch him!

Fat Man: Oh shit. One hell of a catch, huh?

Ellie: Where did you go from here?

[Meanwhile, Ellie is looking at the map on the yacht.]

Ellie: 2425 Constance... Yeah, that’s gotta be it.

[She landed on the island shore.]

Ellie: How would she get up to the street from here...? This looks promising. Here we go... Okay... Now what? Mesa Bluff. I’m here, and Santa Barbara proper is... that way C’mon. Fuck. I swear to god, Abby... If these infected killed you... I gotta get out of here... Where am I? There’s gotta be a street around here. Okay... Santa Barbara’s downhill... 2425 Constance. She has to be down there…

[She makes her way into a small gap between the truck and the house and steps on the trap. Her foot hits a loop and it drags her into a tree. Ellie bumps sideways against a broken branch, loses her knife.]

Ellie: Ahh! Shit! Come on. No! No no no! Fuck! Fuck.

[She hangs on the tree upside down for many hours. Some people approaches her. ]

Ellie: Abby? Abby! I found you! I found...

Fat Man: See? We got a live one.

Man: This bitch is fucked up.

[The fat man releases Ellie. She falls on the ground.]

Ellie: Ahh! Fuck!

Man: We’ll be lucky if she lasts a month. Can we please just say we’re done for the day?

Fat Man: Yeah. Get that thing down, let’s reset the traps.

Man: Really, man? I mean, is she even worth the trip back? It’s not like-- (accidentally comes near an undead) Ahh! Fuck!

Fat Man: Man: It get you?

Man: No. No... I’m good. I’m good. Fuck. (Ellie laughs) Something funny?

Ellie: Looks like you shit your pants.

Man: The fuck you say?

Ellie: What a little bitch.

Man: Oh, you like funny, huh? Get up.

Fat Man: Come on. We don’t need this.

Man: No, man, she’s fucked up anyway, come on!

Ellie: Please don’t--!

Man: Yeah, it’s funny, right?

Fat Man: Are you serious--?

[A man drags Ellie to a tied undead.]

Man: Come on! Laugh!

[Ellie turns around and pushes the man into a undead man’s arms.]

Man: Ahh!

Fat Man: Oh shit! (Ellie shot his leg) Ahh! God damn it! Fuck! (Ellie goes to kill him) Wait! Wait! You said Abby? You’re looking for an Abby, right? We picked one up a couple of months ago.

Ellie: Yeah, sure.

Man: Big girl! Blonde! Arms like mine. She had a scrawny kid with cuts by his mouth. Yeah, that’s her. You let me go, I’ll tell you where she is. You can get to her before that infection takes over.

Ellie: Talk.

Man: She’s in a holding cell in our camp.

Ellie: Where is that?

Man: Head that way ‘til you hit the railroad track. That’ll lead you to a resort. We keep ‘em in the tall, round building. I swear.

[Ellie shot him.]

[Her wound is bleeding heavily. But it is still going forward.]

Ellie: Tracks to resort... tall round building... Tracks to resort... tall round building… Tracks to resort... tall round building... Tracks to resort... tall round building… (checks on her wound) Fuck.

[Meanwhile, someone is shooting at the camp.]

Rattler: Over here! Aim for his legs, I want him alive!

Man: I won’t go back!

Rattler: Is that a gun? He’s got a gun!

Man: I won’t go back -- !

Ellie: (hiding) Shit.

Rattler: God damn it!

Ellie: (kills them) Good. Okay... Where are the others...?

[She continues through the camp and kills all inhabitants without mercy.]

Rattler: We got a live one!

Ellie: Okay...

Rattler: Where are the others...?

Rattler: Stray!

Ellie: Big group... I better find her before these idiots kill her

Ellie: (killing) Don’t. Quiet. (killing) Shut your mouth. Just shut up.

Rattler: Runaway!

Ellie: Any others? Fuck. My side... Where are the tracks? Okay. Tracks to the resort. Shit. Oh god. That looks like a tall, round building. How do I get in there... Hello...

[She sees a man and a woman mocking on tied undead.]

Rattler: Ha ha! Come on! You can do it! Just a little closer, buddy!

Rattler: Dude, leave him alone… he can’t feel anything.

Rattler: Fuck that. I promise him I’d do this to him.

Rattler: This is such a fucked up hobby.

Rattler: Bet you wish you didn’t try and escape now, don’t ya, Anthony?

[Ellie kills him.]

Rattler: Oh my God. Secure the area. We’re not alone.

[Ellie kills them all.]

Ellie: That it? These are some sick fucks… Tall round building… There it is.

[Ellie gets close to the building.]

Ellie: (killing) Just shut up.

Rattler: Infected got loose! Shit!

[Ellie takes advantage of the moment and infiltrates the house.]

Rattler: Pete?!

Rattler: I’ll see what’s up.

Rattler: I’ll keep an eye out.

Rattler: It’s Pete! He’s fuckin’ dead!

Rattler: Someone’s out there!

Rattler: Spread out, let’s go!

Rattler: What’ve we got, guys? Fuckin’ anyone got anything?

Rattler: I don’t see anything.

Rattler: Everyone, report in.

Rattler: Don’t see anyone.

Rattler: Amber?!

Rattler: I’m on it.

Rattler: What’s yourself.

Rattler: Amber’s dead! How’d they get past us?! Jesus! Smoke! Watch it! Stray! Shit! Right over here!

[Ellie takes the guy as a hostage.]

Rattler: Let him go, asshole!

Rattler: Shit… shit… shit…

Rattler: God damn it!

Rattler: I’ll fuck you up!

Rattler: Mateo! (grabs Ellie) Got you!

[Ellie kills the girl.]

Ellie: Fuck.

Rattler: Take it down!

Rattler: Oh my God!

[Ellie’s hiding.]

Rattler: Any luck?

Rattler: Nothing over here.

Ellie: (killing) Shh.

Rattler: Over there! Thought I saw someone. Caught her! Right there!

[Ellie kills her.]

Rattler: Marta!!

Ellie: You’re fucking next! Okay.

Rattler: if you’re gonna kill me… get it over with… if you’ve got the nerve…

[Ellie pulls out her hatchet.]

Rattler: Motherfucker!

[Ellie kills her.]

Rattler: We’ve been hit!

Rattler: What happened?

Rattler: I don’t know! It’s gotta be a fucking stray!

Rattler: Shit!

Rattler: Spread out! Guard the tower!

Rattler: Think I’ve got company. I’ll check it out.

Rattler: Wes?! I’ll go see what’s up.

Rattler: Go, I’ll watch you back.

Rattler: Someone got Wes!

Rattler: Huh?

Rattler: Spread out, look around. We gotta stop this!

Rattler: (dying) Ahhh!

Rattler: Cole! Ambush! It came from over there, quick!

Rattler: What’ve we got? Anything?

Rattler: Runaway! Over here!

Rattler: Push forward!

Rattler: Stay low!

Rattler: There you are!

[Ellie kills as many as she can and then barricades herself in the other part of the building.]

Ellie: Almost there… Where are these fucking prisoners…

[The prison guard attacks Ellie. She pushes the guard to the cell and the prisoners grab her.]

Prisoner: Fucking kill her!

Prisoner: Bitch!

Prisoner: I got the keys!

Prisoner: Unlock the door!

Prisoner: Get the guns! C’mon, c’mon, c’mon! Move! Here. All right, come on let’s go.

Ellie: Hey, whoa. Where’s Abby?

Prisoner: She’s bit!

Prisoner: Keep back!

Ellie: Hey, don’t point that fucking thing at me!

Prisoner: Hey, hey, hey! Abby tried to escape. She’s down at the pillars.

Ellie: The pillars?

Prisoner: Head down to the beach. You won’t miss it. She’s probably already dead. (to the others) Come on!

[They run away.]

Ellie: Where are you… Abby. Abby. Abby, Abby…

Rattler: (from afar) They’re out! The prisoners are out! Open fire!

Rattler: (from afar) They’re armed! Fall back! Fucking run!

Rattler: (from afar) Shoot them!

Rattler: (from afar) No! Please! No!

Rattler: (from afar) Help! Somebody help!

Ellie: Fuck… Head to the beach…

[The beach is dotted with executed, that reminds of Jesus on the cross.]

Ellie: Abby!

[She finds Abby tied to a log like everyone else.]

Abby: (barely speaking) Help me. Please… It’s you.

[Ellie pulls out her knife… and cuts her loose. Abby helps her little friend.]

Abby: Lev.

Ellie: Abby.

Abby: (to Lev) I got you. I got you. (to Ellie) There are boats this way.

[They walk together in silence. Near the boat Ellie gets a flashback about Joel. She wakes to Abby.]

Ellie: I can’t let you leave.

Abby: I’m not doing this.

[Ellie throws Abby and kicks her.]

Abby: No. I’m not going to fight you.

Ellie: Yes, you will.

[She put her knife to Lev’s throat.]

Abby: He’s not part of this.

Ellie: You made him a part of this.

Abby: Okay. Okay.

[They brutally fight to the death. Blood. Tears. Broken bones. Cutted fingers. But in the end… Ellie can’t do it.]

Ellie: (cries) Go. Just take him.

[Abby gets to the boat and sails away.]

THE FARM
[Ellie gets back to her house. He slowly walks in. Dina with the baby is gone. Ellie takes her guitar and starts playing. She remembers Joel. He sits on a chair on the veranda of his house and quietly plays the guitar. Ellie comes up to him.]

Joel: Hey.

Ellie: What’re you drinking?

Joel: Coffee.

Ellie: Where’d you get that?

Joel: Uh, those people that came through last week.

Ellie: Oh.

Joel: A little embarrassed as to what I had to trade to get it, but... it’s not bad.

Ellie: I had Seth under control.

Joel: Yeah, I know.

Ellie: And you need to stop harassing Jesse about my patrols.

Joel: Okay. Dina. Is she your girlfriend?

Ellie: No! No. She-- That was just one kiss. It doesn’t mean anything. She just... I don’t know why she did that.

Joel: You do like her.

Ellie: I’m so stupid.

Joel: Look, I have no idea what that girl’s intentions are, but… I do know that she would be lucky to have you.

Ellie: You’re such an asshole!

Joel: I’m not trying to--

Ellie: I was supposed to die in that hospital. My life would’ve fucking mattered. But you took that from me.

Joel: If somehow the Lord gave me a second chance at that moment... I would do it all over again.

Ellie: Yeah... I just... I don’t think I can ever forgive you for that. But I would like to try.

Joel: I’d like that.

Ellie: Okay. I’ll see you around.

Joel: Yep.

[Ellie sits on a chair with a guitar in her hands. There are tears in her eyes. She puts her guitar by the window and leaves.]

THE END
