As far as I understand this game has no subtitles for the cutscenes and some of the dialogue, so please forgive me for any inaccuracies. Correct me in the comments if you find any.

This text was added at the request of one of my readers, Vitaly, and checked against the latest version of the game, Terminal Cut.

[Night. The thirties. The dim street, faintly lit by lampposts, is hung with symbols of the Christian faith: crosses. They are painted on the walls and hang on every window. On top of one of the buildings stand two men. They are dressed in long robes that completely conceal them.]

Hooded Man 1: Tell me again… why are we in a vampire ghetto after sunset?

Hooded Man 2: Be patient. Wait… watch.

[A young girl and a man are running down the street in terror. The girl falls and the man tries to help her as quickly as possible. He, too, is scared to death.]

Man: C’mon! C’mon!

[Suddenly something drags the man into the darkness. He shouts wildly.]

Hooded Man 2: This is the one I’ve been watching.

[The girl is left alone. At her feet comes the severed head of the man, bleeding. Bloodrayne emerges from the darkness. The blades that are attached to her hands are bloodstained. She smiles grimly. Her eyes look like those of a serial killer.]

Hooded Man 1: We have no use for a vampire in our ranks. This is a waste of time.

Hooded Man 2: Not a vampire. Half vampire. Fewer weaknesses she must defeat.

[The girl falls to her knees in front of Bloodrayne and begins to cry, covering her face with her hands. Bloodrayne prepares to strike. Suddenly the girl turns into a vampire and hits Bloodrayne in the face with her claws.]

Hooded Man 1: Hmm. Pick a dangerous place to feed. 

Hooded Man 2: She’s hunting. Looking for her father.

[Bloodrayne strikes the vampire and knocks her to the cobblestone street. She puts her arm behind her back and breaks it.]

Hooded Man 1: The Brimstone Society…

Hooded Man 2: The Brimstone Society needs her. We will extend the invitation. Time to go.

[They leave. One of the men hangs a medallion on the statue with the symbol you can see on the game logo.]

Bloodrayne: Where is he, bitch?

[The vampire responds with an eerie, incessant scream. Bloodrayne stabs her in the neck, lifts her body off the ground, and, tossing her up, chops off her head. After that, vampires start coming at her from all the windows and doors. When they approach the corpse of their kindred they find only… a grenade without a pin. Bloodrayne, who has managed to climb to the roof, watches the explosion. When she turns around, she sees a medallion left behind by the hooded man.]

Louisiana Swamps
Sanctuary
1933 - Mortton, Louisiana

[Some time later Bloodrayne and another vampire, Mynce, wander the Louisiana swamps.]

Mynce: Let’s go then!

[They move from island to island in powerful, inhuman leaps and walk along electric wires to avoid the water that destroys them. Soon they find a dilapidated house.]

Mynce: Let’s check inside. Locked. And the windows are blocked. Let’s hope they didn’t barricade the door from the inside.

[With a powerful twisting kick of both feet, she turns the door into splinters.]

Mynce: It’s blocked from the other side. But there seems to be a weak spot in the wall. Kindly make us a new door, Miss Rayne. I’d like to investigate.

[Bloodrayne, or Rayne for short, as Mynce called her, repeats her punch and destroys part of the wall.]

Mynce: Tear it apart, Rayne!

[Rayne kills the monster behind the wall. It looks infirm and decrepit and was not capable of active resistance.]

Mynce: Good girl. Watch this.

[She demonstrates the chopping-up technique on another decrepit monster.]

Rayne: Showoff. Bloodlust satisfied?

Mynce: Not bad… Shhh. There’s one. Use your Aura Sense to see it in the dark.

[Rayne notices another enemy nearby.]

Mynce: Easy prey if you want it. He’s a big meal. Look how bright his aura is. He has no idea we’re here.

Rayne: He’s not panicking or hurt… yet.

Mynce: This one’s yours. Take him down, or grab a bite to eat.

[Rayne sucks him dry.]

Mynce: Good girl.

Rayne: Where to now?

Mynce: You tell me. Use your aura sense.

[Rayne uses the ability and finds the next target.]

Mynce: Guess we’re done here. Let’s go to the church.

[They ride the boat to the church. Rayne gets bitten by mosquitoes.]

Rayne: Damn bloodsuckers.

Mynce: Careful with your relatives. 

Rayne: They should have more sense. Thanks for dragging me out here. I just love the water.

Mynce: You’re only half-vampire. A dip might hurt, but it won’t kill you.

Rayne: So does sticking a finger in my eye. Doesn’t mean I have to do it.

Mynce: No time for pleasantries. Just like your half-sister.

Rayne: I’m just confident in my abilities.

Mynce: So am I. But this is your first assignment for the Brimstone Society, so everything must go according to plan. What do we know so far?

Rayne: Fine. Newspapers claim the people of Mortton, Louisiana are turning into some type of monster. They’re calling them ‘Mutates’. Doctors think a new disease is the cause, so they’ve quarantined the area. 

Mynce: You make me proud.

Rayne: There are numerous known biological masses in town. They appear to be the ‘carriers’ of the condition. 

Mynce: And that’s where you come in. Destroy the sources of the infection. And as many of the infected townspeople as possible. The disease cannot spread beyond this village.

Rayne: Sort of a radical cure, don’t you think?

Mynce: You’ll be doing them a favor. In the final stages their brains liquify and run out their nose and ears.

Rayne: Hell of a cold.

Mynce: One of the biological masses was found at the end of this road, in a graveyard behind the church. We’ll meet up there.

[They land on the shore by the church. Nearby, rotting monsters walk through the swamp.]

Mynce: What’s that mound by the telephone pole?

[We see an almost completely decomposed corpse.]

Rayne: What is it?

Mynce: It is… was… human. Might be remains from the final stages of the disease, but there’s something not quite right about it. Let’s check inside.

[She opens the door to the church.]

Mynce: Hmmm, seems like somebody made their last stand here. Grab some guns if you want.

[Rayne follows Mynce and enters the church as well.]

Rayne: Good thing we’re not hypersensitive to holy items like some vampires.

Mynce: You should be all set. I’m going to leaf through these documents. Maybe I can find something about past outbreaks of the disease.

[They hear a long growl. Monsters begin to approach the church. Rayne picks up the weapons lying on the floor and begins to sweep the area. Then she finds Mynce by the massive wall nearby.]

Mynce: That wall stretches across the whole town. Thirty feet high. {about 9 meters}

Rayne: I can see that. So?

Mynce: From what I understood, even the earliest French settlers feared something in these swamps.

Rayne: Feared what?

Mynce: What’s this?

[She reads the sign on the wall made in English.]

Mynce: “After our dark year. In 1873 the first stone of this great Wall of Fortitude was laid. With this plaque mounted in the year 1888 of our Lord, construction is complete. May this Wall of Fortitude, with the grace of God, shield us from evil and keep us safe now and forever.”

Rayne: Seems like they built that wall for nothing.

Mynce: I’m going to see what else I can find in those books. You should take out those bio-masses. The first one’s in the graveyard. I’ll meet up with you later.

[Rayne reloads her weapons and heads to the cemetery.]

City of the Dead
[Rayne runs through the wires to the cemetery, which turns out to be partially flooded. Jumping through the crypts, she reaches the wall and finds the “bio-mass.”]

Rayne: What the? Is that the bio-mass? It’s a nest!?

[She destroys the abomination and its offspring.]

Mynce: Well done. Strange creatures, aren’t they? 

Rayne: Strange isn’t the first word that comes to mind. What are they?

Mynce: I’m not sure. But it seems they carry a disease that causes mutations in humans.

Rayne: The Mutates.

Mynce: Right, and remember those sludge mounds we’ve been finding everywhere?

Rayne: What about them?

Mynce: Humans. What’s left of them. The spider creatures regurgitate what they eat.

Rayne: Strange doesn’t even begin to cover it.

[They hear a voice coming from behind the closed door of a crypt nearby.]

Gravedigger: Hello? Hello? Is somebody d’ere?

Mynce: Open up.

Gravedigger: Are dey Maraisreq gone?

Rayne: Is what gone?

Mynce: The Maraisreq. "Swamp monster". That’s what the Creole call the creatures.

Gravedigger: Are dey gone!?

Mynce: Yes. Now open the door.

[The gravedigger opens the door and immediately realizes that he made a mistake. The vampires standing in front of him may be more dangerous than the creatures they defeated.]

Gravedigger: Mon dieu, les diables! {Oh my god, the devils! (French)}

Mynce: Nice welcome for the rescue team. Who are you?

Gravedigger: I’m Jean Sigmon. I’m dee grave digger.

Mynce: What happened here?

Gravedlager: I don’t know. I hid in ’ere when those… when those ‘tings came. Dey can’t get in wil’out dem holes.

Mynce: Jean, you stay put. This place is obviously safe. We’ll bring other survivors here.

Gravedigger: We not leaving?

Mynce: Not yet. You’ll be safe here for a while longer.

Gravedigger: Okay. Okay. Send ’dem here to Famille Termaine mausoleum and we wait.

[He closes the door.]

Mynce: If you find anyone that is healthy and alive, send them here. But don’t forget about the nests.

Rayne: Seems like they built that wall for nothing.

Mynce: Maybe. Or maybe this time around things got worse. These creatures are very insect-like. Seems every thirty years they swarm. I almost forgot. I have something for you.

[She approaches one of the monsters and throws a thin chain at it, pulls it toward her and kills it.]

Mynce: It’s essentially a harpoon. It helps with feeding and has a decent range.

Rayne: Thanks.

Mynce: I’ll protect the mausoleum. You go find those nests. I sketched out a map of approximate locations. The reports weren’t exact. So you’ll have to search the area thoroughly. Once you’re back we’ll head over that wall. There must be some type of source where all these creatures come from.

Ghetto
[Rayne begins scouring the neighborhood for nests and survivors. Most of the local houses are also partially flooded, so Rayne has to choose her route wisely. In one of the houses she finds a woman in a red dress.]

Kazi: Dat bitch Marassa. I sit me hands on her, I make her eat her magic.

Rayne: Who?

Kazi: Marassa. Fancies ’erself Marie Laveau. Voodoo priestess.

Rayne: What about her?

Kazi: She hook up wit dee old German who came were. She go out to boat graveyard and she do black magic.

Rayne: She’s responsible for this?

Kazi: Oui! She and dee German. Scary man. Evil. She said she goin’ out dere to raise the mother of dee underworld!

Rayne: Must be one attractive lady. You better get going to Famille Termine mausoleum. It’s the only safe place in town.

Kazi: I will.

[Rayne soon finds another survivor, a farmer.]

Survivor: Please don’ kill me!

Rayne: Go to the Famille Termaine mausoleum. You’ll be safe there.

Survivor: Anyt’ing you say. Just don’ kill me. Merci.

Town Hall
[As she wanders on and kills monsters, Rayne finds a warehouse with a nest inside and the city government. She wanders through the corridors and breaks the walls to find Deputy hiding in the armory. Deputy finishes the monster off.]

Deputy: Hiyah! Die you ugly son o’bitch! Oh.

Rayne: Easy with that thing. And who’d you call ugly?

Deputy: Excuse moi. (Excuse me.) I… ahhh… I didn’t mean to…

Rayne: Save it. Just go to Famille Termaine mausoleum. You’ll be safe there.

Deputy: Well I don’ t’ink so you see. I got it pretty good right here, ya. All the guns I need and…

Rayne: …and it’s only a matter of time before these things find a way in. I did. And what if your ammo runs out?

Deputy: Well… maybe you got a point, but…

Rayne: Take your gun and go. The gravedigger’s already there. It’s the safest place for now.

Deputy: Gravedigger? Jean’s alive? My brother in law? Aright, I go. Excuse my manners. Adieu mademoiselle (Goodbye miss).

Rayne: Hold on there, Mr…

Deputy: That’d be Deputy Gorham, cher (dear).

Rayne: Deputy Gorham then, how about unlocking this thing?

Deputy: Ah oui, bien sur. (Oh yes, of course.) Sorry, so sorry.

[He opens the barred door.]

Deputy: Say fin’. Well I’m off now. Later, mon cher (my dear).

[He runs away.]

The Beauregard House
[Rayne hops on the wires and walks into town. As she explores it and fights the monsters, she finds two more survivors.]

Teengirl: Daddy!

Daddy: It’s ok, mon petite (little one). Who are you?

Rayne: That doesn’t matter. Go to the Famille Termalne mausoleum as quickly as possible.

[A monster bursts into the room and kills a man…with a shotgun.]

Teengirl: Da-aaa-đy!

Rayne: Go!

[She kills the monster and goes to the elevator.]

Rayne: The battery’s dead. I need another one. Ah! A battery.

[She goes down into the basement and destroys another nest there, then gets out of the house and walks along the wires.]

Colonial Power
[Rayne finds the city’s power plant. She has to find the last remaining nest in the city.]

Rayne: As good as it gets. Is there no dry land anymore?

[She manages to destroy a nest in the basement of the power plant.]

Rayne: That’s the last of ’em. Time to head back to the graveyard and meet up with Mynce.

City of the Dead 2
[Rayne returns to the cemetery. The unsuspecting Mynce is attacked from behind by a spider monster and devours her. The other creatures sneak into the crypt and devour the remaining survivors, then leave.]

Mynce: Ahuh… ahhhhhhhhh! Arrgh!

Gravedigger: Merde. Yaaaaiiiii!

Kazi: Great Loa!

Teengirl: Aaaa aaahhhh!

[Rayne, who had been standing nearby the whole time and saw everything, sighed.]

Rayne: No one left. Dammit. Time to put an end to this. I’ll find those bastards and rip their legs off one by one.

[She kills the remaining monsters at the crypt and goes in pursuit.]

Old Town
Rayne: Look who’s scampering along. Go ahead. Lead me to your nest.

[She follows Maraisreq trying not to touch the water. Soon, though, the wires end.]

Rayne: End of the line. Hmm… what if?

[A kind of glowing blue ball appears in front of her.]

Rayne: Mother of God! What is that!? Only one way to find out.

[She hops into the boat and swims after the glowing ball.]

Queen of the Underworld
[Rayne arrives at the ship graveyard.]

Rayne: It’s enormous. What the fuck?

[She finds candles and a magic book on one of the boats.]

Rayne: A Voodoo ritual. …to awaken the “mother of the underworld”? Either she’s a smoker or someone was just here.

[The water starts gurgling…]

Rayne: Hello?

[A huge creature appears, similar to spider monsters, only much larger. The creature roars furiously.]

Rayne: Big momma.

[She fights the creature and wins.]

Rayne: Back to sleep for you. Awww… did you eat something that isn’t agreeing with your tummy? Glowing ribs?

[She finds something inside the creature that resembles a dagger. When Rayne picks it up, she can’t resist the urge and sticks it in her stomach. A short time later, the Nazis arrive.]

Wulf: I believe you have what I’m looking for. You might say I’m a collector of these things.

Rayne: Oh god… god…

Wulf: Nothing personal, although I will enjoy this greatly.

[With a sadistic grin on his face, Nazi Wulf removes the dagger from Rayne’s belly.]

Nazi Base in Argentina
Infiltration and Execution
1938 - Phoenix Hotel. Five years later.

[Night. Rayne is standing in a hotel room talking on the phone to a man.]

DarkMan: Did you get the file?

Rayne: In my hands.

DarkMan: Our sources tell us that all of these targets are in one place right now. A huge sub bay and mining facility on the coast of Argentina. We heard tumors the Nazis are closing in on a lost relic with immense powers. We need more information. We’re sending you to South America. Find out what you can about this relic and report back to us.

Rayne: How do I contact you?

DarkMan: Use the Nazi’s communications center.

Rayne: Understood.

DarkMan: One more thing: the Nazis have organized a special task force… …called the G.G.G. or Gegengeist Gruppe.

Rayne: “Anti-ghost group”?

DarkMan: Literally, yes. The G.G.G. was established to experiment in the occult. Anything that could help Hitler succeed. Their leader and founder is Jurgen Wulf. The file you have lists many G.G.G. officers and their S.S. conspirators, including Jurgen Wulf. You are to eliminate all of these targets to prevent further… supernatural ambitions. But be careful. Members of the G.G.G. have been experimentally enhanced and are particularly dangerous. Good luck. And Rayne? Watch yourself.

1938 - Somewhere on the coast of Argentina

Rayne: It’s built right into the mountain. Hard to tell how big the place really is. And there’s my invitation.

[She kills the watchman in slomo by chopping him into small pieces. After that she begins her bloody journey through the corridors of the Nazi fortress. The first one she finds is Oberst (Coronel) Braun Mekay. He and several of his subordinates offer desperate resistance, but against the immortal vampire they have no chance of survival.]

The Dock
[Rayne walks down to the submarines. An officer on one of them spots her.]

Officer: There! The intruder is at the dock. Do not allow her to escape! I’ve got something for you, little girl. What’s wrong with you? Kill her! Kill her goddammit!

[After killing the officer’s subordinates, Rayne attacks him in slomo.]

Officer: What the hell are you?

[Killed turns out to be Korvettenoberstleutnant (Naval Lt. Colonel) Nicholaus Reinhardt.]

Rayne: One down, two left in this area.

Officer: Alarm! Execute the ambush! Ready the Panzershrek. Don’t let her get up here! Jansen, Hermann! Cover the catwalk. Get me some support on the ground! Now!

[In the blink of an eye Rayne chops the Oberinspekteur (High Engineer) Stefan Gustafson to pieces.]

Rayne: Only one to go.

[A little farther along she successfully encounters another officer, the Korvettenkapitan (Naval Captain Kreigsmarine) Timitheus Tischler. Rayne leaves the docks.]

The Barracks
Rayne: I need a control turnkey for the basement. I’ll worry about that later.

Officer: What’s wrong with you? Kill her! Kill her goddammit! 

[She slices the Standartenfuhrer (Garnison Captain) Ruprecht Reiner.]

Communication Breakdown
[Rayne notices some officer coming down in an elevator, and one of his soldiers taking out a battery and running off with it.]

Rayne: He took the battery.

[She sets off in pursuit. Finding the battery, she goes downstairs and sneaks up on an unsuspecting Generalstabsinformationen (Major General of Intelligence) J. A. Cotter and sucks his blood out, after which she continues to explore her surroundings. She finds a large church and a priest dressed as a KKK. Next to him lies several corpses.]

Rayne: What’s the shovel for, Von Blut?

Priest: How—? Oh, just taking care of a collection from this morning’s service. But I might find more uses for it.

Rayne: I can think of some myself, but they have mostly to do with your backside, preacher.

Priest: You ignorant… I am a Thule High priest, not a preacher.

Rayne: Oversight on my part. Do forgive me. And tell me about the relic.

Priest: Ahhh, the relic… Atlantis… a legendary kingdom. A superior race with powers beyond our Imagination. An Aryan race. Pure of blood. Pristine. Then the kingdom was lost. The sea reclaimed it’s right. But not all is lost. The greatest Atlantean leader, Beliar, was immortal. His body scattered in pieces in the destruction of Atlantis. Finally, we have located our great leader’s skull. It is here, buried deep underground.

Rayne: I’m sure you believe that. All of it. Everybody makes mistakes.

Priest: Enough of your insolence. I will prove Aryan superiority to you.

Rayne: Ever heard of overcompensation?

[Von Blut’s altar turns… into a machine gun nest. He moves around the church shooting at Rayne.]

Priest: I will put an end to your impudent prattle.

Rayne: I don’t think so. You just won’t be around to hear it anymore.

Priest: I’m going to splatter your brains all over the walls.

Rayne: Oh, you’re all talk.

Priest: Contemptuous bitch! Return to hell, you demon!

Rayne: You’ll have to try a little harder.

[She kills the priest. Oberpriester (High Priest) Von Blut is defeated!]

Rayne: I’m still not convinced.

[She brushes the blood off her blades.]

Rayne: It will be very warm where you’re headed. Maybe there’s some paperwork on all the hogwash he’s been rattling on about. Sounds like they have their own problems. I’m done here. I need to get into the basement. An officer should have what I need.

[She approaches the machine gun nest and searches it.]

Rayne: And what do we have here: occult writings on Atlantis and Beliar. At least he was organized. Time to radio Brimstone Society.

[She leaves the church and heads for the radio station, killing soldiers along the way.]

Rayne: I should contact Brimstone and let ’em know what I found out. (via radio) Rayne to DarkMan. Come in. I found documentation on the relic. You were right. They’re up to something big.

DarkMan: (via radio) Well done. Now continue with target termination. And try to obtain the relic. We can’t let them get to it first.

Rayne: Roger.

Dark Man: (via radio) One more thing. Destroy the communications center. We can’t have them radioing for help. Good luck. Over and out.

Rayne: The armory should have some explosives.

[She finds the explosives, making her way through the crowds of Nazis, then sets them in the radio station.]

Rayne: All set… better back up.

[Explosives detonate, depriving the Nazis of the ability to call for help.]

The Barracks 2
[Rayne walks to the lab through the basement.]

Rayne: The turnkey I found should work…

Soldier: There’s the intruder!

Soldier: Open the door!

Soldier: I’m trying! It’s jammed.

[The officer leaves the warehouse in a hurry on the truck.]

Soldier: Sir! With all due respect, this is a bad—

Officer: No one asked you soldier. Drive!

[Rayne goes on the chase, killing Nazis with a machine gun. She passes through a series of checkpoints blocked by massive shutters. One of these checkpoints turns out to be empty. Only the screams of the dying can be heard in the distance.]

Rayne: Wow, that was unexpected. What… happened here…? Hello? Nazis wanna come out and play? Come on now. I promise I’ll bite.

[She begins to hear strange creepy voices repeating her last words and sort of mocking her. Rayne continues to explore the empty corridors and warehouses and finds the handle that opens the door. Next to it lie three corpses that turn into zombies and attack our vampire. She kills them and continues to pursue the officer, but now she is confronted by Nazi zombies.]

Death’s Quarters
[Rayne descends into the laboratory, which, for the most part, looks more like a military prison. The scientists have already been turned into zombies and are attacking her. Rayne finds the officer… though something got to him first. Some abomination with a long tail attacks him and gets in his mouth. The officer’s head explodes and something like it comes out instead.]

Rayne: Very attractive.

Officer: I’ll wear you like lederhosen (leather pants).

Rayne: Whatever you are, you just said the wrong words.

[She kills the officer and several of his zombie subordinates. General Major (Brigadier General) R. Wauher is killed!]

Rayne: There must be a way through.

[She falls into the water-filled basement.]

Rayne: Aaaah!

[After climbing out of the deadly water trap, Rayne hears that the Nazis nearby are also having a hard time fighting something, probably zombies.]

Rayne: I don’t know what they were storing down there, but it gunked up my guns.

[She gets on the elevator and leaves the barracks.]

Hell Hall
[Rayne notices a female Nazi officer wearing a gauze face mask. Several of her armed soldiers lead several prisoners to the paradise of a certain mine.]

Native2: No! No! No! Please! Anything but this! Have mercy! I beg you!

[Nazi officer tosses him into the abyss. Her soldiers finish off the rest.]

Native2: Ak!

Native: Aarrgh!

Nazi Officer: (laughs)

Rayne: That big blond bitch is one of my targets. I wish I could get to her now.

[She’s about to go to the roof, but the hungry monsters - the same abominations with the long tails - burst through the door.]

Rayne: Not good.

[She escapes and barricades the passage with several boxes, one of which says Schicken an O.M. Murray (Send to O.M. Murray)]

Rayne: This is not going to hold. Time to run!

[The monsters do break in. Rayne escapes! Running through the corridors, she stumbles upon a portrait of Wulf…]

Rayne: I know that face…

[The corridor turns into a real death trap. Zombie soldiers infested with parasites have set up a makeshift firing point out of barrels and are firing on the corridor en masse.]

Rayne: As if it wasn’t bad enough.

[She finds a way around it.]

Rayne: Time to deal with that machine gunner.

[She blows up the fuel barrels by getting close to the machine gunners from behind, then gets into the elevator.]

The Laboratory
Daemite: Breathe! Breathe!

[The room fills with poisonous gas. Though not lethal, the gas slowly kills Rayne. With a few shots she shatters the glass.]

Rayne: (coughs) Asshole. Time to get out of here.

Butcheress: (via loudspeaker) Kommando, Hauptmann Eckstein, rendezvous on the roof! Our transport will be arriving shortly. Repeat: meet on the roof immediately.

[Rayne finds cisterns with the same nasty tailed monsters she’s had to fight lately. Looks like the Nazis created them!]

Rayne: Holy shit. What are they doing down here?

[She encounters a group of Nazis led by an officer in a protective suit. They retreat and Rayne follows them. After a while she catches up with the group in one of the basements of the laboratory.]

Rayne: You must be the mysterious “Kommando”. I’m sorry. Was I talking too fast? Can’t keep the words apart? I’ll talk slower. Read my lips: you’re dead. Any last words?

[She kills Generalstabsinformationen (Infantry Colonel) (Name unknown), a.k.a. ’Kommando’ and his subordinates.]

Rayne: Hmmm Kommando’s sure to have a control turnkey. Kommando’s turnkey should do the trick.

[Using the key, she lifts the massive blinds and walks on, but gets trapped.]

Officer: I got you now, bitch! Prepare for a painful death.

Rayne: Sure. I’m ready. Just tell me one thing. What the hell were you guys thinking when you made those things downstairs?

Officer: Well, you can’t say that I don’t have a heart. We didn’t make them. We woke them up when we searched for the skull of Beliar. The Butcher—I mean the Doctor, took a special interest in them. But everything went wrong. We can’t control them. But this is inconsequential to you. Aufwiedersehen fraulein. (Goodbye miss.)

[She breaks the glass, letting lethal gas into the officer’s room.]

Rayne: After you.

[Major P. Eckstein has been killed! We switch to another part of the building where a female officer, aka Butcheress, is located. She hears a knock on the door and opens the flap, in which she sees Eckstein’s face.]

Butcheress: Eckstein, finally! Where’s Kommando?

[She opens the door and it turns out that her coworker’s head has been put on Rayne’s blade.]

Rayne: Eckstein won’t be answering any questions, "Butcheress."

Butcheress: We have something in common, you and I. I am a direct descendant of Erzsébet Bathory. You know the name?

Rayne: The "Blood Countess".

Butcheress: I had a feeling you’d recognize the name. You should appreciate the lust for blood.

Rayne: I don’t appreciate senseless killing. You’re a monster, like those creatures down below.

Butcheress: The natives call them "Daemites."

Soldier: No, please doctor, not me! Neeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnn!

[Butcheress opens the flap and the soldier falls down where something eats him up.]

Butcheress: This is fascinating. First they squeeze their soft bodies into the mouth. They secrete digestive enzymes from their skin to eat the brain. The tail is inserted, rather forcefully, into the spinal column, tapping directly into the host’s nervous system. They control the host body like a puppel, seeking extremes of pleasure and pain. Mostly the easier sensation wins out: pain. They also reproduce asexually in the chest cavity. Quite remarkable, really.

Rayne: If you say so. What are you going to do with them?

Butcheress: Let me see. I could keep them here and feed them with my men, or I could unleash them on your country. Tough choice. Watch your step!

[They have a battle, near which Rayne kicks Butcheress into the same pit where she threw the soldier. Totenkopfverbandefuhrer (Death Head Leader) Dr. Bathory Mengele aka. ’The Butcheress’ is killed!]

Rayne: You know, you’re right. Fascinating creatures. I could watch them for hours. I need to find that relic and destroy these "Daemites". "Feuer" …fire. Nazis can be so helpful.

[She turns off the burners.]

Rayne: That’s more like it.

[She jumps into a pit full of corpses and ends up in a Nazi meatgrinding plant.]

The Mill Mile 
[In one of the corridors, Rayne notices several Nazis fighting a monster made up of several bodies that has breached the wall.]

Rayne: Aww, now what the hell is that!?

[She kills the Nazis and blows up the monster with grenades. After walking a little further, she finds an elevator.]

Rayne: This way to the mine.

Deep
[Down below, the Nazis are desperately fighting the tailed monsters.]

Soldier: Set the charge! Seal the tunnel!

Soldier: What do you think I’m doing here?!

MineOfficer: Clear!

Soldier: Lieutenant Strosczek and his men are still back there!

MineOfficer: They’re gone, soldier.

[The explosion blocks the passage, leaving some of the Nazis to die under the onslaught of tailed monsters. Rayne follows the officer.]

MineOfficer: Oh no! It’s her! Fall back and regroup!

[He and a few of his soldiers run away.]

Rayne: It’s me alright. Keep running. While you can. The tunnel is sealed. I need explosives and a detonator to blast my way through. Got the detonator. Now where would a girl find some demolition charges? Just what the doctor ordered for blacked passageways. All set… better back up. They sealed this tunnel too. I need to clear it. Got it. Now I just need some more demolition charges.

[In the depths of the mines, she meets an old acquaintance who is infected by the tailed abdomination.]

Rayne: Kommando. Long time no see. I love what you’ve done with yourself. You look fabulous. I guess I didn’t kill you enough the first time. I won’t make that mistake again.

Kommando: I’ll wear you like lederhosen (leather pants).

Rayne: Cute. That’s the first thing you’ve ever said to me, and I’ve heard it all
before. You need a better come on. This time, without a doubt one of us will die.

[She kills Kommando… again.]

Rayne: Kommando’s turnkey should do the trick. Great. Demolition charges. All set… better back up.

The Temple
[Now it’s up to Rayne to find her way to the temple. She travels through strange mushroom-like tunnels where only her incredible dexterity will save her from death.]

Temple Guardians
[At the very bottom of the tunnels, Rayne finds some kind of heart. She jumps inside and sees a glowing skull.]

Rayne: Beliar’s crystal skull! That’s what all the fuss is about? A chunk of glass? Ahhhh! The skull just holds the real relic: the eye.

[She takes the skull in her hands and a sharp pain pierces her. After a while she comes to her senses.]

Rayne: Whoa… ugh, I…I feel…

[Rayne gains the ability to see through walls! She notices something approaching. The Nazis have already reached the "heart" with the drilling machine.]

Rayne: Beliar’s Eye is… it’s in my head!

Soldier: Kruger! Maier! Load that thing with explosives and blow it all to hell! Hurry! Hurry! Load it up! More explosives! We need more!

Soldier: Oh God, oh God!

Soldier: We don’t have time!

[Everything starts to explode! Rayne kills the Nazis and escapes from the tunnel!]

Dante’s Inferno
Rayne: Up! Better get up!

Soldier: What’s that noise?

Soldier: It’s coming from the mineshaft.

Soldier: Get the hell out of here! Shnell, mach, schnell! (Do it, quickly!)

[The tunnel explodes.]

Walls of Jericho
[On his way out of the mines, Rayne meets a burly, muscular Nazi with some technical tweaks.]

Rayne: My, you’re a big one. Mauler, I presume?

Mauler: GegenGruppenFuhrer Wulf said you might come this way,

Rayne: He’s given up on the relic?

Mauler: What you have is not the only relic. Foolish little girl. You know nothing. Just like that stupid priest. He knows nothing but lies. Do you know which relic Wulf is unearthing in castle Gaustadt right now? Beliar’s black seething heart. The key to ruling the world is in our own country, and Wulf will control it.

Rayne: Yeah, we’ll see about that.

[She fights and defeats the big guy.]

Mauler: I can’t be beat that easily.

[He falls to the floor and dies.]

Rayne: And wrong again.

[Infanterie-kommandeur (Infantry Brigadier General) D. Mauler is defeated! Rayne walks out to the subs and notices the Wulf on one of them.]

Rayne: There you are. Payback time.

[Wulf’s submarine is sailing away.]

Rayne: That other sub’s my only chance. I’ve gotta sneak aboard.

Soldier: Christ! What happened?

Soldier: Let’s get the hell out of here. Go get the others. We’ll finish loading the crates. Now! Hurry!

Soldier: Yes sir! Right away sir!

Castle Gaustadt
Emden U-Boat Station
1938 - Emden U-Boat Shipyard, Germany

[The submarine with Rayne on board arrives in port.]

Soldier: Mein Gott! Sir! Everyone’s dead!

Soldier: Order from G.G.G. Oberscharfuhrer. Unload the crates.

Soldier: Yes sir!

Rayne: How did this…?! “In the preliminary G.G.G. headquarters at Falkenburg a Nazi officer has your next target list… …terminate him and obtain the file.”

[Rayne sneaks into the Nazi headquarters under the cover of night. It is pouring with a thunderstorm outside and she takes advantage of this to quietly break a window and get inside. A young girl walks up to the Nazi officer reading a newspaper and touches his face and leaves. In the hallway, Rayne kills her and enters the room also touching the Nazi. He relaxes and Rayne cuts off his ear. He starts crawling on the floor and yelling something in German. Rayne jumps up on a chair and licks his blood-soaked hand. Soldiers run in, whom she quickly kills.]

Rayne: (to the Nazi officer) You scared?

[To the scream of the Nazi, Rayne bites his throat.]

Red Summit
[Rayne approaches a snow-covered castle in the mountains. This massive structure is well fortified and guarded by the Nazis.]

Rayne: Castle Gaustadt. A place where nightmares are born. Vampires have called this place home for centuries. But now the Germans have put up an eviction notice. They’ve made some progress, but the creatures they’re up against are monsters even amongst vampires. An ancient breed of vampire, cut off from the world, where in isolation, they evolved into perfect killers. Daylight is fading fast. And with it any advantage the Nazis might have had. I have a new target list from the Brimstone Society. And an official objective to stop Wulf. Wulf already has Beliar’s teeth, ribs, a hand, and an eye. Now he’s after the black heart, hidden somewhere in this castle. He wants to wake Beliar in himself. Beliar. A demon. A devil. Maybe even the devil. Wulf can’t control this kind of power. If Beliar is woken, we’re all in big trouble. Wulf. Remember, five years ago in Louisiana? You almost killed me. I intend to pay you back… …with interest.

[A truck pulls up to the checkpoint.]

Guard: Papers. Let me see your papers. Danke. Drive through.

[Rayne jumps out of the truck and pulls out her guns.]

Rayne: Thanks for the ride, fucko.

[She fights her way into the castle, killing Generaloberst (Coronel) Heinrich Eberhard and Assistenzinfanterie (2nd Lieutenant of Infantry) D. Von Haber.]

Rayne: Nope, not done here.

[She also kills Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Andreas Zahl. A Nazi officer opens the door.]

Officer: Jesus Christ, what is going on!? Be ready for anything, men!

[Rayne goes to him.]

Old Gaustadt
[The soldiers are attacked by several werewolf-like monsters.]

Officer: Vampire! Hit him!

[The muscular werewolf grabs the officer and runs off with him.]

Officer: Somebody had me! Christ! Aaah! 

Rayne: Hey! That’s my target!

[She kills werewolves and Nazis and escapes in pursuit. Rayne finds a radio station and kills Leutnant (2nd Lieutenant) G. Saxon.]

Radio Voice: Mobile armor securing cathedral. Opening secondary upper entrance. Mobilize foot units and prepare infantry support. Repeat. Secondary upper entrance is open. Mobilize and enter.

Rayne: I hear you. I’ll be there in a minute.

Unholy Mecha
[There is a real war against werewolves in the castle. The Nazis are even using combat robots.]

Rayne: Oh yeah. What are those? I want one.

[She throws the pilot out of the cockpit and boards herself. Fighting her way in, she soon finds a group of robots.]

Mobile Armor Officer: (via radio) Hold your positions, men. You just patrol according to plan. Do you copy Perkins?

Perkins: (via radio) I copy.

[Rayne bursts into the room and attacks the Nazis. During the firefight some dialogues are heard, but it is very difficult to make them out because of the loud gunshots. After the victory…]

Rayne: Just you and me, Gosler.

Mobile Armor Officer: Who are you? How do you know my name?

Rayne: I’ve got a shopping list. And we fresh ran out of Gosler. The others were just for fun.

[She fights Gosler and defeats him.]

Mobile Armor Officer: Don’t kill me. I’ll give you what you want. You want the plans for our mobile armor? Anything. Just name it!

Rayne: Good. Here it is: you listening?

Mobile Armor Officer: Yes, I am listening.

Rayne: I want you dead.

[She blows up his robot. Generalstabsuberpanzer (Super Tank Lieutenant Gen.) G. Gosier is killed!]

Radio Voice: Leutnant Grueber to Generalstabsuberpanzer Gosler: bridge to the second castle has been breached. The lift at the top of the cathedral has been activated. Jetpack troops mobilize! Exercise extreme caution!

[The room is filled with soldiers with jetpacks. Like flies, they annoy Rayne.]

Rayne: I wish I could take that thing with me. But it’s too cumbersome for where I’m going.

[She continues her bloody journey. Climbing to the top of the cathedral, Rayne notices something interesting from the top of the cathedral…]

Rayne: What! Mynce is… alive? …and she’s working for that bastard Wulf? No, no, no! That bitch. I’m going to tear her apart.

[She finds a way to get to Mynce.]

Rayne: I thought you were dead.

Mynce: Thinking never was your strong point.

Rayne: You traitorous bitch!

Mynce: That really hurt. Are you here to talk or do something about it?

Rayne: Why are you doing this?

Mynce: Come on little girl. Let’s see what you’ve got.

They fight in an epic battle. Realizing she’s losing, Mynce runs away. Rayne catches up with her friend on the balcony.]

Mynce: Now we play for keeps.

Rayne: Don’t make me do this.

[With a few stikes she finishes what she started, and with a kick she throws the corpse into the abyss.]

Rayne: It’s finished.

[However, Mynce manages to get his hooks into the wall!]

Rayne: Mynce!

Mynce: Ungh… goodbye, Rayne.

[The wall collapses and Mynce finally falls into the abyss.]

Mynce: Aaaaaaaahhhh!

[Oberscharfuhrer (High Commander) (Name unknown) destroyed!]

Nightfall
[Rayne runs through the corridors of the castle. She is attacked by werewolves from time to time, but she wastes no time in fighting them, only occasionally inflicting a few cuts to keep them out of the way. Rayne reaches the room with a lever and pulls on it to open the hatch. Shouting and gunfire can be heard in the distance.]

Rayne: Hi, sweetie.

Officer: Oh God! Aaaaaaarrrgeghhhhh! Get away! Christ! Go away! Leave me alone!

[Rayne catches up and kills the Nazi. Hauptsturmführer (General Officer) C. Reichard is killed! Rayne descends below and enters the lower levels of the fortress. She sees the officer fighting a strange werewolf with a piercing on his face. The arm of this strange werewolf is a flower with a toothy mouth in the center.]

Hedrox: Hedrox wants the secret.

[He grabs the Nazi officer with his strange hand. After sucking everything out and killing the officer, Hedrox escapes by breaking through the wall.]

Rayne: My target from the stables. I guess I can check you off the list.

[Obersturmbannführer (Lieutenant-Col.) Hans Eldrich, Karstjager Gruppe is killed! The sirens go on, just like in Silent Hill. Soldiers leave this part of the castle and regroup.]

Courtyard
[Rayne continues his bloody journey in pursuit of Hedrox, killing Nazis and werewolves along the way.]

The Windmill
[Rayne catches up with Hedrox at the mill. There it turns out that it’s not just one monster… but three.]

Rayne: Hedrox.

Hedrox: Hello, Rayne. (the others hissing) Hello.

Rayne: Long way from home, Hedrox. What’s the score?

Hedrox: The relic.

Hedrox: Relic.

Hedrox: We want the heart.

Hedrox: We want…

Hedrox: …Beliar’s heart.

Hedrox: Hedrox thought the previous owner, Count Voicu… …hid the relic.

Hedrox: Hedrox found Voicu here…

Hedrox: …and threw him to his death. You saw Hedrox eat the human’s mind… …and Hedrox learned Voicu wore the relic on his crown…

Hedrox: (hissing) …the whole time.

Hedrox: Relics.

Hedrox: Relics not unlike the one in you, Rayne. Hedrox wants the secret.

Hedrox: Tell Hedrox, how does Hedrox put the relic in the body?

Rayne: Sure. You have to cut your heart out and replace it with Beliar’s.

Hedrox: He he he. Rayne amuses Hedrox.

Hedrox: Rayne.

Hedrox: Do you not think Hedrox has tried?

Hedrox: Does Rayne forget?

Hedrox: Hedrox is INFINITE. Hedrox wants the secret!

Hedrox: Hedrox will tear Rayne’s eye out…

Hedrox: …and eat her mind.

Hedrox: Eat… …to find it.

Rayne: Uh huh. Hedrox, I’m going to do the same thing to you that you did to Voicu.

[She fights the monsters and kills one of them.]

Hedrox: You understand the word “infinite,” Rayne? We are infinite.

Hedros: Infinite…

Hedrox: Keep cutting.

Hedrox: Cut us. Cut us and meet more of us.

Hedrox: We are infinite.

Hedrox: Infinite…

[However, instead of fighting them, Rayne breaks the mounts and collapses the floor. The small amount of water below is enough to kill most of the Hedrox copies.]

Rayne: know why I love you? Cause you’re smart. Ah, but there’s lots more where you came from, right? You wanna call ‘em? Or how ’bout you cut some more of yourself right now? One, two, twenty, a thousand. You always equal zero to me, Hedrox. I will kill you over and over until there are none of you left.

Hedrox: Hedrox doesn’t need Rayne. Hedrox will change someone else’s mind…

[He runs away breaking through the wall… Rayne follows him.]

The Bridge
[Standing in the distance and smoking, a soldier notices Rayne.]

Soldier: Vampire!

[He backs up and explodes on the mine.]

Rayne: Ugh, land mines.

[Rayne has to cross a minefield. At its other end she finds a bridge and, crossing it, meets an old acquaintance smoking peacefully on the other side.]

Rayne: Hello Jurgen.

[She notices her and, spewing out a stream of flame, begins to run very fast and pushes Rayne away as he approaches her. He detonates the charges set up on the bridge.]

Rayne: What the fuck?

[She flees, escaping explosions, collapsing bridge, and Nazi bullets.]

Rayne: Why didn’t Wulf kill me when he had the chance?

[She kills an officer along the way, Generalleutnant (Major General) D. Traugott and enters the building on the opposite side.]

Doppelganger
[There is a battle raging in the building. The Nazis are fighting the werewolves. Walking a little further, she enters a room with two Nazis dressed in cream-colored uniforms with red cloaks behind their backs.]

Rayne: The “Doppelganger Twins”. What a pleasant surprise. Such handsome Nazis. And two of them!

Sigmund: We had no idea the troublemaker…

Simon: …would be as beautiful as you are.

Rayne: And gentlemanly. My luck is turning.

Sigmund: What is your name, Fraulein (Miss)?

Rayne! Why bother with names? This won’t be more than a one night stand.

Sigmund: Ah… that is too bad.

Simon: A shame really. We were hoping for…

Sigmund: …something more of a commitment.

Rayne: You know, you two remind me of someone.

Sigmund: Someone you’re fond of?

Rayne: Wouldn’t so that far. Just someone I killed… again and again.

Sigmund: Ha ha ha!

Simon: She speaks of Hedrox.

Rayne: So, you boys lose your arms playing catch?

Simon: No, we were born conjoined…

Sigmund: …but sadly, separated soon after birth.

Rayne: Well when I’m done, you’ll be both be missing more than an arm.

Simon: We don’t miss an arm…

Sigmund: …we miss the connection we once had.

Rayne: You boys are too much. Now this might hurt a little.

[She engages in a battle with the nimble and quick Nazis.]

Sigmund: You should stop this nonsense…

Simon: …and join us.

Rayne: Are you talking about what I think you’re talking about?

Sigmund: Isn’t she…

Simon …wonderful brother?

Sigmund: My thoughts exactly. She’s feisty…

Simon: …and limber.

[Rayne manages to inflict several wounds on one of the brothers.]

Sigmund: Wonderful move, little girl.

Rayne: What the fuck?

Simon: Oh look! We surprised her, brother.

Sigmund: What a becoming look on her face.

Simon: Oh tell her Sigmund. She should know.

Sigmund: As with everything else, we share the other’s pain.

Simon: One of us is unaffected, while the other suffers.

Rayne: So you punch yourself when you’re mad at your brother?

Simon: Ha ha ha. She’s so quick. We should keep her.

Sigmund: We really hate to have to hurt you pretty girl.

[The battle continues. Rayne manages to mortally wound Sigmund.]

Simon: Sigmund! I will not fight you anymore. My brother has been mortally wounded. I will follow soon.

Sigmund: She’s better than us, brother.

Simon: Yes. I know.

Sigmund: She is pretty, is she not?

Simon: She is.

Sigmund: She never told me…

Simon: My brother would like to know your name.

Rayne: It’s… Rayne.

Sigmund: Pretty…

[He dies.]

Simon: Sigmund. My… brother. Goodbye… Rayne.

[Simon dies, along with his brother. Wehrmachtbeteishaber (Senior Armed Forces Commanders) Simon/Sigmund Koeger are defeated! Afterwards, the circular roof of the room explodes and someone throws Rayne down a rope ladder.]

Rayne: Who could that be?

[She climbs up.]

Rayne: Mynce!?

Mynce: Hello Rayne.

Rayne: You know, your whole coming back from the dead act is really starting to get old, Mynce.

Mynce: Rayne. I’m a double agent - ever since that mission in Louisiana.

Rayne: You expect me to swallow that?

Mynce: Yes I do. Who do you think saved you after Wulf left you for dead in Louisiana? Who do you think led you to the target file in Germany? Who do you think has been your informant this entire time?

Rayne: I… but…

Mynce: Here!

Rayne: Officer nameplates.

Mynce: You can check them off your list. Maybe now you believe me.

[Rayne crosses a few names off her list…]

Rayne: So why haven’t you killed Wulf yet?

Mynce: It’s not that easy. He’s almost invincible with all the relies in his body. But we can’t let him get Beliar’s heart. It’s the most dangerous piece.

Rayne: Hedrox already has it—

Mynce: What!?

Rayne: I don’t think he knows how to use it though. He’s looking for officers to "interrogate".

Mynce: I thought the relic was automatic.

Rayne: I did too. But nothing happened.

Mynce: We need to get that thing away from him and Wulf. The heart can awaken the demon himself and we can’t let that happen.

[They walk down the corridor, but suddenly an iron gate separates them. Wulf approaches Mynce and rips out her heart.]

Mynce: Aargh!

Rayne: Mynce!

Wulf: No one crosses me, ever. Especially not a bastard vampire. I am Jurgen Wulf. And I will soon hold the heart of Beliar and become Immortal. I will be God.

Rayne: You bastard!

Wulf: Such hatred. Such fear.

Rayne: I’m going to make you pay for this. You hear me? You’ll pay for this!

Wulf: Yes! Let the rage burn, Rayne. Feed it.

Rayne: Go to hell!

Wulf: Why do you think I haven’t killed you yet?

Rayne: That’s gonna be your biggest mistake you son of a bitch!

Wulf: Hedrox waits in the cathedral. You will join us? You both have something I want.

Rayne: I’ll kill you, Wulf! Do you hear me? I’ll pull you to pieces!

[While Rayne breaks down the gate Wulf leaves.]

Rayne: Mynce! Oh, Jesus. Mynce. You aren’t coming back this time, are you? I’ll make him pay. I promise. Today, Jurgen Wulа will die.

Of Wulfs and Demons
[Rayne runs after Wulf in a rage!]

Wulf: Give me the heart, Hedrox!

Hedrox: No.

Hedrox: Mine.

[Rayne comes running to them.]

Hedrox: So glad all are here.

Hedrox: So glad…

Hedrox: …you brought Beliar’s parts. Hedrox now knows the secret.

Hedrox: Here’s a present for your collection, Rayne.

Rayne: Oberleutnant Bogue.

[She crosses him off the list.]

Hedrox: He guessed the answer for Hedrox.

Hedrox: Tasty.

Hedrox: The secret!

Hedrox: The relic is hidden within.

Hedrox: Secret.

Hedrox: The secret.

Hedrox: Beliar’s black heart.

Hedrox: It is powerful…

Hedrox: Ah! I can feel it.

[An explosion occurs. Several Hedrox die and turn into a walking bone statue with pieces of meat and scraps of flesh.]

Hedrox: What have you done with Hedrox?

Hedrox: Where?

Beliar: There is no more Hedrox. BELIAR IS BORN! Again. Now… each of you has something that belongs to me.

Rayne: You’re going to have to come and get it.

Rayne: That was for Mynce.

Wulf: Pathetic. Doesn’t your dead friend deserve a bit more than that?

Rayne: Oh, I’m not done yet.

[She chops Wulf into small pieces and takes his eye. Showing her middle finger to the dead Nazi, she kills Beliar. The dying demon creates a powerful current of air. Rayne has to hold on to the pillar to keep from flying away. After the demon dies, she adjusts her bra and gives him the middle finger as well. She goes to pick up Beliar’s heart, however… it turns to stone. Rayne sighs and kicks it into the gutter (or whatever it is) grate and leaves. All the Nazi officers in her list are killed. Her work is done.]

Hooded Man 1: (offscreen) Beliar’s finished… You’ve earned rest, Rayne. But a new evil grows more powerful even now… The Brimstone Society is found your father. He must be stopped.

THE END
