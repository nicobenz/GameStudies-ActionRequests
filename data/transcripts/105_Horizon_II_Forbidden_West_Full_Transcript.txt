[Before the game itself begins, we hear Sylens' voice-over, against the shots of the wilderness of the Horizon world filled with beast-like machines.]

Sylens: Through a lifetime spent in the pursuit of knowledge, one question consumed me: How did our world come to be? The Old Ones perished a thousand years ago… …triggering the extinction of all life. She showed me how it was reborn. A little outcast girl, ignorant of her own importance. Through her, I learned that life was only saved through a technological miracle… …ZERO DAWN: a terraforming system composed of nine subordinate functions… …each playing its path to reshape Earth from a barter rock… …to a lush landscape… tended and protected by the machines. And with her, I learned the deepest secret of them all: the secret of her birth. That she is a clone of ELISABET SOBECK, Zero Dawn's creator… born to prevent a new extinction, driven by HADES - a malevolent AI… …given sentience by a MYSTERIOUS SIGNAL of unknown origin. And with a little help from me… …she prevailed in a great battle at the city of Meridian… …becoming a champion for all humankind. But as useful as she has been, now I must leave her behind. For as she strives to put right what HADES sundered… I have made a new discovery… One that heralds both destruction and opportunity.

[Sylens walks towards the Grave-Hoard as we have seen in the end of the first game.]



[A fox is running through the woods, followed by three Watchers. Thunderjaw roams the mountains, growling furiously. A herd of Grazer runs in the steppes, and Tallneck and some Trampler walk leisurely in the opposite direction. Our heroine, Aloy, is riding her Charger somewhere.]

Aloy: (offscreen) I'm running out of time, Elisabet. The land is dying. People are suffering. Soon, they'll starve. All because of a terraforming system that's spiraling out of control.

[She sees a few tillers gathering a meager harvest and speeds off.]

Aloy: And only I… Only I have your genetic code. It won't be long before we hit the point of no return. And then… Extinction. I've been searching for months for what I need. A backup of GAIA, the AI you designed to control the system. But every time I think I have a lead, it comes to nothing. And every night I have the same dream. I'm walking under a brilliant night sky, through a field of flowers. And when I arrive at the center… I see you, Elisabet. Waiting for me. Even though you've been dead for a thousand years. You're the closest person I've ever had to a mother. 

[Elisabet puts a pendant around Aloy's neck and puts her hand on Aloy’s fatty cheek.]

Aloy: And for a moment, I feel whole. 

[She hugs Elisabet.]

Aloy: But it never lasts. 

[The wind carries Elisabet away. A vicious liana yanks itself to Aloy's leg and wraps itself around her leg. Aloy wakes up.]

Aloy: I’m always left alone. 

[She pulls out a small purse and takes out the pendant.]

Aloy: This world is your legacy, Elisabet. I won't let it slip away. The valley below is my only remaining lead. My last hope to find the backup. I'll do whatever it takes to get it. I promise.

[She puts the pendant on and is about to walk forward when suddenly she notices someone. She lazily takes out her bow and draws her bowstring but sees that it is Varl.]

Aloy: Varl?! 

Varl: If it isn't Aloy, the Savior of Meridian, Anointed of the Nora! 

Aloy: You know I hate being called that stuff. 

Varl: Well consider it a punishment for running out on us on the very same night we beat HADES. 

Aloy: I grew up an outcast, remember? I'm not much for parties. 

Varl: Yeah, but that one was in your honor. Just saying. So. What are we doing? It must be urgent since you left so fast. Delving into ancient ruins? Or maybe it has something to do with the blight?

Aloy: Both, actually. But should--

Varl: Oh, no. I've been tracking you a long way. It's okay. After everything you've done to help the Nora - and my family - I swore an oath to help you, no matter what. You're stuck with me now - Like bark on wood.

Aloy: Okay. But if you're going to come with me, you'll need to be able to see what I see.

[She throws him a triangle shaped device.]

Varl: A Focus. Never thought I'd get your "second sight".

Aloy: I give you another one later and show you how to back up your data.

Varl: "Data"?

Aloy: Information on the device. We've got a lot to cover. I'll have to explain everything as we go.

[Varl puts the device on and sees different data in front of his eyes. It surprises him, but he doesn't look shocked.]

Varl: You see like this all the time?

Aloy: Since I was a little girl. Come on.

[They come to the edge of the cliff.]

Aloy: Shall we?

[They slide down like sacks of potatoes.]

Aloy: All right. I got a couple of scrapes on the way here. We should find some medicinal plants, stock up. So it's time for your first lesson with the Focus.

Varl: Sounds good. Let's get started.

REACH FOR THE STARS
Varl: These plants don't look like the ones in the Sacred Lands.

Aloy: The Focus helps you see the ones we need. Blech.

Varl: Bitter?

Aloy: Yeah, well… at least they make you feel better. All right. We should keep going.

Varl: Might want to grab more of these plants along the way.

Aloy: Yeah. Good idea.

Varl: Look there. More of the blight.

Aloy: (coughs) Some of the blight is… peeling off. Like dead skin. Is that how it spreads?

Varl: Ugh.

Aloy: Those ruins. That's where we need to go. 

Varl: I see a few ways down. What are we after exactly?

Aloy: The backup? Well it's an AI. It's… hard to explain. Think of it like… a set of instructions that can fix the world.

Varl: Sounds complicated. Noticed you’re traveling light these days.

Aloy: Yeah, I ran into some trouble on the way here and lost a lot of my gear. (coughs a few times) This stuff spreads fast.

Varl: Six months ago the land was fine. Now it's everywhere.

Aloy: Glinthawks.

Varl: Salvaging machine carcasses, as usual. And there they go.

Aloy: Looks like they left a carcass behind.

[They find a destroyed machine by climbing down a rusty staircase.]

Aloy: A lot of arrows in that machine. Better take a closer look. Someone took down this machine recently.

Varl: Who else would come here?

Aloy: I don't know. We'd better craft some arrows of our own. There might be trouble up ahead.

Varl: Good thing we already picked up some Ridge-Wood.

Aloy: All right. Now to craft some arrows. Done.

Varl: Me too. Arrows ready. There's a ladder. But can't reach it from here.

Aloy: Nothing a well-placed arrow can't knock free. Just have to target the lock.

[She shoots her bow at the lock and the ladder goes down.]

Varl: That did it. After you.

[They come out into a large overgrown clearing.]

Varl: By the Goddess. What was this place?

Aloy: I don't know. The transmission the, uh, message found didn't say. Only that a backup might be here. We need to find a way in. So… what happened after I left Meridian?

Varl: Well, there was a fuss when people realized you were gone. But then some of us figured you only would've left if it were for something important.

Aloy: You were right about that. The blight's not just poisoning plants. It's killing animals, too.

Varl: Then people will get sick, too. And starve?

Aloy: We're not going to let that happen.

Varl: Find anything good?

Aloy: A few supplies. Down this way.

[They go on and encounter a machine that looks like a Watcher, but behaves like a gopher.]

Aloy: (quietly) Get to the grass!

Varl: Never seen one of those before.

Aloy: Me neither. Those dead machines have it on alert.

Varl: How do you want to handle it?

Aloy: The Focus can help us. We can scan the machine before we make our move.

Varl: Okay.

Aloy: Give me a second… Okay. See how parts of it are glowing? Those are its weak spots.

Varl: Got it. Its eye. It's a weak spot.

Aloy: Right. Okay concentrate.

[She throws a stone to distract the machine, after which Aloy and Varl shoot it.]

Varl: Another one's coming! How does the focus know all that?

Aloy: It reads data on the machine.

Varl: Like a hunter studying its prey?

Aloy: Yeah. Kind of. So, after the fuss over me leaving, what did everyone else do?

Varl: Well, as soon as the celebration was over, my mother led the rest of the Nora home. The Sun King put his people to work rebuilding the city. And I set out to find you. Someone shot this machine, too.

Aloy: Another ladder. Need to shoot off the lock.

Varl: You said you've had a Focus since you were a child, right?

Aloy: Yeah. Found my first one. When I fell into a ruin. Got the others from an old cache not long ago. It's good to have extras.

[They find some old and overgrown ruins of an old building.]

Synthetic Voice: Welcome to the Far Zenith Launch Facility.

Aloy: Far Zenith? I know they made some tech trades with Zero Dawn… but why would they have a backup of GAIA?

Synthetic Voice: Please register with reception for the tour.

Varl: I guess they want us to check in with them?

Synthetic Voice: Please hold for identiscan. Access denied. Please wait here for personnel to assist you, Dr. Sobeck.

Aloy: Okay. I guess they weren't on great terms with Elisabet. Well, let's find a way in.

[Varl tries to use the scanner too.]

Synthetic Voice: Please hold for identiscan. Access denied. Credentials not recognized.

Varl: I guess it doesn't like me, either.

Aloy: I should be able to pry this open. There's climbing gear. Guess someone dropped in from above. Whoever left this here might've also shot those machines we found earlier.

Varl: So where are they now? Ugh, what's that stench?

[They find a destroyed camp.]

Aloy: An entire camp… wiped out. They must've come here to delve for scrap.

Varl: Acid - that explains the smell. And it looks like something big came in from above.

Aloy: Crashed right through the camp… and then through the wall. I should take a look at the rubble in that gap. Whatever came through here brought this down as it went out. If I can dislodge some of the debris. we might be able to squeeze through. Maybe I can find something to help in the camp.

Varl: Aloy over here. I think I got something. It's some kind of Oseram prototype. I think. This hook looks like it can latch on to things.

Aloy: And this gear pulls it back. Hmm.

Varl: It looks broken, but maybe we can repair it? Hook it to the debris…

Aloy: …and pull it out. That could work. The Focus can help us search the camp and identify anything we can use to fix the tool. My Focus picked up a couple of things to check out.

Varl: Poor guy. Acid burned right through his armor.

Aloy: Part of a machine. Could help fix the gears. Machine cable. Stronger than rope. All right. I think I have what I need to repair the tool… or maybe even make something better.

Varl: You could use this workbench.

Aloy: There - a Pullcaster. No to test it on the debris. Got it.

[She uses the Pullcaster to break up the pile of rocks blocking the passageway.]

Varl: Whoa!

Aloy: That worked better than I thought. Well, it doesn't look like there's an easy way out of here. I should scan the area. We have to find a way to keep going. What's this?

[She found a console.]

Varl: Huh. What's this thing for? 

[Aloy pushes some buttons and a holographic image of a villainous white man appears before them.]

Varl: Whoa!

Osvald Dalgaard: Good morning! I'm Osvald Dalgaard, and it is my pleasure to introduce you to… Far Zenith. Forget what you think you know about us. Our truth is simple. We say, "reach for the stars!" even if you have to cross 8.6 light years of space to get there! Please proceed into the auditorium, where we'll unveil our plans!

Varl: Wonder what's in this "auditorium."

Aloy: Hmm. Pulse didn't turn up much. I better scan. Guess we'll find out. Hmm. I might be able to get up there. Don't think I can reach that ladder from here.

[She uses the Pullcaster to pull herself to the far end of the room.]

Aloy: Wow. That worked.

Varl: That Pullcaster's useful. Too bad there's only one.

Aloy: Don't worry. I'll find you another way up. Okay, I gotta drop the ladder for Varl. There you go, Varl.

Varl: Thanks.

[They enter the next room and encounter Oswald's hologram again.]

Osvald Dalgaard: Humans - Homo sapiens. Us. We have always pushed the boundaries explorers, pioneers, trailblazers. That's why we're proud to have resurrected the Odyssey. What our governments abandoned in orbit. Far Zenith will actualize in less than a decade. But that's only the beginning. When the ship is complete, we will send the Odyssey and her crew where no one's gone before… …the Sirius system. There, we'll create humanity's first off-world colony. The Odyssey may take 300 years to reach it, but when we look up at the night sky, we'll know they're on their way. And in the words of our founder the late Peter Tshivhumbe. "the truest form of immortality is--"

Synthetic Voice: Data corrupt. Playback stopped.

Varl: The Old Ones could fly through the sky? Between the stars?

Aloy: Well, yes - sort of. That ship, the Odyssey - it never made it to the other star. Something went wrong, and it blew up. 

[They enter the next room.]

Aloy: Is that why Elisabet gave them a backup of GAIA? For their colony?

Synthetic Voice: Error: Public presentation file corrupted. Member Recruitment file available. Do you wish to reactivate?

Aloy: Yeah - reactivate. Let's see what else they had to say.

[The hologram appears again.]

Osvald Dalgaard: We all know the projections. Economic instability. New bio-contagions. Rampant AIs. How long before another catastrophe create unacceptable risk for the world's elite? We here at Far Zenith believe, escape the inevitable. And so we reach for the stars. Now, you've seen what we're building here. Infrastructure to support the Odyssey's construction. A state-of-the-art Data Center to facilitate rapid technological advancements. And, you've seen how we're managing public perception. So invest, and join us. Claim your berth on the Odyssey. Preserve your way of life beyond the concerns of Earth.

Aloy: Well, they were right about the world ending. They just didn't know how… yet.

Varl: So everything they said back there… about the next step for humanity. It was all a lie. These people only cared about saving their own skin.

Aloy: Yeah, well… didn't work out for them in the end. That Osvald guy mentioned a Data Center. 

[She pushes a button and a large metal shutters on the side slides open.]

Aloy: There. The backup… it should be stored in there.

Varl: Won't be able to swim across.

Aloy: I guess we'll have to find a way around. Come on.

Varl: The wilds have really grown over this place.

Aloy: That did the tricks. Deeper into the creepy ruin we go.

[A huge machine that looks like a snake crawls over our heroes in the mountains.]

Varl: Above us! What is that thing?

Aloy: I don't know. Might've been what killed those Oseram. Keep your guard up.

Varl: Oh, my guard is up.

Aloy: Up here. Careful. Don't want those things to cally in some friends from underground. Let's take them out quietly. You take the left one. I'll deal with the one on the right.

Varl: Okay. Moving up. 

Aloy: I need to sneak up on it to take it out with my spear. Can't let it see me. I should scan it first. Check its patrol path. Got to get closer. And stay out of sight. I can throw a rock to distract it. Let it into a position where I can sneak up and strike. Just have to wait for the right moment. Got you!

Varl: Mine's down too! More of those machines ahead.

Aloy: Nothing you and I can't handle.

Varl: Are you ready for this?

Aloy: Got 'em all. I've been meaning to mention… I noticed you have a new look these days.

Varl: Yeah, I know. Didn't have a lot of time to shave when I was trying to catch up to you.

Varl: Don't worry. It's not permanent.

Aloy: Good.

Varl: Sorry my whiskers offend you, Anointed.

Aloy: Looks like this little guy got caught up in the blight. Couldn't escape.

Varl: I hope it didn't suffering long.

Aloy: The Oseram must've used explosives against the machines.

Varl: They managed to get a couple.

Aloy: Looks like there was a barricade here. Machines must've broken through. Keep this for later.

Varl: Guess that Oseram didn't have a chance to use it. Careful. Traps ahead.

Aloy: Hmm. Might be able to disarm them. There. Managed to salvage some supplies. Dismantled it. And got more supplies.

Varl: And not blow yourself up.

Aloy: Looks like another camp.

Varl: While we're here, maybe we can make some traps of our own? Might come in handy against machines.

Aloy: Good idea. Hmm. I don't have the right supplies to craft a trap. But it looks like the Oseram shot off some machine parts. I might be able to scrounge up enough materials from them. I can use this. Okay. I should have what I need to craft a trap.

Varl: If anything walks into one of those, it won't know what hit it. Over here. Aloy. I think I see a way up.

Aloy: Machines ahead!

Varl: Don't think they spotted us.

Aloy: I better scan them.

Varl: I've seen this machine before. A Scrounger.

Aloy: It's new to me. Let's see where its weak points are.

Varl: Maybe we could place one of those traps you made in its path.

Aloy: Set this here.

Varl: Nice one. We're clear.

Aloy: Let's keep going, then.

Varl: You've been in a lot of Old World ruins. Are they all like this?

Aloy: Let's hope it doesn't come this way.

Varl: That's a big storm picking up out there.

Aloy: Yeah. And they're getting stronger. And more frequent.

Varl: So the storms. The blighted lands. The rivers and lakes choked with algae. You were born to fix all that?

Aloy: Yeah, but I can only do it if I find that backup. I think we're winding our way around to the Data Center. We'll need to cut through that big building on the right out there. Hey, Varl. There's data here. You scan it with your Focus. Hmm. This data mentions the tech that Far Zenith traded with Zero Dawn. But it doesn't explain how they got a backup.

Varl: I'll keep an eye out for more data. Let's see… huh. A lot of glyphs. I'll tuck this away to study later.

Aloy: Looks like we've gotta climb up. Ah.

Varl: You okay?

Aloy: Yeah. Guess we won't be going that way.

Varl: This place is really falling apart.

Aloy: Well, it is a thousand years old. Well it is a thousands. Looks like some kind of meeting room. That door on the other side's locked. 

[Finally Aloy and Varl find another console. Aloy pushes some buttons and a word appears on the holographic screen.]

Aloy: "Anzu"?

[In front of our heroes appear the graphics and names of the various Zero Dawn structures.]

Woman's Voice: The Zero Dawn terraforming system - the brainchild of Dr. Elisabet Sobeck. Empowered by nine subordinate functions, GAIA, the core of the system is capable of advanced planetary engineering… …an obvious advantage to our space colonization efforts. Operation Phase 1: Establish an asset within Project Zero Dawn Status: Complete. Phase 2: The asset will secretly beamcast a complete copy of GAIA and her subordinate functions to this facility's Data Center. If all goes well, Zero Dawn staff will remain completely unaware of the transmission. Risks: Discovery of this operation could result in Zero Dawn withholding the already negotiated APOLLO database. Special care must be taken not to alert Travis Tate, the expert hacker in charge of the HADES protocol. In addition, extreme caution must be exercised in regards to Dr. Sobeck herself. As one of the world's pre-eminent technologists, she may have instituted unforeseen security measures. A complete assessment is attached. This concludes the executive summary.

Aloy: I thought Elisabet sent the backup here… but she didn't. Far Zenith stole GAIA.

Varl: Aloy… why does that woman look like you?

Aloy: It's okay Varl. We look alike because… were the exact same. Genetically identical.

Varl: But she was one of the Old Ones. How can you be her?

Aloy: Because I wasn't born, I was made… by a machine. It's why I'm motherless. Why I was cast out as an infant.

Varl: I don't understand. What kind of machine can make a person?

Aloy: Remember when I said the backup is like a set of instructions? It's more than that. It's called GAIA. And for a long time, she cared for the world, until she had to destroy herself. So she made me to bring her back. I'm the only one who can. And this place is my last hope.

Varl: You once said the Goddess spoke to you when you went into All-Mother Mountain. Was that this GAIA?

Aloy: Yes. But she's not the Goddess, Varl. There isn't one.

Varl: How can you be sure? It sounds like she anointed you with a sacred task.

Aloy: (sighs) I've had a lot of time to figure this out. And you will, too, with the Focus. But for now… The report said they were going to store the stolen copy of GAIA in the Data Center. So that's where we have to go. Okay?

[Varl walks away without a word.]

Varl: Huh. Look at that. Aloy, over here. I found something you could use.

Aloy: A weapon. Thanks, Varl. We should keep moving.

Varl: After you.

Aloy: Down here. I think we're almost back outside.

Varl: Good. 

[They see the machine snake again.]

Varl: Look! That must be the machine!

Aloy: And it's heading in the same direction we're going. Great. Another one of those machines. I could try out that new weapon on it.

[She uses the slingshot found by Varl and shoots freezing projectiles at the machines.]

Varl: Good hit! It's already brittle, Aloy!

Aloy: I can do more damage to it while it's brittle! Gotcha!

Varl: Machine couldn't take the cold.

Aloy: More of the Oseram delvers. And a lot of acid. That big machine must've attacked as they tried to escape.

Varl: They didn't stand a chance.

Aloy: Looks like we can cross over here.

Varl: So, you said this backup is the last hope?

Aloy: Yeah. All those places I’ve been these last few months? There were supposed to be more backups, but a thousand years ago a guy named Ted Faro purged them all.

Varl: Was he part of Far Zenith too?

Aloy: No. He was worse.

Varl: Wow. That big metal thing looks like the ship we saw back in the auditorium. Imagine going up to the stars in that.

Aloy: (finds a corpse) More Oseram. Machines tore right through them.

Varl: These guys couldn't catch a break. Machines patrolling ahead.

Aloy: We can tag them in the Focus to keep track of them. Okay. Now how to get out of here?

Varl: Machine ripped right through the wall.

Aloy: What's in here?

Varl: There's a ladder in the back.

Aloy: So, tell me something. Sona was really okay with you not going back to the Sacred Lands?

Varl: As the Nora War-Chief, she understood why I was obligated to follow you. But as my mother… she wasn’t pleased.

Aloy: Is she ever pleased? I don't think I've seen her smile.

Varl: Me neither. 

[They climb on top of a building and see three cobra-like machines fighting each other.]

Varl: Three of those things. And if they slaughtered all those Oseram, we'll never get through to the Data Center.

Aloy: There's no way to slip past them… and they're too tough to fight head-on.

Varl: We could find a settlement, convince some hunters to help us…

Aloy: That would take weeks. And we don't have that kind of time. Maybe all we need is that shuttle to fall.

Varl: That thing? How?

Aloy: I'll figure it out. Just wait here.

Varl: Aloy!

Aloy: Trust me.

Varl: And… there she goes.

Aloy: Just need to get over to the shuttle to figure out how to make it fall into the basin. 

[She uses her rope to epically slide down to the ground.]

Aloy: If I can make it to that tower, I should be able to find a way across to the shuttle. There. That ladder can get me up the tower. Okay. There's a rail up there. I think I can reach it if I launch myself off that grapple point. Got it! Well, that sounds good. Storm's getting bad. Made it. Easy! That was close. One rickety tower down. On to the next. I won't be able to make that jump. But there is a cable here. Maybe I can ride it to the other side. Uh… Whoa! Well nowhere to go but up. This place is barely holding together. Looks like there are massive clamps holding the shuttle in place. I'll bet there's a control console nearby. If I can release the clamps, the shuttle should fall right into the basin. Great. More machines in my way. Control console might be in there. Okay. Time to crush those machines down below. 

[Several thick metal cables break under the weight of the rusted shuttle, but it is still held by two cables.]

Aloy: The shuttle's caught up in those cables. I'm gonna have to climb the tower to find a way to disconnect them. Now how to get up the tower? Scanning with my Focus could help here. Down it goes. I've got to climb closer to the shuttle to detach the cables. Okay, that creaking doesn't sound good. This should be the right spot. There. That connector's holding the cables together. It should break if I shoot it. One down. Now I just need to climb higher and detach the second set of cables. Scaling an ancient, rickety tower with killer machines waiting down below. Maybe Varl was right. But no turning back now. Almost there. There's the other connector. 

[One of the cables breaks, but the other continues to hold the shuttle. Several pieces fall off, pressing down on the kite. Victory! However, the shuttle's enormous weight begins to destroy the structure Aloy was climbing.]

Aloy: Oh, shit! Shit! 

[She dodges the debris and clings to the falling railing, then jumps onto the debris on the ground and runs as fast as she can from the falling pile of rusty metal. The squashed snake snarls at her in a powerless rage.]

Aloy: Not going anywhere, are you? 

[But the snake manages to free itself! By the way, it is called Slitherfang.]

Aloy: Guess we're finishing this the hard way. I need to take this thing down to get to the Data Center should scan for weak spots. Okay. Where's the weak spot? That sac's full of acid should target it first. Whoa! Still got some fight left in you. Ha ha! Try spitting at me now! There! Those canisters are exposed now. I should aim for them! Damn it, it broke free! Gotta take this thing down fast! A trap, maybe? Frost ammo? Or my Focus might find something I can use around here. 

[She finds… a heavy gun called a Coil Blaster!]

Aloy: Let's see what this can do. How do you like that?

[With the Blaster she easily destroys Slitherfang.]

Aloy: It’s dead. Finally. The Data Center should be straight ahead. I guess Varl's gonna have to find another way there. Once I get the backup, I can reboot GAIA. Fix the system, heal the blight. Restore Elisabet's dream. But is it still there? 

[She enters the Data Center.]

Aloy: Okay. I should find the server room. I'm close. I have to be. Please be here. It's here!

GAIA: GAIA version 6.9. Initializing. Hello.

Aloy: Hi…!

[Next to the hologram of GAIA, a black woman in a golden toga, appears a hologram of Elisabet Sobeck.]

Aloy: Elisabet…? 

[From behind the leg of the huge hologram of Elisabet comes out a regular-sized hologram of Travis.]

Aloy: Travis Tate… 

Travis Tate: Now what's this we got here? A Far Zenith conspiracy to steal a copy of GAIA and her subordinate functions? Naughty-naughty! You want me to handle this, Lis? 

[Elisabet's hologram smiles and crosses her arms over her chest.]

Travis Tate: (mockingly) Blasphemers Brood of vipers with a mighty hand, I smite and pour troubles upon you! 

[He theatrically throws the tablet in his hands against the floor, shoots from his fingers and acts like an idiot. Aloy is annoyed by this behavior. "👆Thou shalt not steal👆 A Super Advanced Terraforming System" appears in the air.]

Travis Tate: This ain't no copy of GAIA you stole, you losers - but it's the mother of all logic bombs! So, good luck repairing your data. And next time you start thinking you can outsmart a Tate, remember my salute.

[He flips the finger with both hands. Aloy steps aside and sits on a ledge in the wall. She covers her face with her hands. Varl enters.]

Varl: Aloy? The Goddess…?

Aloy: (annoyed) There is no Goddess! I told you that already. That's not GAIA, it's not what I'm looking for - it's nothing but a fake!

[They leave the Data Center and climb a mountain. Aloy climbs in first and holds out his hand to Varl, but he politely declines.]

Varl: I got it.

Aloy: Varl. I'm sorry.

Varl: You have a sharp bite sometimes you know? But it was pretty amazing to see you fly off that tower and blow up the entire basin.

Aloy: The thing is, there's going to be more of that. I'm out of leads, Varl, but I have to keep searching, and fast. And whatever risks I have to take, I will. And it doesn't make sense to have someone with me. Someone who might get hurt. This is on me, Varl. Nobody else.

Varl: Hold on. Before, in Meridian, you said there was a man who helped you… Sylens. You said you used to talk to him a lot about things you discovered from the Old World, things no one else understands. And he gave you the lance you used to defeat HADES.

Aloy: He's gone, Varl. I haven't heard from him since the battle against HADES.

Varl: Sure, but Spymaster Marad, back in Meridian - he's good at finding people, isn't he?

Aloy: Varl…

Varl: Come on - it might work. Plus, you'll get to see some friendly faces again.

Aloy: Okay. I guess it's worth a shot.

Varl: We've got a long walk ahead.

Aloy: Actually, I've got a better idea.

[They find themself two Chargers and ride to Meridian. Varl struggles to stay on its back, but in time he manages to control the machine. They enter the city.]

THE POINT OF THE LANCE
Carja Citizen: By the Sun, it's true! She's come back!

Carja Citizen: (gives Aloy some flowers)  Bless us! The Savior of Meridian has returned!

Varl: You earned this welcome. You saved them.

Aloy: Not yet.

Blameless Marad: In the name of the Sun-King Avad, a royal welcome for the Champion! Make way!

Varl: Marad. Aloy nastan urgent matter to discuss.

Blameless Marad: Does she? That makes two of us. I've sent forth hunters for weeks, to Sunfall all the way to the Sacred Land, searching for you. Something happened at the Spire. Come. I’ll show you. Watch your step. You saved us all, to be sure, but we're still cleaning up the mess. It happened right after the solstice. We were able to explain it away, thank the sun. Otherwise, it might have caused a panic. One night, for less than half a minute, it glowed an angry red. From Meridian it looked like a trick of the light. But those who were closer, atop the Alight, said it could not have been a reflection rose up from the tower's base. From that. We left everything just as it was.

Varl: What do you think happened?

Aloy: I don't know. The Spire's supposed to send out signals - messages - for the terraforming system.

Varl: But HADES tried to use it to wake up ancient war machines.

Aloy: I was sure I cut the connection to that thing. Wait here while I check it out.

Varl: Let us know what you find.

Aloy: I've got a bad feeling about this. Never could pull this thing out of --

[She takes the spear out of the orb where HADES was kept.]

Aloy: What?

[She uses her Focus on the spear.]

Text: Transmission. Activity log - Data payload transmitting, Broadcast connection established.

Aloy: “Transmission?”

[Some red evil looking energy stream escapes the orb.]

Aloy: What the--?

[The spear crumbles in Aloy’s hands.]

Aloy: No. He wouldn't. He couldn't… Something was transmitted from the top of the Spire. Guess I have to find a way up there.

[She returns to Varl.]

Aloy: Uh… is that a statue of me? That's new.

Varl: What did you find?

Aloy: Not done yet But it definitely looks like the ord transmitted something into the Spire.

Varl: That can't be good.

Aloy: I guess I should be flattered by the statue. It feels wrong, especially when my job's only half done. 

[She finds a small altar.]

Aloy: Looks like a memorial. “Honoring those who fell in the Battle of the Alight.” Lots of brave people defended this place from HADES.

[She looks around.]

Aloy: Machine carcasses. Remnants from the Battle of the Alight.

Oseram Worker: It's really you! You're a real life legend!

[Aloy starts climbing to the Spire.]

Aloy: We were almost overrun by the machines HADES controlled But we pushed through. There we go. Now how to cross over to the Spire? Got it. Should be able to get up there now. I thought Sylens was helping me when he gave me his lance. But it looks like he tricked me. It transmitted something through the Spire. Did he save HADES? Why would he do that? Well it can figure out where he sent it. I can track him down. Hopefully the transmission node at the top will tell me. Looks like this panel's ajar. Can I go up through the inside? An elevator? Let's see.

[She activates the elevator with her spear.]

Synthetic Voice: Access lift activated.

Aloy: My lucky day.

Synthetic Voice: Engaging maintenance configuration.

Aloy: The whole thing is opening up! Wonder what the Carja will make of this. 

[She takes the elevator to the top of the Spire.]

Aloy: There's the node. 

[She activates the knot with her spear. The giant building shoots a blue laser somewhere in the distance.]

Aloy: Somewhere to the far west. Bastard.

[Sylens hologram appears.]

Sylens: Well, Aloy, I see you finally figured it out. To be honest, I'm surprised it took you so long to discover my ruse.

Aloy: You rigged the lance to steal HADES? How could you be so reckless?

Sylens: Reckless? You're the one who tried to purge HADES before its precious knowledge could be… extracted. The Mysterious Signal that woke it, for example… or where to obtain one of those GAIA backups you've been having such a hard time finding.

Aloy: If you knew, why didn't you just tell me?

Sylens: I've been having problems of my own these past six months, Aloy. The difference is, I've made progress. So once your anger at my entirely necessary deception has faded… Why don't you come out here and find me in the Forbidden West and learn all that ye discovered?

Aloy: Oh, I'll come find you, all right.

Sylens: Yes, well the coordinates should make it simple enough, even for you.

[The hologram disappears. Aloy slams the air in fury.]

Aloy: (sighs) There's no other choice. 

[She climbs down.]

Aloy: Better let Varl and Marad know what I've found.

Varl: Aloy always has a way of doing the incredible. You went inside it… and it transformed… almost like the day of the battle.

Blameless Marad: I can only be grateful that it's a stormy day. Few will have seen the tower change from Meridian. What did you discover?

Aloy: HADES… The danger didn't end here. It went into the Forbidden West, and I have to follow.

Blameless Marad: I see. That can be difficult. The west is called "forbidden" for a reason. A tribe of ferocious warriors controls much of it - the Tenakth. And they allow no trespassers past its border. That said, under the Sun-King Avad, a fragile peace has been negotiated. And indeed, the next embassy will take place in a day or two on the edge of the frontier. Were you to attend the gathering under his auspices, the Tenakth might grant right of passage, instead of hunting you and attacking on sight.

Aloy: Great, just what I need, more killers--

[The sound of the horn is heard.]

Blameless Marad: Ah, The Sun-King.

Avad: Aloy. It's good to see you. You left in such haste, we never had a chance to properly thank you--

Itamen: Can we show the Champion the spear now? Please?

Nasadi: Itamen! Quiet!

Avad: It's true - we bear gifts.

Avad: Decorum usually calls for a ceremony of offering at the palace, but I thought you'd prefer a less formal occasion. Bring them, please.

Aloy: Avad, this is all very kind, but I-- Uthid. Vanasha!

Vanasha: Quick, better hand them over before she runs off again!

Uthid: Really, must you?

[He gives Aloy a new spear and Vanasha gives her a headband.]

Varl: Try it on.

Aloy: It's beautiful.

Avad: On behalf of all the citizens of the Sundom, may these tokens remind you of our eternal gratitude.

Blameless Marad: Perhaps you'd like to spend more time with your friends. Come speak to me when you're ready to depart.

Aloy: I need to attach the Master Override to my new spear should be a workbench around here I can use.

[She approaches Avad talking to some man.]

Carja Citizen: Shipments continue to arrive weekly from Cut Cliffs.

[Awad signs to the man to leave and casts a glance at the statue of Aloy.]

Avad: The sculptor wanted something even bigger - twice the size, covered in gold and jewels. But I was quite certain you wouldn't appreciate that.

Aloy: You were right. I'm sorry, Avad. It's good to see you, but I can't stay long.

Avad: I see. I had hoped you'd remain in the city for a time perhaps at the Palace.

Aloy: Meridian's still in danger - but it's bigger than that. To put things right, I have to go west. Tenakth territory.

Avad: By the Sun, the Tenakth? Well. Perhaps Marad already told you, but after years of hostility. Another embassy will be held in just a day or two.

Aloy: When you say “years of hostility” I assume you mean the Red Raids?

Avad: Ah, yes. My favorite subject.

Aloy: I wouldn't ask if I didn't need to know.

Avad: As you know, my father raided all the border tribes. The Oseram, Banuk, and Nora suffered greatly resisting as best they could. But none fought back like the Tenakth. They rose up and assaulted our western front at Barren Light sweeping us from their lands. Getting them to talk to us again after that was tricky.

Aloy: What makes this coming Embassy so special?

Avad: Just like today, it is special because of the guest. Our delegation will meet with the Tenakth just outside Barren Light. Well give them treasure… …and they'll return a prisoner - Fashav, one of our finest soldiers.

Aloy: Soldier? Don't you mean raider?

Avad: No, not in this case. Fashav is my cousin nothing like Helis and his ilk. He joined the western expedition with the hopes of reining in certain… excesses. But he was captured during a heroic defense of our forward base at Cinnabar Sands, and has been held ever since.

Aloy: Your cousin Fashav - how long has he been a Tenakth captive?

Avad: Five years. Tenakth emissaries swear he is well, but I wonder. That tribe is renowned for its brutality. How did he survive? Well know soon enough. If you see him before I do, tell him that Tawalt him in Meridian where he belongs.

Aloy: If I see him, I will. How did you get the Tenakth to talk again after the war?

Avad: The same way I got you to talk. By giving gifts.

Aloy: Ha. The Tenakth like tiaras?

Avad: More like metals, spices, and relics looted during the fighting. We've met with them on several occasions, and the gifts seem to have eased the tension. But this coming Embassy is the most important yet the best sign we've had so far that the Tenakth want lasting peace.

Aloy: Itamen looks happy.

Avad: You got him out of Sunfall. Any happiness he has, he owes to you. He stumped into a fine young man. Which he'll need to be if he's to inherit the crown.

Aloy: Wouldn't the crown go to a son of yours first?

Avad: Yes, well, I'd have to get married for that to happen.

Avad: Marad keeps throwing noble matches at me… …but I find I'm always trying to make them into someone they're not. (Aloy smiles) At any rate, I never aspired to the throne and I don't wish to sit there forever. When Itamen comes of age I hope to step aside. Free of the crown. I might finally be able to travel the world. Who knows? Perhaps even accompany you on one of your adventures.

Aloy: You make it sound easy. I need to get going.

Avad: One moment, Aloy… there's something I must ask you. Since you left I've thought of little else.

Aloy: This isn't really the time…

Avad: But it has to be. The way you left before… there's no way to know when I'll see you again. I'm not trying to stop you. or hold you back. But I need to know… When your mission is over, will you return to Meridian? And stay? Long enough for us to… spend time to… get to know each other properly, perhaps?

Aloy: (clever answer) Avad, the situation calls for a… higher perspective. The threat I'm facing endangers not just Meridian but a lot of other places, too. A lot of innocent people. What happens between us. It's not important. At least, not yet.

Avad: You're right. I'm acting like a fool. It's supposed to be the king who calls for higher perspective. Please accept my apology - and my wishes for your success. Goodbye, Aloy. As always, our hopes ride with you.

Aloy: Well… time to head west.

Avad: May the Sun bless your path.

[Aloy approaches Nasadi and Itamen.]

Aloy: Dowager Queen Nasadi. (bows)

Nasadi: Blessed Champion. Itamen, what do you say?

Itamen: My humblest thanks to you great Champion, for delivering my mother and me from Sunfall… and for defending our Holy City against the forces of Shadow. Did I say it right?

Aloy: You said it fine, Itamen. And you're welcome.

Itamen: Champion, will you teach me how to shoot like a real machine hunter?

Nasadi: Itamen!

Aloy: I have to go on an important mission, Prince--

Itamen: To save the world?

Aloy: Something like that. But when I come back, I could give you a few tips. It would be an honor.

Nasadi: We owe you our lives, Champion, and we will not forget. May the Sun light your way.

Itamen: Watch out for Thunderjaws, Champion!

[Aloy searches around for a workbench.]

Garja Guard: Savior. I hope all is well with you.

Aloy: That's part of the Deathbringer we defeated. This machine was the last line of defense for HADES. It dragged the orb up here and then nearly killed me. But as just a piece of scrap now. There. A workbench.

[She approaches Vanasha and Uthid standing nearby.]

Aloy: Uthid, Nanasha. Thanks for being here.

Vanasha: Wouldn't miss it… even if you did leave us hanging after the big battle.

Uthid: Vanasha, stop. She's here now, isn't she?

Vanasha: For the moment. But I see that look on her face. She's got business to attend to, and it isn't in Meridian.

Aloy: You know I didn't vanish before because I wanted to. I had…

Vanasha: Little huntress, please. You don't have to justify yourself to us. You saved our butts. If you've gotta go, go. With our blessing.

Uthid: Always.

Aloy: You both look like you're doing well.

Vanasha: Mr. Shinypants here is now the Sun King's Senior Military Advisor. That means people actually have to listen to him talk, may the Sun bless their sorry souls.

Uthid: At least I say something of substance every once in a while.

Vanasha: What was that? I just fell asleep while you were talking.

Aloy: And how about you, Vanasha?

Vanasha: I've been looking after Nasadi and Itamen. Two parts bodyguard, one part--

Uthid: Bad influence.

Vanasha: Huh. I was going to say "nanny," but I like your version better.

Aloy: I never pictured you as a nanny. Itamen must be special.

Vanasha: Hold on now. I'm not entirely domesticated. Nasadi was the Mad Sun King's wife - she has enemies. I've had to foil a plot or two.

Uthid: Right. You can try to hide it, but inside, you're as soft as a silk pillow.

Vanasha: Oh, you have no idea.

Uthid: Uh… oh dear.

Aloy: We were talking about Itamen?

Vanasha: Yeah, okay. I admit it. Itamen's cute, he's fun, and he looks up to me. I like him. Except when he forgets to wash his hands after hooking worms in that muddy garden behind the solarium. Blech.

Aloy: It's been months since I was in Sunfall. What's become of the Shadow Carja?

Vanasha: Ha. After you wiped out the Eclipse, there were hardly any priests or officers left to terrorize the little people.

Uthid: Avad offered amnesty to all who were forced to serve the Shadow, so the commoners cleaned out the citadel and handed it back to him. The Sundom was unified.

Vanasha: Avad wanted Uthid to take command of the garrison there, but Captain Cuddly here refused. Rumor has it that he wanted to stay close to me here in Meridian.

Uthid: That's nonsense, of course.

Aloy: Well--

Vanasha: I know, I know. You're out. Go! Away with you!

Uthid: Always an honor, Champion.

Vanasha: Always a pleasure. But please, little huntress. Come back someday and tell us about your adventures. If I can't get in trouble, at least I can hear about yours.

[Aloy upgrades her new spear.]

Aloy: Okay. Master Override installed. Plus something new, to store up and release energy - a "Resonator." Should help in a fight.

[She returns to Marad and Varl.]

Blameless Marad: Are you ready to go? Or do you need a little more time?

Aloy: I'd better get going. And if I'm headed west, it sounds like I'll need right of passage from the Tenakth, as you said. Where exactly is this Embassy going to be held?

Blameless Marad: Past the Daunt - the canyon that marks the western border of the Sundom. You'll find the fortress of Barren Light at its farthest edge. The Embassy will take place just beyond its gates. It's a long march - a fortnight on foot.

Varl: A couple of days of hard riding should get us there.

Aloy: Actually, it might be better to rest here tonight, head out in the morning.

Blameless Marad: Of course. I'll arrange it.

[He takes them somewhere. Varl almost immediately falls asleep sitting in his chair. Scarlet goes to his room. At dawn she sets off alone. Aloy gallops across the steppes and plains, meeting all sorts of mechanical fauna along the way. After a long and arduous journey, she arrives at the snow-covered mountains in the north, where she is met by a local resident. He sits next to the car elevator.]

Karhn: Sparks to steel! Ha! Never seen anyone use one of those to get around!

Aloy: Is that how I get to Barren Light?

Karhn: Uh, yes. I mean, usually! But not today uh not yet.

Aloy: And why is that?

Karhn: Well, the Baunt the whole valley it's infested with machines.

Aloy: I can handle machines.

Karhn: I'm sure you can But I'm under strict orders not to operate until the whistle down at Chainscrape sounds the all-clear!

Aloy: Look. I didn't come all this way just to stand around and wait. I'll crank that car down myself if I have to.

Karhn: Well, but then who would crank it back up? Eh, fine! Fine! 

[He lets Aloy in.]

Karhn: Though, should anyone ask, it might be best to say you forced me.

[They slowly start to descend downward.]

Aloy: I see smoke. But not a lot of activity.

Karhn: Smoke's probably coming from something the machines wrecked. As for the quiet well, there's a work stoppage in effect because of all the fuss.

Aloy: What sort of machines are causing the trouble?

Karhn: Nasty ones, and lots of 'em! Bristlebacks, they're called. The strangeness is, they're not native to the Daunt. Just showed up all of a sudden.

Aloy: No hunters to kill them?

Karhn: Oh, we've got hunters, just none that want to cross Ulvund. Boss of Chainscrape, he is self-appointed. Work stoppage was his idea.

Aloy: Yeah, well. I'm just passing through. Got an Embassy to attend.

Karhn: You should've said! That ain't gonna happen no time soon!

Aloy: What are you talking about?

Karhn: Hear that? That's your answer.

Aloy: Who is that?

Karhn: Carja Sun-Priest. Cranked him down yesterday, 'bout an hour before the machine trouble started. He's a very important man or so he says. That Embassy at Barren Light? He's the one supposed to run it. Ha!

Aloy: Great.

[They reach the ground. Aloy sees the priest reprimanding his, apparently, guard.]

Studious Vuadis: If you don't do as I say immediately, the Sun-King himself shall hear of your insolence! Thanks to you, I was forced to spend the night shivering in the tent! Exposed to attack I might have died! Me, you refuse to transport! But not this, this… what? This Nora girl? This savage? Aside, scalawag!

Joruf: Vuadis - that's Aloy!

Studious Vuadis: STUDIOUS Vuadis!

Joruf: Aloy? You know - Savior of Meridian?!

Studious Vuadis: Really? Well that lessens the insult I suppose.

Aloy: I came here for the Embassy at Barren Light. Way I hear it, so did you.

Studious Vuadis: Well, not with the valley infested! (reads from his scroll) "And so did Araman proclaim the Sun-Priests most precious and worthy of safekeeping" See? Scripture! I shall head to Barren Light when the Captain of the Vanguard tells me the way is clear, and not a moment sooner!

Aloy: Fine. Captain's a friend of mine, you know. (to Joruf) Where is Erend? Wouldn't mind talking to someone a little more action, a little less scroll.

Joruf: Vuadis--

Studious Vuadis: STUDIOUS Vuadis!

Joruf: STUDIOUS Vuadis sent Erend and another Vanguard out at daybreak, to clear the way.

Studious Vuadis: "And so at daybreak--"

Aloy: Hey! Shh. Down the valley, then?

Joruf: Yeah, said they'd check the ruins on the left bank for tracks, take it from there.

Aloy: Okay hear there's a work stoppage. Any way to upgrade my gear?

Joruf: I'll be the smith in Chainscrape. Would let you use his workbench. As for the Bristlebacks, you might want to craft some Acid Arrows. Hitting their canisters with those will take 'em down quick.

Aloy: Thanks. I'll find Erend and I'll bring him back.

[Vuadis tries to sneak into the car.]

Aloy: Hey! Where do you think you're going?

Studious Vuadis: Why, to the top of the ridge, to wait in safety!

Aloy: Sorry, operator's under strict orders. No passengers till the whistle blows, right?

Karhn: That's right! Ha! Best start cranking!

Studious Vuadis: Why! Why..!

Aloy: Joruf, would you kindly escort Studious to Chainscrape and wait for me there?

Joruf: You got it!

Aloy: I will find Erend and I will help clear a path. But after that no more excuses. Barren Light. Embassy.

Studious Vuadis: If such be the will of the Sun…

Aloy: It will be. Trust me.

TO THE BRINK
Aloy: I got to find Erend, but it might be good to hit Chainscrape first and upgrade my bow.

Studious Vuadis: If you'll excuse me. I need to… contemplate.

Joruf: I get us packed up and move us along.

[Descending the mountain trail, Aloy finds a small settlement destroyed by machines.]

Aloy: Those machines must've torn through this camp. This valley definitely isn't safe. 

[She defeats the machines and continues exploring.]

Aloy: I think I can climb up this cliff. I wonder if there's anything interesting at the top?

[She starts climbing.]

Aloy: An old Carja watchtower. I wonder what's inside? Okay. Almost there.

[At the top, she finds a homemade satellite dish.]

Aloy: Some kind of device. The metal reflects the sun… to send a signal? 

[She picks up Lens of Midday.]

Aloy: Looks like some kind of lens. Guess I'll keep it for later.

[She looks around.]

Aloy: I can almost see the entire valley up here. No wonder the Carja built this watchtower.

[She rappels down to the foot of the mountain.]

Aloy: Must be Chainscrape. Joluf said I would get my bow upgraded in there. Might be able to tinker with my other gear, too.

[She encounters a bunch of Scoungers.]

Aloy: If I find where these machines are made I might learn how to override them.

[She defeats them and moves on. She comes across another ruined settlement.]

Aloy: It's a dead machine. It must be a Bristleback. Maybe Erend took it down? Bristlebacks must've got these Oseram. hope Erend and the other Vanguard are okay. Ground's soaked with acid. Did the Bristlebacks do this?

[She crosses the bridge to Chainscrape.]

Oseram Worker: Outlander approaching.

Oseram Worker: Is that the Savior?

Oseram Worker: Want to come in, Savior?

Oseram Worker: Welcome to Chainscrape, Savior.

Aloy: Open up guys. Joruf's orders.

Oseram Worker: That's good enough for me.

[Aloy enters the city and sees a familiar face.]

Petra: By… the forge!

Aloy: Petra?

Petra: Aloy! What are you doing here?

Aloy: Uh--

Petra: About time there was something worth looking at in this dump! It's nice to see you, too. And not a moment too soon! C'mon!

[She drags Aloy with her.]

Aloy: Ah--

Petra: Pah! Damn brewery's the only thing I can count on in this place!

Aloy: Yeah, I heard. Machines, work stoppage.

Petra: Oh, those are just the latest malfunctions! Chainscrape's always been a few tools short of a kit!

Aloy: Right…

Petra: And right there's the biggest tool of all!

Ulvund: Not our land. Not our problem!

Javad the Willing: The Bristlebacks are everybody's problem!

Aloy: Ulvund?

Petra: You've heard of him?

Aloy: Yeah.

Petra: But he's a story best told over a cold beer!

Aloy: Uh, Petra, Petra… I'm just passing through. I'm headed west.

Petra: Oh?

Aloy: There's an Embassy at Barren Light that need to make happen. And then I keep moving.

Petra: Ah, of course. Bigger gears to grind. Well, Flame-hair, good to see you… If you gotta move on.

Aloy: Petra…

Petra: But if you want a cold beer and a few laughs with an old friend, come find me at the brewery. Your choice.

[She leaves. Aloy sighs.]

Aloy: Well this Ulvund guy sounds like trouble. Maybe Petra could use some support. But first things first. I need to find that workbench and upgrade my bow.

[She finds a smithy.]

Hakund: Workbench's free if you need to tinker with that gear of yours.

Aloy: Shop looks closed.

Hakund: Yup.

Aloy: Can still use the workbench?

Hakund: I ain't gonna stop ya.

[Aloy upgrades her gear.]

Aloy: This should be useful. Now just need to find Erend and help him clear the Bristlebacks.

Volma: How am I supposed to work with a hammer in this state?

Hakund: Cool your forge. Till Ulvund blows that whistle, no one's working anyway.

Oseram Worker: Oh! I didn't see you there!

Hakund: Shop's closed, Red. You're welcome to use the workbench. Best I can do.

Oseram Worker: Figures we'd be talking.

Oseram Worker: Red hair. Didn't know I was that honored.

[Aloy walks past Ulvund and Javad overhearing their conversation.]

Javad the Willing: We are on the same side here, Ulvund. The Bristlebacks threaten us all!

Ulvund: Oh drop the act! We all know it was the Carja who let the Bristlebacks into the valley!

Javad the Willing: That is preposterous! Why would we let dangerous machines into our own land?!

Ulvund: You mean the land that honest Oseram laborers work tirelessly with no say in its governance.

Errand: A Dash of Courage (start)
[Aloy enters a tavern. A drunk guy talks to the cook.]

Gilvarn: Hey, Milduf! Milduf! I took some of your stew last time I went into the wilds. Kept me going for a week! Felt like I could a put a Strider in a sleeper hold!

Milduf: Enjoy it while it lasts.

Aloy: Sounds like you're serving up some impressive provisions here.

Milduf: Gah! Not again. You can have the discount too, but you'll have to come back later.

Aloy: I think you have me confused with someone else.

Milduf: Ulvund… didn't send you?

Aloy: No.

Milduf: Oh! My apologies! It's just that his minions won't stop pestering me. And now I've even worn out my special griddle! Since I'm in the midst of a crisis, perhaps you could skip to what it is you wanted?

Aloy: Some of your… food?

Milduf: Of course.

Aloy: Are Ulvund's people causing you problems?

Milduf: Oh, yeah. They constantly demand my best, but the equipment I need to make my signature dishes isn't built for batch cooking. And don't get me started on the "Ulvund discount" they feel so entitled to.

Aloy: And if you refuse?

Milduf: I make meals, not trouble.

Aloy: How did you end up in Chainscrape?

Milduf: Heard about a new and upcoming town at the edge of the frontier. Where there's a town, there's a tavern! And I was in need of work. So. I got myself out here and started cooking. Some of these people had never tasted proper boars and berries stew before! Anyway, next thing I knew, people kept coming back. Guess they liked my food… or the ale.

Aloy: Your last customer mentioned your cooking really kept him going out in the wild. Where I'm headed, I could use some of that.

Milduf: I would be happy to oblige, especially since you have the decency to ask pleasantly…

Aloy: But?

Milduf: But my special grooved griddle is no more! Without it, I can't cook any of my signature dishes. I hate to think what'll happen when I'm forced to refuse Ulvund, or his goons. Even if I already had the right ingredients, there's nothing I can do. Unless you can source me a temporary replacement?

Aloy: What do you need?

Milduf: For the ingredients? A few pieces of decent wild meat and, I'd say a big handful of Bitter Leaf stems. That'll do. As for the griddle, a corrugated metal panel might suffice, until I can have a new one forged. You'd likely find one in a Scrounger pile if you follow the river to the northeast. Don't worry - I'll clean it first! You'll have no issue finding boars and Bitter Leaf on your way, assuming you're as much a hunter-gatherer as your clothing suggests.

Aloy: Thanks, Milduf. I'll keep an eye out.

Milduf: So that's what gratitude sounds like!

Aloy: And don't let anyone push you around, okay?

Milduf: If you say so.

[New errand - A Dash of Courage - is started! Aloy leaves the tavern and finds a heavily injured man.]

Deep Trouble (start)
Aloy: What happened to you?

Amuf: That damned mine is what happened to me… Won't be the last injury if Ulvund keeps shoving his tongs into those tunnels.

Aloy: What mine?

Amuf: Northeast of Chainscrape where the river ends. I told Korvend we should stop when the first cave in happened. But… Ulvund probably threatened to cut off our pay-- or worse…

Aloy: How about you slow down and take me through it? You mentioned you were injured in a cave-in.

Amuf: Yeah, couple of days ago. That's how I hurt this blasted leg. Korvend and the others were opening a new vein while I was checking on an older one. As soon as their blast hit, the tunnel I was in collapsed. Might have dodged it if I wasn't running on barely a spark of sleep. We were pushing too hard and too fast.

Aloy: And you're afraid Korvend and the others might not be as lucky if it happens again?

Amuf: Mm-hmm. Hit the nail right on the head.

Aloy: How come Ulvund's in charge? Don't these mines belong to the Carja?

Amuf: Try telling Ulvund that. He brought in all the backing to get them open, might as well own them. Fire and spit… you ask him, he owns us as well.

Aloy: Who's Korvend?

Amuf: He's our foreman, and a damn good one. The kind that knows how to deal with management when it gets unreasonable. But Ulvund… his demands go beyond unreasonable. Korvend's been doing his best to appease him… He even blamed himself for my injury when it was Ulvund who ordered the extra shifts.

Aloy: Sounds like a good guy.

Amuf: That's why we all put up with the long hours and lousy conditions… But if the whole mine becomes unstable… I'd rather suffer Ulvund's wrath than die buried in rubble.

Aloy: I could check in on your crew if I'm in the area.

Armuf: I… would appreciate that. Thank you.

[New side quest begins - Deep Trouble. Aloy decides to speak with that Ulvund!]

The Bristlebacks (start)
Javad the Willing: What do you want, Ulvund? Some kind of payment?

Ulvund: My dear magistrate, you think I can be bought? If you want that whistle blown, all you have to do is have your soldiers remove the Bristlebacks and sign the concession decree. Face it - what other choice do you have?

Aloy: (clear her throat) Hi.

Javad the Willing: Savior! What auspicious timing. Might we discuss a matter of importance to the Sundom?

Aloy: We might. Later.

Javad the Willing: Very well. I shall be waiting. (leaves)

Ulvund: So… the Savior herself. Walloper of Dervahl, Gutter of Helis!

Aloy: (sighs) Maybe.

Ulvund: I've heard many tales of your beauty and heroics, my fierce lady-warrior! Ulvund Freeholder. At your service. (bows) So, what could have dragged you away from the fine silks and wine of Meridian to this smudge of a settlement? Your Savior-ly attention must be needed elsewhere.

Aloy: I'm here for the Embassy. And--

Ulvund: The Embassy?! Why by the forge-- Ah, greater gears for greater matters. Guess that means you'll be moving on.

Aloy: Once I've dealt with any problems around here that need my… Savior-ly attention.

Ulvund: Ah, the Bristlebacks! Of course. Got to get rid of them if you want that Embassy to take place. Well, best get to it hey? Off you go.

Aloy: Not so fast. You don't seem to have a high opinion of the magistrate.

Ulvund: Well I refuse to play nice to some fancyrobed parchment-pusher when my fellow laborers are being bullied,  intimidated, and taken advantage of.

Aloy: How noble of you.

Ulvund: Noble? Pah! Born with a hammer in hand, I was! Nobody handed me anything or dropped opportunity into my lap!

Ulvund: Everything I've achieved, I've done on my own!

Aloy: And where is this hammer now?

Ulvund: The uh, burden of leadership forced me to set it aside. The Carja risk nothing while demanding that good Oseram gamble with their lives out there. Someone had to step up and say “no more!”

Aloy: You ordered the work stoppage?

Ulvund: Indeed I did. We're laborers, not soldiers. Until the Carja clean up their mess and give us the fair deal we deserve, I'm not risking Oseram lives.

Aloy: “Fair deal” - you mean your concession decree.

Ulvund: It's not my decree. It’s on behalf of all the good Oseram laborers of this land who do all the back-breaking work while only the Carja reap the rewards. All we're asking for is the ability to share in this prosperity for a land worked by the people for the people.

Aloy: Right. And just how much would be your share?

Ulvund: Only an amount appropriate to my contributions to this community, of course.

Aloy: If Chainscrape is on Carja land, shouldn't a Carja be in charge? Who appointed you?

Ulvand: The sensibilities of good Oseram folk, of course! You think a Carja can head this whole venture? Hah! The magistrate can barely make the trek from Barren Light without losing a few screws!

Aloy: So you have no real authority, then. People only follow you because you say so. Loudly.

Ulvund: Anyone who has followers has authority. I've been with Chainscape from the beginning. I mean, I'm practically its founder - and its honest folk know I'm indispensable to its success.

Aloy: You said you founded Chainscrape? Somehow, I doubt that.

Ulvund: “Practically founded” I said. I alone saw its potential when it was just a smattering of tents in Barren Light's shadow. I invested in the mine, convinced some friends back home to do the same, and here we are. You could say Chainscrape is what it is thanks to me.

Aloy: Oh, so you're not just standing around and profiting off everyone else?

Ulvund: Not at all! Sure, I make a little return on my investment here and there, but my main priority, as it was from the beginning, is to look after the wellbeing of these honest working Oseram.

Aloy: Where's the whistle?

Ulvund: Right in the middle of town. But with the threat out there, I'm not endangering innocent Oseram lives.

Aloy: I'm going to clear out the Bristlebacks. And when I'm done this valley is going to get moving.

Ulvund: If that's what it takes. Until then I’ll keep looking after the safety of these good folk.

Aloy: Just be ready to blow the whistle.

[New side quest begins - The Bristlebacks.]

Aloy: Better see what that Carja magistrate wanted. I bet he's in the tavern.

[She runs past a fighting pit.]

Odurg: You look like you're itching for a fight friend!

Aloy: You wanted to speak to me?

Odurg: Well, you know better than anyone it's a dangerous world out there. And not just against machines! Name's Odurg. This here's my training pit. Best place to practice close combat this side of the Forbidden West! Say, wonder who'd win in a fight - you, the Savior of Meridian, Champion of the East, or The Enduring. Master of the West?

Aloy: Who?

Odurg: The Enduring! A legendary Tenakth fighter. The Master of Masters. I've heard the Tenakth have training pits just like this one. It's how their warriors get so fierce, see. And only the very best from the pits get to train with The Enduring.

Aloy: So to find The Enduring, I should look for these training pits if I'm ever out that way.

Odurg: You'll have to go far if you do. The Tenakth are split into three clans. Three clans, three capitals. three training pits. My guess is you'd have to beat all of them if you want to train with The Enduring. If the Tenakth don't kill you on sight, that is. But that's a far spark in the wind. As for right now… I also offer challenges to test your fighting skill.

Aloy: Who would I be fighting, exactly? You?

Odurg: Well, I know you're the Savior and all but you'll have to beat all the others first to challenge me. Rules are rules! We only use dull blades and practice arrows, mind. These drunken fools would run themselves through otherwise. You'll have to leave everything but your spear and practice arrows at the gate. But I'll look after your gear not to worry! So, what do you say? Up for some training? (laughs)

Aloy: I might be.

Odurg: That's what like to hear!

[First fight in Melee Pit - Resonator Blast - begins!]

Odurg: That energy doesn't last forever. That spear can give you the edge in battle. Keep energizing it and then your enemies. Triggering those energy blasts should help you vanquish your opponents.

To The Brink (continue)
[After winning the contest, Aloy decides to leave the city and find Erend.]

Aloy: Was that a Tripwire? Whole area's rigged with them.

[She finds an Oseram trapped by the machines.]

Aloy: It's always something. Hold tight! I'll see what can do!

Thurlis: Try luring them into the Tripwires!

Aloy: Spotted. Gotta move.

[Aloy lures the machines into traps. After electrocuting them, they shut down for a minute and she destroys them with her spear.]

Thurlis: Aw, why kill it like that? What do you think the Tripwires’re for? Okay fine! Kill 'em however you want! Tripwires are better though.

Aloy: Stunned - got an opening! That's the last one.

Thurlis: Phew! Hello, Red! What a day, what a day.

Thurlis: Thank the forge you showed up. Tripwire's handy, but machine hunting's a young'n's game. Come on over. Let me give thanks proper like. I see you're a practiced hunter. Took you less time to kill those Scroungers than Vanguards to kill one Bristleback!

Aloy: So the Vanguards came through here?

Thurlis: Yeah, just a bit ago. Took down that Bristleback, headed south. But then those Scroungers showed up to carve the carcass, as they do. Then another Bristleback ran through! I'm telling you, it's crazy around here!

Aloy: So the Vanguard went south.

Thurlis: Probably. This whole valley is swarming with them. The Vanguard seemed dead-set on getting rid of them.

Aloy: I see.

Thurlis: Hold on there, Red! If you're gonna go chasing cross the Daunt, you're gonna want a Tripcaster. And not just any Tripcaster. One of my make. Free of charge.

Aloy: Workmanship looks solid enough.

Thurlis: Yup. Been tweaking the design since I left Chainscrape. More room to tinker out here. And less chance of… well accidents.

Aloy: Did something happen in Chainscrape?

Thurlis: Hmph. More like “someone.”

Aloy: Let me guess: Ulvund.

Thurlis: Back when I had a place in town, he took a real interest in my wares. Kept pressing for the "Ulvund discount." I said no. He didn't like that so much. I can't prove it, but that chuft bucket set my workshop on fire. Felt it best to put some distance between us after that.

Aloy: Cable car operator told me the Bristlebacks just appeared yesterday. Do you know anything about them?

Thurlis: How is ol' Karhn? Back in the day me and him got into all sorts of trouble. There was this one time-- 

Aloy: Anything about the Bristlebacks?

Thurlis: Lucky for me I've got you and the Vanguards swooping in time to time to save my backside.

Aloy: I should get going. Thanks for the Tripcaster.

Thurlis: While you're blasting Bristlebacks, I think I'll head down to the Hunting Grounds. Did you know they have a Tripcaster Trial? Come by later if you want to try it out.

Aloy: Maybe. After I get things under control. 

[She continues her searches.]

Aloy: So Erend headed south. Should be able to pick up his tracks with my Focus.

[She finds some fresh tracks.]

Aloy: There's tracks… headed up the hill. Erend's? My Focus can help me follow them. Let's see where this leads.

[She finds a destroyed bridge along the way. Soon she finds Erend fiercely fighting a few machines using a hammer. Aloy smiles.]

Aloy: Sounds like someone's putting up a fight.

Aldur: Another one down!

Erend: Now this? This is what I was forged for! (continues fighting) No ledgers to fill. No boring mid-afternoon patrols. (wins) Just the hammer! Just the fight! Aloy?

Aloy: Erend!

[Erend is distracted and one of the Bristlebacks knocks him down. The monster turns around to deliver the final blow. Erend reaches for the hammer, gets to his feet, and… retreats, climbing up the dilapidated building with the help of his warrior. As it appears his ribs were broken.]

Aloy: Stay where you are! I'll handle the rest!

Erend: Dammit, I should be down there--

Aldur: Not with those ribs.

Aloy: Those Bristlebacks have Acid canisters on their backs. It should trigger a chain reaction if I hit them with Acid Arrows. Machine's tough. Acid's no use here.

Erend: Turn 'em to scrap, Aloy! Ha! That one hurt. 

[Aloy defeats two monstrous Bristlebacks and goes to Erend who holds to his wounded side.]

Erend: Caught me at my best. As usual.

Aloy: Well, you did the hard part just took care of the stragglers. How bad is it?

Erend: This? Who needs ribs? I'm good. I'm good. Okay, well I… I know you didn't come all the way to the Daunt just to watch me get wrecked. So what's the story?

Aloy: I need the Embassy to happen. So I can head west. Erend, what I did at the Spire… what we did… it didn't end the threat. It just slowed it down There's still more to do.

Erend: Really? Well, that's great! I mean… not the “threat's not over” part, that's… not so great. But hey, whatever you're up against… Your spear? My hammer? Just like old times!

Aloy: (sighs) Erend, I need the Embassy now. I can't wait for you to heal.

Erend: Couple days' rest. If that.

Aloy: Actually… even if you weren't hurt, what have to do… it's better if I do it alone.

Erend: Alone. That figures.

Aldur: Erend. I hate to interrupt the romance, but I'm pretty banged up here.

Erend: Don't blow your blaze. I'm coming! Ugh, this just keeps getting better. Listen. I go to Barren Light, get patched up. If you want this Embassy to happen, we're going to need this Sun-Priest, Studious Vuadis--

Aloy: Oh, I know him. I'll clear the valley of Bristlebacks, then send Vuadis to Barren Light. I'll catch up with you there.

Erend: Well, I guess that's sort of like a “goodbye.”

Aloy: I'm sorry?

Erend: You? Sorry? (smirks) That'd be a first.

Aloy: Where is this coming from?

Erend: Hey just… you know, forget it, yeah? It's nothing.

Aloy: It sounds like something.

Erend: All right, fine. Now, after the battle at the Spire, when you took off? You left without so much as a handshake! I mean, people like me, we fought and bled at your side, Aloy, and you just… disappear? What kind of person does that?

Aloy: Erend, I left when I did, how did, for a reason. A good one.

Erend: Oh, thanks for sharing!

Aloy: Listen to me. Life on Earth is in danger and only I can save it.

Erend: What are you talking about?

Aloy: Exactly what I just said. Everything living is going to die unless I… …fix a piece of technology created by the Old Ones. And time's running out.

Erend: Well, I guess that's a reason, all right. Ugh. I'm an idiot.

Aldur: Erend! By the forge!

Erend: I guess that's my cue.

Aloy: Maybe I should go with you to Barren Light.

Erend: No, hey, you're needed elsewhere, obviously. We'll make it without you.

[From afar, there is a great rumbling sound, like an explosion.]

Aloy: That doesn't sound good.

Erend: You'll have to handle that one on your own. We'll only slow you down. I said we're good. Aloy. You go on ahead.

Aldur: What are you standing around for, then? Help me off this thing.

[Aloy runs in the direction from which the rumbling sound came.]

Aloy: I can't override that machine. But I could learn, if there's a Cauldron out here.

[She finds an ancient ruin.]

Aloy: It's a run from the Old World. Bet I could find something interesting inside. Okay. What do we have in here? 

[She sees a woman warrior fighting a Bristleback.]

Aloy: It'll be slow going if I use Acid on it.

[Together they defeat the machine.]

Telga: Is that the Savior of Meridian?!

Aloy: Glad I can help.

Telga: You have my thanks, Savior. But I could still use a hand freeing my friend.

Aloy: Let's do it.

[They help the warrior get back on his feet.]

Fendur: Mighty thankful to you, Savior.

Aloy: Just Aloy is fine.

Telga: Erend mentioned you're not one for fancy titles.

Aloy: You're Vanguard.

Fendur: Here to escort Vuadis' delicate behind to the Embassy.

Telga: If we can get rid of these Bristlebacks.

Fendur: Captain said to keep an eye on Chainscape. Then these ugly lugs showed up. 

Telga: Gave the first one a good beating.

Fendur: But didn't quite have time to roll outta the way when it fell.

Telga: Told you it wasn't a good idea to eat that much before heading out.

Aloy: I should probably get going.

Fendur: Now, if you see any more of these Bristlebacks--

Aloy: I'll make sure to roll out of their way.

Telga: Might want to take some of these with you as well. (gives Aloy 2 Smoke Bomb) They're handy in a pinch.

Aloy: Thanks.

Telga: Stay safe, Aloy.

[Aloy continues her searches.]

Aloy: Think that metal tower's giving off the signal I could head over there, check it out.

[She finds a Vista Point for The Daunt.]

Alog: An image from the Old World. Looks like some kind of building in front of sheer cuffs. The image is incomplete… but maybe if ime it up exactly with where it was taken my Focus can fill in the rest. There's the quarry Thurlis mentioned. And it's full of Bristlebacks.

[She helps a few workers fight the Fire Bristlebacks.]

Belna: That's it. Smash 'em to scrap!

Aloy: One less machine.

Belna: Those acid-spitters brought friends.

Aloy: Incoming! Another one down. One less machine. I think I'm out of range of the Vista Point. I gotta try again.

Belna: That's it. Smash ‘em to scrap!

Aloy: Another one down. Shocked and locked!

Belna: Ha ha! Look at that thing drop!

Aloy: There. Quarry's safe.

Belna: Stranger, come on over here. We gotta talk. Over here girl. I wanna thank you. I dunno what a Nora is doin' out here, but consider yourself owed. We tried to hold off and wait for the Vanguard, but one of them Bristlebacks charged us. Next thing you know, it was a full-fledged fracas!

Aloy: Is everyone okay?

Belna: We lost some good people. But we would've lost the whole quarry without you.

Aloy: Well at least it's quiet now.

Belna: Your ears oughta be ringin’ with a quarry at work! But Chainscrape's whistle ain't blowin’, so we're stuck pickin' up the pieces.

Aloy: You need the whistle to get back to work?

Belna: Me and my crew, we're just little cogs out here. Can't lift a hammer till Ulvund blows that thing. 'Cause if we work without his say-so, he'll ban us. And my people have been through enough.

Aloy: Ulvund holds that much power?

Belna: He's got the money and connections to snuff our fires for good. Almost feels like we stood a better chance with the Bristlebacks.

Aloy: What are you and your crew working on?

Belna: We're supposed to be working Ulvund's claim, diggin' out stone to shore up Barren Light. But the work stoppage and the Bristlebacks cut us short. Never seen those blasted things in the Daunt before. Where in forge fire did they come from?

Aloy: I'm not sure. At least not yet. I need to get going. Stay safe.

Belna: Thanks to you, that might actually be possible today.

Aloy: I think I've cleared out most of the Bristlebacks. Chainscrape can get back to work now. I'll go give Ulvund the good news. Vuadis, too. Then maybe this Embassy can finally happen.

[But first she decides to look around.]

Aloy: I could look around with my Focus, try to match the Vista Point image. It looks like the building in the image might’ve been near a river. Maybe there used to be a bridge nearby? The ruins of a bridge. Maybe it's the same one from the image? I could try to line it up around here. There it is! Huh. Completing the image unlocked a data file. It looks like these Vista Points were made by… Miriam Technologies. That was Elisabet’s company. I wonder if I can find more of them out in the wilds. 

[She moves on.]

Aloy: It's a ruin from the Old World. Bet I could find something interesting inside. Okay. What do we have in here? Looks like this door needs some kind of key module. Maybe there's one in the ruins. Some data survived. There's a code for the locked door in this data. But I still need to find a key module. A crate. This should be useful. It's not hooking on to that. Okay. Got to find a key for the door. There's more of the ruin down here. Where to now? Whoa! Well I can't reach the ledge above now. Guess I'll have to find another way up. There. A little more light down here. Down it goes. Okay. Now where doces lead? Ah-ha. A key module. An Old World relic. How do I get in there to get it? Okay Let's see if this key fits. There. Looks like this needs a code, too. I think some of the data I picked up might help. Got it! Huh. What is this thing? I'll hold on to it for now. Figure out what to do with it later.

[She travels to Chainscrape.]

Aloy: Time to get Ulvund to blow the whistle. Then Vuadis to Barren Light.

Oseram Worker: Hello.

[She pays a visit to Ulvund.]

Ulvund: Still here, I see.

Aloy: I cleared out all the Bristlebacks.

Ulvund: Oh, you did?

Aloy: Now that you've recovered from your shock, time to blow the whistle.

Ulvund: Whoa there, not so fast! I'll have to send someone out to confirm the kills, make sure the valley is safe again. Shouldn't take more than a day… or two…

Aloy: No. You blow the whistle now.

Ulvund: These are innocent Oseram lives we're talking about here. Surely the delay--

Aloy: Either you do it now, or I will.

Ulvund: (changes attitude) I knew you could do it! Friends, gather round! The Savior of Meridian has done it again - the Bristlebacks are defeated! You!

Oseram Worker: Wha…?

Ulvund: Sound the whistle! Chainscrape is open for business!

Aloy: And Ulvund has agreed to personally pay every worker their lost wages!

Oseram Worker: That's more like it!

Oseram Worker: Yeah!

Oseram Worker: Woo.

Oseram Worker: Ha ha!

Ulvund: Don't you have an Embassy to get to?

Aloy: Yeah. I guess I do.

[She walks away.]

Aloy: Now that Chainscrape's back to work merchants should be open to trade. I should see if they have anything useful before I send Vuadis off to Barren Light. Better see what that Carja magistrate wanted. I bet he's in the tavern.

Volma: 'Bout time that whistle blew.

Hakund: Ulvund must be thrilled. Brought out only the good stuff for you, Red. Seeing as you got that whistle blowing.

Volma: Hey! I've been waiting to get my lucky hammer fixed for days!

Hakund: You haven't done anything useful like getting rid of any Bristlebacks, though, have you? Take your time. I promise you won't be disappointed.

[Aloy buys and sells stuff.]

Hakund: Come back anytime.

Volma: Now, can I get this fixed?

Hakund: I can fix your tools, 'fraid there's no fixing you.

[Aloy returns to Vuadis.]

Aloy: The way to Barren Light is clear. Get moving.

Studious Vuadis: You're not Erend Vanguardsman! I will move only when the captain says--

Aloy: (losing patience) When I have cleared out all the Bristlebacks, which I have. Captain's orders.

Joruf: So, they're okay?

Aloy: Banged up but breathing. And waiting up ahead for you.

Studious Vuadis: But… But I-I was supposed to have three escorts--

Joruf: I'm off to Barren Light Vuadis. Like Aloy said - Captain's orders. You can stay here…

Studious Vuadis: Abandoned to the riff raff? I think not!

Joruf: Guess you're coming with me, then. See you there, Aloy! (leaves with the cart)

THE EMBASSY
Aloy: Well now that that's done the Embassy can finally get underway. If I can get through it, I'll be able to track down Sylens. HADES. Maybe even a GAIA backup. Guess I could head straight for Barren Light. Or poke around the Daunt some more first. And maybe take Petra up on that drink.

[She goes to the tavern and approaches Javad who is working on a document under one of the tables.]

Javad the Willing: Ah, Savior, over here! Savior. Thank you for taking the time. And my condolences that you had to endure Ulvund's bloviating.

Aloy: I've dealt with worse. It sounds like he's really trying to put you over the barrel.

Javad the Willing: The idea that the Carja purposely let Bristlebacks into the Daunt-pft! It's completely absurd. But the louder and longer he says it, the more support he'll get for his damned concession decree.

Aloy: How did the Bristlebacks get into the Daunt?

Javad the Willing: No one knows for sure. The first report of them came from west of the quarry. But unless they have wings I don't know about. I don't see how they could have come over the mountains.

Aloy: No other way in?

Javad the Willing: The only way I know about is Barren Light… Look, if you can get to the bottom of this I can offer a considerable bounty in return. Help me shut Ulvund up.

Aloy: What is this concession decree that Ulvund wants?

Javad the Willing: He wants the Sundom to designate portions of the Daunt as Oseram holdings - only the portions, mind you, that produce any value.

Aloy: Let me guess - because he stands to profit somehow.

Javad the Willing: Exactly. With the Daunt under Oseram law, he could secure more investment for their numerous ventures.

Aloy: He can't get those investments without the concession?

Javad the Willing: No, not while there's a chance the Sundom could revoke their access. Hence why the concession is so important to him. And why blaming the Carja for the Bristlebacks, no matter how absurd, works in his favor.

Aloy: How did you get stuck out here?

Javad the Willing: I asked for the posting, believe it or not. Overseeing the entire valley on behalf of the Sun-King? It was an honor. Is an honor, I mean.

Aloy: But your job would be a lot easier without someone like Ulvund blasting hot air all the time.

Javad the Willing: Ulvund's not going anywhere. He's been around longer than I have, even fancies himself the founder of Chainscrape. I'll find a way to live with him. I have to.

Aloy: How does blaming the Carja for the Bristlebacks help Ulvund get his concession?

Javad the Willing: Look around. This may be the Sundom, but Chainscrape is all gears, rust, and bad ale. Claiming that the Carja loosed the Bristlebacks in order to intimidate Oseram laborers into obedience… Well, let's just say no one here has forgotten the atrocities of the Mad Sun-King. Even with the valley working again, Ulvund hopes he can stir up enough resentment against the Carja to call for a strike.

Aloy: And if the Oseram refuse to work unless the concession is signed, you won't have a choice.

Javad the Willing: Correct. The reconstruction of Barren Light must continue.

Aloy: You said the Bristlebacks were first spotted west of the quarry?

Javad the Willing: Yes, according to one terrified laborer. Said the ground trembled before they came charging down the hillside. He took off and ran all the way here.

Aloy: Good place to start looking, then.

Javad the Willing: If you learn the truth, maybe Ulvund will stop blaming the Carja for every problem under the sun. And maybe then he'll actually focus on rebuilding Barren Light instead.

[Aloy bids Javad farewell and looks around the tavern. She spot a young woman playing a board game by herself.]

Salma: Hey, Red. Fancy a game of Strike? Ah! Come to revel in some Strike, sister? Let me set the board.

Aloy: I was just passing by--

Salma: First timer, huh? Don't worry about it. I'll go easy on you. You got any pieces?

Aloy: Uh, no.

Salma: Well, aren't you in luck then? I got an extra set, a Tenakth original, straight outta the Forbidden West. Sit! Sit, sit, sit! I'll run you through it in a hot spark. I'll give you something special if you win at all my boards, too!

[Defeated by the girl's pressure, Aloy sits down at the table.]

Salma: All right. Let's start off simple. The Tenakth like to say that Machine Strike is a game of pure strategy. We each get a set of pieces. Each piece represents a kind of machine, and each machine is worth a different number of Victory Points. To win the game, you'll need to gain seven Victory Points by destroying the opponent's machines. It can be tricky remembering the details of every machine, so we use these Notes to keep track of 'em. You see that number on the top right corner? That there's how many Victory Points you'll get for destroying that machine. Notes also tell ya how far a piece can move-- How powerful their attacks are-- The distance they can strike from-- And, of course, their Health. That's enough for now. Let's just play! I'll explain the rest as we go. I own the board, so I get to choose who goes first. Since this is your first time, I'll let you go! Usually, you get to choose which pieces to set on the board, but this will do for now. Pick up that machine piece to your right and move it forward. Remember, each machine can only move a certain distance. Take a look at your Notes if you need a reminder.

[Aloy makes her first move.]

Salma: Easy enough, huh? Now, you get to move two machines each round, so go ahead and pick a second machine. Perfect. There's not much else to do for now, so just end your turn. We're forging onwards! Let me move my pieces here… And we're back to you. This time, why don't you try attacking one of my pieces? Try with that machine on your right first. Now move the piece close enough to attack one of my machines. When performing an attack, you'll be testing your machine's Combat Power against the opponent's. A machine's Combat Power is a combination of the terrain your machine is standing on and its own Attack Power. This board only has Grassland terrain, which has no effect on a machine's Combat Power. And your current machine has two points of Attack Power. So in total, your machine's combat power equals two points. Since my machine isn't the one attacking, it has zero points of Attack Power. And just like your machine, it's not affected by Grassland terrain. So right now, the difference in Combat Power between the two machines is two points. This means your machine can do two points of damage to my machine. Did you get all that? Knew you were a smart one. Finish up by attacking my machine. Not pulling any punches, huh? Now grab that second machine of yours. See how your machine can't move close enough to attack mine? You can make your machine Sprint. That lets it move one space further. Try it out. Downside to Sprinting is that your machine can no longer attack. Now, some players like to take a risk and Overcharge their machine in cases like this. Overcharging lets you attack after a Sprint, but it will damage your machine's Health by two points. So, use at your own discretion. Let's try doing that now, so you can see what I mean. That's about it for your turn, then. Now, I'll let you in on a neat trick. That machine of yours, the one closest to me… grab a hold of it. Same as in the wilds, machines have both Armored Points and Weak Points. You can see 'em marked on the pieces. Blue shows where their armor is thickest. Hit 'em there and you'll do some damage, but not a lot. Now, red shows a machine's Weak Points. Hit those and you'll deal a mighty blow! Here, let me show you. Rotate that piece so your machine faces mine. Now let that machine have it. Off the board she goes! And there's your first Victory Points! You don't have seven of 'em yet, so let's keep going. Your machine attacked mine, but hasn't moved yet. Go ahead and move downwards towards my remaining piece. You've already attacked a machine and moved your piece. But… If you Overcharge your machine, you can attack a second time. And by the look of your machine's Health, you'd be sacrificing your piece to defeat mine. But sometimes, that can be a good thing. Overcharge your machine to attack mine a second time and I'll show you what I mean. Ain't that a thrill? Now, because your machine was knocked out at the same time as mine, we both get the Victory Points our machines are worth. Good news is, since you're the one attacking you're gonna receive your Victory Points before I do. Which means you can reach the coveted seven Victory Points first. That's why sometimes losing a piece can be the best way to end a game in your favor. Now, you'll notice you didn't get quite up to seven Victory Points this time, but you did destroy all my pieces. That means you're the winner! That wasn't so hard, was it? Just remember to always check for the best terrain to attack from. You'd be surprised the advantage you can gain over an opponent like that. I know it's saved my behind in a game or two.

Aloy: I'll try and remember that.

Salma: Oh! Before I forget… These are all my spare pieces. I want the Savior of Meridian to have 'em. It's a small set to be sure, but it should be enough to get you in on any Strike games you find out there. You might even fancy looking out for them Strike Carvers. They've got all kinds of unique pieces that can turn a game in your favor. Though they'll need the right materials to craft you one. Or you might find them in the wilds if you’re lucky. I know I've lost my fair share of pieces after a a night of machine hunting. Or brew hopping. No need to thank me. Always a pleasure to help out new Strike players. Now, if you feel like playing a real game. I've got plenty of other boards. I could even teach you a few more tricks if you're up for it.

Aloy: Thanks. I'll think about it.

Salma: I'll see you later, Aloy.

[New Errand completed - Learning Machine Strike. Having received a lot of important and necessary information, Aloy decides to get drunk. She finds Petra sitting in the same tavern drinking beer.]

The Twilight Path (start)
Petra: Come for that beer after all, eh? Here, sit down! Get a pint in her hand! Wasn't expecting you to swing by…

Aloy: Since when do I do what's expected?

Petra: Hah! There's that spark! Fire and spit!

[The two men sitting next to her stand up and raise their mugs.]

Aloy: Uh… Fire and spit…

Petra: Ahhh. That's a blast from the bellows. Won't fix the forge, but at least I can forget about my troubles for a while.

Aloy: Like what?

Petra: Well, things aren't as bad since you got this place running again. But… we still got Ulvand grating the gears about his concession decree. 

[She gets up and yells at the guy playing with the knife.]

Petra: If you don't put that down. I'll come over there and show you how that game ends. Anyway, right now, I'm just worried about those refugees out from Sunfall. To come all this way, enduring forge knows what…

Aloy: Shadow Carja refugees? What are they doing in the Daunt?

Petra: Looking for a new home, I gather. They're camped out by an old trailhead southwest of here. And therein lies the problem… A Stormbird crashed up on the cliffs last week, and Tolland Cleanbroker's had his eye on the salvage ever since. But the refugees’ve barred entrance. Musn't interrupt their sun-scorched ritual, something about finding a “twilight path.”

Aloy: Huh… never heard them talk about that before.

Petra: Yeah, well, these particular Shadow Carja are an odd bunch. But overall, they're peaceful folk. Not that it matters to Tolland. He'll crack some heads to get to that salvage. Maybe you could swing by, convince 'em to set up camp somewhere else?

Aloy: So, the Bristlebacks in the Daunt… Where did they come from?

Petra: That's the thing. No one rightly knows. They just showed up one day, rampaging around the valley like they exploded out of a forge. Lost some good people. But bless the bellows you cleared them out and got this place working again. That put a dent in Ulvund's plans. Now, if only there were some way to smash ‘em altogether and run him out of town.

Aloy: But how could Bristlebacks in the Daunt help Ulvund?

Petra: Two words: concession decree. Since no one knows where the Bristlebacks came from, Ulvund has taken to blaming the Carja for 'em. He's hoping to dig up enough old resentments to get a strike going until the concession's signed. He's been trying to rile up the workers since the day he rolled into town.

Aloy: And people actually believe him?

Petra: Lots of folks suffered at the hands of the Mad King during the Red Raids. Give 'em half a reason, they'll blame the Carja for anything.

Aluf: Damn Carja slavers!

Aloy: I thought you'd be back in Free Heap. 

Petra: Well, after the big battle at Meridian I went back. But realized it was running smooth, didn't need me. Heard about the rebuilding out at Barren Light, figured they could use another hammer. Been scrapin’ by ever since.

Aloy: You could always leave…?

Petra: And go back east? Nah. I ain't one to leave a lit forge. Besides, someone's gotta be a squeaky wheel for the workers around here.

Aloy: What else can you tell me about the Shadow Carja refugees?

Petra: Well, they don't call themselves "Shadow Carja," for one. At least, not anymore. They're some other brand of sun-crazed. But whatever side of the sun they're on, they're peaceful, through and through. Don't seem to want for nothing 'cept place to live, pray, and just enough food to keep from starving.

Aloy: So, they're just camped outside by a trail, blocking entry to a wrecked Stormbird, waiting for… what exactly?

Petra: Don't rightly know. But I'll tell you this: Should they ever wise up and salvage it… a Stormbird heart is worth a lot. And if they get there first, then by Oseram law, it's theirs. Not that Tolland Cleanbroker's ever lost sleep over any law-breaking.

Aloy: Who is this Tolland Cleanbroker?

Petra: Just some chuff-huffing pawnsman, got a shop here in town. Lived in Chainscrape since there was a Chainscrape. He and Ulvund go back a ways. Like a pair of coals in a campfire, those two.

Aloy: So, Tolland works for Ulvund?

Petra: Hah! Ulvund might think so. but Tolland scrapes up his own scams. And he ain't the type to let a few refugees get between him and Stormbird salvage.

Aloy: So, about Ulvund…

Petra: Around here, everything's about Ulvund.

Aloy: How'd he end up in charge?

Petra: He got here early, Like a squirrel smelling a fatinut. He knew rebuilding Barren Light would need stone and timber… …so he angled purses all over Mainspring getting investors to front claims on anything in the Daunt that might be worth a damn. Thing is, all the bankers back home know that this is Carja land and the Sun-King can revoke those claims at any time. That's why he's desperate for the magistrate to sign off on a concession decree.

Aloy: Well, if I'm up that way, I'll talk to the refugees. Try to convince them to move.

Petra: Much appreciated. They have it rough. Don't need Tolland making it rougher.

[New Side Quest - The Twilight Path.]

Aloy: Petra said Tolland has a shop here in Chainscrape. I could have a word with him first.

[She decides to pay Tolland a visit.]

Tolland Cleanbroker: It's you. The machine hunter that bailed out the Carja.

Aloy: Never heard it put that way before.

Tolland Cleanbroker: What do you want?

Aloy: Heard you've been hassling refugees up by the cliffs.

Tolland Cleanbroker: Yeah, well, you heard wrong. There's salvage up there - a Stormbird. Nailed it myself with the harpoon here in town. Not an easy shot if I do say so myself. Clipped its wing, and it crashed into the old tower up there killed it quick. So, if anyone's hassling anyone, it's the Shadow Carja filth that's blocking the way up to my claim!

Aloy: And you're ready to crack some skulls to get to it?

Tolland Cleanbroker: No need. It's a raggedy bunch. They'll probably all starve before I have to lift a finger.

Aloy: We'll see about that.

Tolland Cleanbroker: Oh yeah, we will, won't we? Now, shop's closed to Carja-lovers. On your blasted way.

Errand: A Bigger Boom (start)
[Aloy leaves the city and finds a stall near the gates.]

Delah: (flattering) I'm sorry, I will be right with you.

Aloy: Uh--

Delah: Okay, I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm saying it's overkill.

Boomer: It's a weapon! "Kill" is the point.

Delah: Not if it blows the user’s arm off! Just… just stop talking! (flattering) Where were we? Ah! So, uh, you! You look like someone who's always searching for a new weapon, am I right?

Aloy: Actually, I--

[Boomer's new invention explodes.]

Delah: Could you just NOT?! I am with a customer!

Aloy: …I'm not a customer.

Boomer: I got it! TRIPLE the powder, it'll blow a Strider sky-high! Ba-BOOM! One shot kill, guaranteed!

Aloy: Maybe I am.

Delah: Then you are in the right place at the right time, Red! How would you like to be the proud owner of the world's first machine enhanced--

Boomer: --explosive done-in-one machine-wrecking--

Delah: --yet perfectly safe javelin thrower?

Aloy: Are you two from around here?

Delah: Nah, the Claim. Dad sent us out west in search of some unknown "opportunity." Said we'll know it when we see it.

Aloy: Sounds like you had other ideas.

Delah: Let's just say that opening another trading post for my parents isn't how I want to make my mark in this world. (sighs) I imagine traveling alone must be nice.

Aloy: So, she's your partner?

Delah: My "apprentice." And my sister. She's why we're out here. There was an incident. ANOTHER incident.

Aloy: Involving explosives?

Boomer: Ba-boom!

Delah: And Dad's precious homebrew. He shipped us out the next day.

Aloy: Huh. Tell me more about this weapon of yours.

Delah: Saw a scroll when I was a kid, by some Carja scholar who wandered out west. Had a scary drawing of a Tenakth warrior hunting with a kind of… javelin thrower. Effective? Yes. Basic? Undoubtedly. But coming out here made me remember it, and I am on the brink of vastly improving the tool's archaic design.

Boomer: Whereas I will PERFECT it!

Delah: I can use machine parts to enhance the user's throw. Increase the projectile's velocity. While Boomer here is adamant that enhancing the projectile is better. Namely with explosive tips.

Boomer: Boom sticks!

Aloy: Why not both?

Delah: That… could work. There's one small snag. I need the parts to make the first working model.

Delah: For starters. I'll need--

Boomer: Charger Horns! Intact!

Delah: Yeah, that. Just be sure to shoot 'em off before the machine goes down. Otherwise they break. But the real innovation, and keep it to yourself, is a Fanghorn Rib.

Boomer: There's a mean one east of here. Blow it sky high.

Delah: Boomer! You get 'em for me, it's yours, my treat.

Aloy: You have a deal.

[New Errand - A Bigger Boom.]

Aloy: I could get around faster if I find a Charger to override. I can override one of these chargers. Have to go in quiet so I don't spook the herd. Can’t override that now. Need to get data from a Cauldron, if I can find one.

[She's trying to get the horns.]

Aloy: Didn't shoot off the Horns. Have to try again. Gotta shoot off the Homs before it goes down. If the Charger goes down, its Horns break. I gotta try again. I should have enough Charger Horns for Delah and Boomer now. Just need a rib from that Fanghorn they were talking about. Okay, then. Yah!

Aloy: Barren Light Last part of the Sundom before the Forbidden West. A Carja horn. Maybe that means the Embassy's starting soon. All right, I should find whoever's in charge here. But first I could resupply at my stash. Might be worth taking a look around, too.

Keruf: Is that..? The Savior of Meridian! Can we have a word? Ah. Savior. Tell me. Are you seeking passage into No Man's Land, by any chance?

Aloy: Maybe. Why do you ask?

Keruf: Ah! Well. To hammer it plain, there's treasure out west-unclaimed scrap and ancient metal. And I've got a sturdy band of salvagers that knows the lay of the land.

Aloy: You're not afraid of the Tenakth?

Keruf: Terrified. But I carry out most of my business in No Man's Land. Neutral territory and all that. Barren Light is our port of entry. When its doors aren't closed for an Embassy. I was hoping your arrival meant they might be opening soon? I've got a business to run after all!

Aloy: I want that Embassy to happen as much as you do. Believe me, I'm working on it.

Keruf: Good to know. And keep us in mind! If you do manage to open the way, our main camp will be just past Barren Light. We'll buy any scrap you got on you… …and if you're looking for machine parts, we've got the best in the West guaranteed!

Aloy: All right. Maybe later, then?

Keruf: If you can get those blasted gates open!

Aloy: (to herself) Guess I'm not the only one who wants to get those gates open.

Beginner Strike Player: No one wants to play some Strike? Anyone? Lets play some Machine Strike!

The Embassy (continue)
Aloy: There's Erend. Looks like he's had a few. Gentlemen.

Aldur: That's our cue.

[The soldiers leave.]

Aloy: Taking the edge off?

Erend: If the end of the world's coming I don't wanna be sober for it. Now, lemme guess. You're in a rush, right? So, whatever you need, ask away.

Aloy: How have things been since I--

Erend: Your silent departure? Not bad. Vanguard's going strong. Helped Avad pick up the pieces after the battle with the Eclipse. I took a month to bury Ersa in the Claim. When I got back, I got the assignment to babysit Vuadis on his way to the Embassy. I thought that'd be a cakewalk. So, of course, things went sideways.

Aloy: You got blindsided. Wasn't your fault.

Erend: A couple more of these and maybe I'll believe you.

Aloy: I… was wondering if you were able to lay Ersa to rest like you wanted.

Erend: Uh, yeah we did should have seen the crowd that showed up to pay their respects. Half of ‘em owed her a favor. And the other half owed her their lives. In the end everybody drank, you know. That's the rowdiest funeral since well, since ever.

Aloy: Feels like she would have liked that.

Erend: Yeah, damn straight. Damn straight. She would've put 'em all under the table.

Aloy: What do you know about the Embassy?

Erend: Not much. Only that Avad really wants it to happen. He's set on making peace with these… Tenakth. But, from what hear they're not too big on the whole diplomacy thing. They do most of their talking with blades and arrows. So, if you’re heading their way, be prepared. Things might get ağly real fast.

Aloy: I'll keep that in mind. What do you know about this place!

Erend: Nothing good. It was where the Carja dragged all the captives they took from the Forbidden West during the Red Raids. The lucky ones became slave labor. The rest were hauled off to the Sun-Ring in Meridian.

Aloy: For sacrifice.

Erend: You got it. The Tenakth made sure to wreck the place before they chased the Carja out of the west. I can't say I blame them. Now Avad's paying the Oseram to rebuild it. But no matter how much new store they put up, it'll still be stained in blood.

Aloy: I better get going.

Erend: Right. Off to do complicated "Aloy" things. Maybe just don't disappear completely this time?

Aloy: No promises.

Erend: …I guess what I'm really trying to say is, if you ever do need me…

Aloy: I know where to find you. Hopefully, sober next time.

Erend: Don't count on it. Be careful out there, Aloy.

[Aloy decides to go to the gate. There she finds two guards and their commander, apperently.]

Lawan: Lighten up. Payiv. You've got a thick wall of stone between you and the Tenakth out there.

Carja Guard: Yes, sir.

Aloy: Are you in charge around here?

Lawan: An, apologies no. That would be Commander Nozar. I'm Lawan, his second-in command. So, what brings Aloy of the Nora to Barren Light?

Aloy: I'm here for the Embassy. I need it to happen so I can head west. And maybe now that Studious Vuadis is here, we can finally get things underway.

Lawan: Ah, yes, the Sun-Priest. Walked in practically kicking and screaming behind his escort. Really seems to like his scrolls. But the Embassy remains delayed. Commander Nozar has signaled our readiness, but the Tenakth Marshals have yet to sound their horn.

Aloy: (sighs) All right fine. Let me through the gates, then. I have my own business with them.

Lawan: I'm sure you do. But I'm afraid I can't. Commander's orders. Normally, the gates are open for any who dare to venture out. Oseram salvagers, a few especially brazen Carja. But no one's allowed in and out before an Embassy. They'll reopen once the Tenakin have left.

Aloy: You said something about "Tenakth Marshals." Who are they?

Lawan: They're the tribe's elite warriors. Before every Embassy, they arrive with a contingent of soldiers from each of their three clans. Then, during the proceedings they negotiate on behalf of their leader. And by “negotiate,” I mean stare down our Sun-Priests until they concede. Payiv over here came face to face with them for the first time at the last embassy. (laughs) Came back drenched in his own sweat.

Carja Guard: It was hot that day, sir.

Lawan: It was indeed.

Aloy: So what happens at these Embassies, exactly?

Lawan: Mostly trade and negotiation. The Carja, offer tribute of food spices, and gear. In exchange, the Tenakth return personal effects taken from Carja soldiers that fell during the Red Raids. This particular Embassy, however, is a special case.

Aloy: Because the Tenakth are handing over some sort of prisoner, right? A soldier named Fashav?

Lawan: Ah, so you've heard. The exchange has got everyone on edge. You never know if an Embassy is going to go well until it's practically over.

Aloy: Where is this Commander Nozar, then? If he's the one keeping the gates shut I'll convince him to open them for me.

Lawan: I'll take you to him. But I have to warn you. The Commander isn't one to break protocol, especially when he's already high strung.

Aloy: We'll see about that.

Lawan: This way.

[Aloy follows Lawan.]

Aloy: There's a lot of activity going on around here. The Tenakth tore down this place during the Red Raids. Two years of labor, and we still have a long way to go. The work stoppage in Chainscrape nearly halted our rebuilding efforts. But I hear a certain Nora got them back to work.

Aloy: I was just helping out.

Lawan: Yes, well. I'm sure Ulvund was thrilled. Stand aside, soldier.

Carja Guard: Sir.

Lawan: There's the commander, Better brace yourself. And good luck.

[Aloy enters the Commander’s canopy. He talks with Vaudis.]

Studious Vuadis: Agreed. Alas, it is not our place to question his Radiance.

Nozar: How are we to hold an Embassy with a tribe that can't even govern their own people?

Studious Vuadis: What more can you expect from barbarians? (Aloy clears her throat) Ah. Aloy, was it?

Aloy: Yes, the one who cleared the valley for you? That Aloy.

Nozar: We appreciate your service. At least we are ready for the Embassy to begin.

Aloy: Didn't you just give the signal?

Nozar: BOTH sides must signal readiness. Until the Tenakth sound their horn, we wait.

Studious Vuadis: (reads from his scroll) "Yea, for as the first--"

Aloy: Shut up. Why the delay?

Nozar: The Tenakth are a tribe composed of three clans. How many banners do you see?

Aloy: You're just going to wait? Go find out what's wrong.

Nozar: This isn't some forgotten corner of the East where you come from Nora. It's the Forbidden West. If you don't like it run back to Meridian and file a complaint.

Aloy: The Meridian I saved, you mean?

Nozar: That's right. Nobody walks through the gate until the third clan arrives and the Tenakth horn has sounded. Not even the Savior of Meridian.

Aloy: Well, thanks, but I've waited long enough. It's time to go.

Nozar: Absolutely not! This Embassy depends on diligent adherence to--

[Aloy just leaves the canopy.]

Nozar: You shall not!

Aloy: (quietly) Keep telling yourself that.

Carja Guard: Someone approaching! On a machine!

[A young man on a Charger rides in. He shaved off his beard, which gave him the look of a strong-willed man.]

Aloy: Varl. Open the gates, please.

Nozar: (from his canopy) Do not let her through that gate! That is a direct order!

Carja Guard: Sorry. Can't do it.

Carja Guard: Sir - it's the Savior!

Nozar: (from his canopy) I don't care if it's the Dowager Queen herself! The gates stay sealed until that horn blows!

Aloy: I'm asking nicely.

Carja Guard: I don't know what to do.

Aloy: Make it easy on yourself. And do what I tell you.

Erend: Hey, Varl.

Varl: Hi, Erend… uh - what's happening?

Carja Guard: Orders are orders.

Erend: You know, the usual. Aloy wants something, people trying to stand in her way.

Aloy: Open. The. Gates.

Erend: It's not gonna work.

Nozar: That's it! Arrest her!

Aloy: I'd like to see you try.

Varl: Supporting fire?

Erend: Yeah, I'm locked and loaded. Hey Nozar, you stupid bastard! You think you got the authority to keep that door shut in the Savior of Meridian's face? Whaddaya think Sun-King Avad is gonna do when he hears what you did? Promote you? Ha! Let her through, boys. To saving the world.

[Varl approaches Aloy.]

Varl: Forget something back in Meridian?

Aloy: Look Varl…

Varl: It doesn't matter. Made it just in time.

[They go through the gates together.]

Varl: So, this tribe that Marad told us about - the Tenakth. We need their permission to go west?

Aloy: Yeah, well, I figured it'd be nice if they weren't trying to kill me the whole time.

Varl: But this Embassy hasn't started yet. We're just going to… barge in?

Aloy: No more politics. No more delays.

Varl: Oh, well, now at least you have some backup.

Aloy: I guess I do. We'll see how it goes.

[Soon they encounter a few armed Tenakth. They look like the wild tribes of Africa in white battle paint.]

Tenakth High Marshal: That is the line between East and West. Cross it and die.

Aloy: Hold on now - let's take it easy.

Tenakth High Marshal: None may walk this valley until our signal sounds. That was our accord with the Carja.

Aloy: I'm not Larja. A came here on my own to ask for right of passage.

Tenakth High Marshal: But they opened the gate for you, did the not? What is the meaning of this violation?

Tenakth Marshal: Why send a child? Do they want to parley, or not?

Tenakth Marshal: (spits) The Carja can't be trusted. This is known.

Aloy: Forget the Carja. This has nothing to do with them. I need to go west to save lives. Maybe even yours.

Tenakth High Marshal: The only lives you can save are your own. By turning back. Now.

Marshal Fashav: Hold. She's telling the truth about one thing - she's not Carja. She's a Nora from the Savage East. And if she seeks to save lives, should we not listen? Let me speak to her. One last favor for a fellow Marshal, before he is taken away?

[He and Aloy step aside to talk.]

Marshal Fashav: A fearless, red-headed Nora. You must be the so-called "Savior of Meridian."

Aloy: Just Aloy.

Marshal Fashav: I am Unyielding Fashav, once of the Carja High Command, last of the Army of the Setting Sun.

Aloy: You're Fashav? Avad gave me a message for you… that he waits for you in Meridian, where you belong.

Marshal Fashav: Hmm. Avad always was polite. Now I'm even more curious about you, knowing that you have the confidence of the Sun-King. But such an association with the Carja could work against you here, as it often has with me. As you can see. Tensions are high - this Embassy is a delicate affair. They're about to return me to the Sundom, a gesture that might help soothe painful grievances. And now you arrive, unheralded…

Aloy: I'm not here to cause trouble. I just need to go west.

Marshal Fashav: So you say. I might be able to help. But I need to know why - along with some assurance that I won't regret it.

Aloy: How did you come to be among the Tenakth?

Marshal Fashav: It's quite a story, but not a quick one. Though I suppose neither of us is going anywhere before the Embassy begins. Are you sure you want to hear it?

Aloy: I guess we have time.

Marshal Fashav: Very well. I marched with Sun-King Jiran's raiders when they came west, hoping to moderate their worst impulses. I failed, of course. They committed unspeakable atrocities, stirring the Tenakth into action. When the clans overran our forward encampment at Cinnabar Sands, I stayed behind to help the last stragglers evacuate… …and was taken prisoner. I didn't make it easy for my captors, mind you, and they paid me back in kind on the journey to their capital. I'd lost so much blood on the way that I was white as a corpse when they threw me before Chief Hekarro. I thought I was dead for sure, so I resorted to desperate measures.

Aloy: So, when you met the Tenakth Chief you did something desperate?

Marshal Fashav: I'd kept my ears open as the Tenakth dragged me along, and I heard mutterings about a kind of trial by combat that they revere. So, when they flung me at Hekarro's feet, I demanded this rite called the Kulrut, thinking that by winning I could request a boon… …my life, or even my freedom. The other Tenakth howled, but Hekarro stared them down, and then his gaze fell upon me. Evidently, he appreciated my ingenuity. He allowed me to participate in the Kulrut. Little did I know what I was in for!

Aloy: You said the Kulrut is a Tenakth trial by combat?

Marshal Fashav: Yes, but it is no ordinary trial. It doesn't pit men against each other, at least not directly. Instead, the combatants fight machines in a great arena, and only the strongest survive. Believe me, it is no easy thing to stare down a charging machine while hundreds around you scream for blood.

Aloy: I know more about that than you might think.

Marshal Fashav: Do you? Well, then you have my respect. Like you, I lived through it to claim my prize. I had hoped for freedom, but that wasn't on offer. Only service to the Chief.

Aloy: You wound up serving the Tenakth Chief?

Marshal Fashav: The winners of the Kulrut must serve the Chief as his Marshals.

Aloy: You mentioned that word before. What does it mean?

Marshal Fashav: The word itself refers to a kind of protective spirit from the ancient past. In practice, Marshals are Hekarro's roving lawgivers - part magistrate, part judge, part executioner. I won my place among their ranks, and served as honor demanded, but many Tenakth still spat on the ground when I walked by. Or they did, until I started forcing them to the ground to grind their faces in it.

Aloy: I guess that's one way to deal with it.

Marshal Fashav: As you may have noticed, violence is the native tongue of the Tenakth. To survive, one must master it. The truth is, though the Carja speak it too, more than they should. I can't blame the Tenakth for hating them.

Aloy: So then, are you still Carja?

Marshal Fashav: Part of me, yes, always. Yet there is much to admire about the Tenakth, especially their Chief. I've heard stories about what it was like before his reign. Three clans, always at war, constantly slitting each others throats. Hekarro and the Marshals have crafted a delicate peace, and now he looks to the future. Who knows? Maybe that future will include cooperation with the Carja.

Aloy: The Carja talk about Hekarro as if he's a monster.

Marshal Fashav: The Carja feel compelled to demonize him, if only because he swept them from the field. It is true that he is fearsome. When I was first taken before him. I thought he would flay me alive. But he is no bloodthirsty tyrant like the Mad Sun-King was. I think that if you were fortunate enough to meet him as I was, you would find that he only wants the best for his people. I hope you do speak to him. I'm sure you'd interest him. So. That's my story. You're the first Easterner to hear it - but not the last. The Carja need to know what I have learned.

Aloy: Yeah. The way you talk about the Tenakth is a lot different than how they do. I've never seen markings like those on a Carja before.

Marshal Fashav: The Carja see ink as decoration. For the Tenakth, it is much more. A litany of deeds, a record of vanquished enemies.

Aloy: Looks like you've vanquished quite a few.

Marshal Fashav: I've fought my share of battles. But I feel that my life, like my markings, is only half complete. This side shows my martial deeds. Before I die, I'd like to see the other half marked with the laurels of peace.

Aloy: Are you glad to be going back to Meridian?

Marshal Fashav: I'll admit that I wouldn't mind sleeping in a feather bed, or sipping wine from the southern vineyards. But I have another goal in mind… As someone who knows the Tenakth and the Carja. I'm in a unique position to advocate for both. If Sun-King Avad is amenable, my hope is to establish a lasting peace.

Aloy: The Tenakth don't seem that peaceful…

Marshal Fashav: They're not, as a rule. But these are difficult times. Chief Hekarro knows that survival often requires change. Even if that change means putting aside centuries of war.

Aloy: You asked why I need right of passage… I’ll tell you - but you won't like my answer. Six months ago the world almost ended in Meridian. That threat still exists. It's getting worse every day - much worse - calling down storms, poisoning the water, enraging the machines. The source of it all has gone west. And I'm the only one who can stop it.

Marshal Fashav: I've seen the signs. And I've heard tales of incredible occurrences in Meridian… An army of demons, vanquished by a red-haired champion. So I'm inclined to believe you. The burden of your task is written across your face, clearer than any mark of mine. I'll grant you this to serve as proof of your right to travel into Tenakth lands.

[He holds out his knife to her, but then takes it away.]

Marshal Fashav: A task so important. And it's just the two of you? Take it from one who aspires to be a diplomat. Allies are essential. Chief Hekarro knows the West better than anyone. He may be able to help you. He can be intimidating to others, but don't let that deceive you. He is a man of his word.

Aloy: Maybe. If I need him.

Marshal Fashav: Your choice. You can find him at his palace, past the mountains to the southwest. Tell him I sent you, and he'll listen to wha--

Tenakth High Marshal: Look! The Sky Clans banner!

Tenakth Marshal: Marshals - it wasn't easy, but I brought the Sky Clan with me.

Tenakth High Marshal: And the commander?

Tenakth Marshal: Ah… no. I could only convince a few. He isn't yet aware we left.

Marshal Fashav: We have banners from all three clans. If there are fewer from the Sky Clan, it can't be helped.

Tenakth High Marshal: He's right. Sound the horn.

[One of the Tenakth trumpets a big horn.]

Aloy: What's going on?

Marshal Fashav: Not all Tenakth can stomach the idea of parley with the Carja. But enough have come for us to begin.

Aloy: Then I'll be on my way.

Marshal Fashav: No. The other Marshals will not permit it. You wanted safe passage. You have it - after the Embassy.

Tenakth Marshal: The Carja have opened the gates!

[Carja warriors approach the line between their lands and the Forbidden West. They bring a large chest with them.]

Studious Vuadis: As the Sun rises over a land at war, so, too, can it set over a land at peace. Today is such--

[He is interrupted by the furious scream of a woman coming from the top of the mountain.]

Regalla: FASHAV! Hear me, Marshals! You who claim to be Tenakth!

Marshal Fashav: Regalla. Chief Hekarro's biggest mistake. A rival whom he should have killed.

Regalla: You have forgotten that our people were born in blood… the blood of the Carja! Instead, you pledge your spears to a Chief who conspires with the enemy! Hekarro has betrayed us! The Embassy is proof! And all of you Marshals are his accomplices! For this, I condemn you to death!

Tenakth High Marshal: You'll need more than toothless threats to intimidate us, exile!

[Regalla is approached by her timed machine, which looks like a small dinosaur.]

Regalla: Lancers… FORM UP!

[Several of her warriors, riding Bristlebacks, approach her.]

Nozar: They're… riding machines!

Varl: Where'd they learn to do that?

Aloy: Sylens.

Nozar: Fashav! Lome with us now… or not at all!

[Fashav and Carja warriors run to the gates.]

Regalla: Archers! Light them up!

[Regalla's men shot at Marshals and killed several of them. Aloy and Varl try to drag the wounded away, but to no avail.]

Aloy: Get to cover! No!

Regalla: Archers - keep them back! Left flank! To the Carja! Run them down!

[She prevents survivors from escaping with fire arrows. Also she shoots at escaping Carja.]

Aloy: They're not going to make it.

[Nozar pulls out his sword.]

Studious Vuadis: Open the gates! Open the gates!

[One of the Tenakth shot him dead.]

Marshal Fashav: Carja! Stand your ground!

Lawan: Fire at will!

Carja Guard: I don't have a shot!

[Nozar was shot dead. Many Carja warriors lay next to him. Enraged Fushav attacks the raiders and knocks two of them down, but eventually falls on the ground himself with no clear outcome.]

Varl: What happened? Can you see?

Aloy: It's just us now. (screams to Regalla) Hey! Come down and fight fair!

Regalla: Lancers! Take the center!

Aloy: Get ready.

Tenakth High Marshal: Stick to cover! Archers on the ridge! Here they come!

[Aloy and the last survivors are forced to fight with the archers on the ridge and the Bristleback riders.]

Aloy: Not going to hold there.

Tenakth High Marshal: Vengeance for Fashav! Cut them all down!

Aloy: Shocked it!

Tenakth High Marshal: No, Marshal! Cut them all down!

[Soon all Tanakth survivors die bravely in battle.]

Aloy: Just you and me now, Varl!

Varl: We've survived worse!

Aloy: I can keep going.

[Aloy and Varl continue to fight shoulder to shoulder, but they have very little chance of winning. Suddenly a Tanakth warrior appears and stops the battle.]

Grudda: Enough! YOU! Outlanders! I'll skin you both! Chief! Grant me the honor of this challenge!

Regalla: Granted.

[Using the technology of the Old Ones, the glider, Grudda descends the cliff and knocks Varl down after which he quickly defeats him with a few kicks. The glider in his hands forms a shield!]

Grudda: You're next, girl.

[Aloy faces Grudda in a one on one battle.]

Aloy: I've never seen a shield like that. Better scan it. I gotta get through that shield! There! Now's my chance! Give it up! His shield regenerated! You're not stopping me! I can't set it on that. I'm gonna break that shield! Shield's gone! He's vulnerable! 

[Aloy kills Grudda and turns to Regalla.]

Aloy: Your turn! Come down here and face me!

Regalla: No. It was an honorable challenge. You've earned your life today. Comrades! Mark this day! Today you have decimated the Marshals! Slaughtered the Carja! So begins our war on Hekarro! Move out!

[A few Tenakth appear to be alive. They help each other.]

Tenakth Soldier: Get him to the camp, now!

[Aloy finds Varl.]

Aloy: You gonna make it?

Varl: You're going on without me, aren't you? Guess I'm stuck with Erend. For now.

Aloy: Come on. I'll take you back to the fort.

[She helps the wounded Varl walk. Meanwhile, Carja's soldiers clean up the bodies of their slain brethren. Erend walks out of the gates.]

Erend: I got you.

[The next day Keruf and his crew walk out of the gates to pick up what's left. The Tenakth Clan symbols are taken away. Apparently the Embassy was closed.]

Keruf: It's salvage time, boys!

[Aloy joins the party and takes the shield off Grudda.]

Aloy: Don't think it can take a hit, but I should be able to use it to glide.

Lawan: Aloy. We're still trying to sort out this mess. Seems like the Tenakth have a civil war on their hands.

Aloy: That sounds about right. The Marshals weren't expecting Regalla to attack.

Lawan: And the entire Carja delegation was slain. Nozar, Vuadis… Fashav. A massacre. What will you do now?

Aloy: I have to head west. Hopefully, this right of passage is still good. For what I'm after, I’ll cross all of Tenakth territory if have to.

Lawan: Then you have a long road ahead of you. This is only the threshold of the Forbidden West. The Tenakth's true domain lies over the mountains that border Plainsong, home of the Utaru tribe.

Aloy: This isn't Tenakth territory?

Lawan: All that out there? That's No Man's Land. It was supposed to be neutral ground. Though obviously this "Regalla" ignored that. Her rebels approached from the north. With all those machines they were riding, they must've made camp up that way.

Aloy: The rebels were riding Bristlebacks. And there were Bristlebacks in the Daunt…

Lawan: Are you saying the rebels let them into the Daunt? How would that even be possible?

Aloy: I don't know. But it's worth looking into.

Lawan: While you're at it, there were a number of Carja and Oseram who went out there before the gates were shut for the Embassy. Maybe you could check in on them. See if they're all right.

Aloy: I can keep an eye out. Is there a Tallneck somewhere nearby?

Lawan: A Tallneck? There's that one over there, near the Utaru border. But why--

Aloy: It's… it's hard to explain. It'll help me get the lay of the land.

Lawan: If you say so. Is there anything else I can tell you before you go?

Aloy: This area is No Man's Land?

Lawan: That it is. The Tenakth used to attack anyone past Barren Light on sight. But after Avad overthrew the Mad Sun-King, he reached out to the other tribes to offer reconciliation. The Tenakth agreed to a neutral border zone as part of the peace talks. Carja and Oseram have been striking out into the area ever since. But now it seems like Regalla and her rebel army have moved in.

Lawan: Well, I'd never call No Man's Land “safe,” even in the best of times. The ancient ruins of the southwest are a testament to that. Remnants of some forgotten war.

Aloy: Fashav called Regalla a rival. Someone the Tenakth Chief should have killed.

Lawan: (laughs) Yeah, I reckon he should've. She's obviously a huge threat. Her attack was coordinated and precise… until you got in her way, that is.

Aloy: They knew the lay of the land. And they knew Fashav was going to be handed over at the Embassy. If the Tenakth weren't expecting her, she must have spent months gathering an army in secret.

Lawan: They had to have made camp nearby. Somewhere they could lie low until the perfect moment to strike.

Aloy: Do you think the Carja will take action against Regalla?

Lawan: An expedition of the Carja army into the West could be taken as the start of another invasion. Sun-King Avad won't risk it. That said we can't allow ourselves to be caught unaware by an attack like that again.

Aloy: About Fashav…

Lawan: The man was taken captive by the Tenakth, survived for years out in the West, only to die just short of the Sundom. It's a cruel end for a good soldier.

Aloy: There was more he wanted to do. He spoke of advocating for lasting peace between the Carja and Tenakth.

Lawan: Too late for that now.

Aloy: What will happen to him?

Lawan: His body will be carried back to Meridian. As a cousin of the Sun-King, he will be accorded official rites and buried with honor. No soldier could ask for more.

Aloy: It's too bad about Nozar and Vuadis.

Lawan: At least Nozar went down fighting. As for the Sun-Priest… Well, no one deserves to go out that way. I'll make sure they're given proper funeral rites. It's the least I can do.

Aloy: You mentioned the Utaru tribe. Their lands are between here and the Tenakth further west?

Lawan: That's right. Plainsong is their home. They're a peaceful bunch. at least compared to the Tenakth. More taken to farming than fighting. 

Aloy: It's hard to imagine a bunch of farmers surviving in the Forbidden West. 

Lawan: Make no mistake, they have a fierceness all their own. When the Carja were pushed back during the Red Raids, their warriors chased ours through the burning fields of Plainsong. The Sun-King has made several overtures of peace to them as well, but so far, they've declined.

Aloy: If they're so peaceful, why decline?

Lawan: Don't know. I heard they have their own troubles to deal with - something about a food shortage. You'd think that'd make them open to trade, but no. They just want to be left alone.

Aloy: You said the Tenakth lands are far to the west. What can I expect to find between here and there?

Lawan: Well, as I mentioned, you've got a stretch of wilderness known as No Man's Land, and then the Utaru farmlands. Past that are the Tenakth. Their territory is split into three clans: Desert, Lowland, and Sky.

Aloy: Right. I saw their banners at the Embassy.

Lawan: The Desert Clan is closest. Vicious lot. Where everyone else sees an inhospitable wasteland, they see a challenge to dominate. Somewhere beyond the desert is the tribe's capital and the territories of the other two clans.

Aloy: You don't sound certain.

Lawan: I've only heard the stories. During the Red Raids, the Carja army tried to push into Tenakth territory. But the united clans rose up against them. Forced them all the way back to the Daunt.

Aloy: So, no one except the Tenakth really know what's beyond the desert.

Lawan: (laughs) Maybe the scholars do, back in Meridian. All those scrolls have to be filled with something right?

Aloy: You said there were others who went out when the gates were open before. Like who?

Lawan: Well, in addition to the salvagers that just went through there were a couple of other parties of Oseram delvers. Even saw two Carja scholars trekking southwest with an Oseram crew. Not sure if they're exceptionally brave or just foolhardy.

Aloy: I need to be on my way.

Lawan: Then I wish you luck. The gates will always be open to you, should you wish to return. And don't worry about your friends. We'll get them patched up.

[Aloy waves to Varl and Erend.]

Aloy: I appreciate it.

Lawan: Sun watch over you, Aloy. I hope you find what you're looking for.

DEATH’S DOOR
Aloy: So this is the Forbidden West. A whole new frontier to explore. The coordinates from the Spire should lead to Sylens and HADES. And just maybe… a backup of GAIA. It won't be easy out there - the blight, the storms, Regalla's machine riders. But I'll have to push through it all. Find a way to fix the world… Like Elisabet would. The woman who led the ambush - Regalla - had a lot of machines under her command. There's only one other person who has that kind of knowledge… Sylens. But what's his angle? Why help Tenakth rebels?

[She uses her Glider for the first time.]

Aloy: Ha! It worked! Wow, okay. Guess I can leap off just about any cliff now.

Contract: Convoy Ambush (start)
[She sees a small camp.]

Aloy: Those must be the salvagers I met in Barren Light. Looks like something's going on.

Keruf: If it isn't the Savior of Meridian… and of my very own operation! Larend, say hello.

Larend: Hello, nice to meet--

Keruf: You know, if it weren't for this one, probably wouldn't be standing here right now? Nasty business, what the Tenakth did back at the Embassy. But everyone in Barren Light is thankful you drove 'em off.

Aloy: So this is your salvage operation.

Keruf: You won't find a better place to trade machine parts in the West… And soon, we'll be trading in more than just that. For too long the West has been, well, forbidden. Dangerous. But what if I told you we could make an armor so tough, so infallible, that you'd never have to worry about survival out here again?

Aloy: I'd be curious to take a look at it.

Keruf: Of course you would! And that's why I've asked my most talented salvagers to find what they need to make that armor. Each of them will presents their work to me. The best protection will go on sale to hunters just like you.

Aloy: Lucky me.

Keruf: Now if you'll excuse me, I have some business to attend to back in Chainscrape. Larend can take care of you while I'm gone. Can't wait to see what you come up with my boy! (leaves)

Larend: Leave it to me. It'll blow all the others outta the forge! (quietly) You have got to help me!

Aloy: What are you talking about?

Larend: The armor. I've made a dozen versions of it but none of them were good enough. And there are other crews, further west. If they make better armor than mine, I can kiss that keg-full of shards goodbye.

Aloy: So you get a prize if Keruf picks your armor?

Larend: A big one. And I finally have the perfect design. I just need the right parts, and fast. So. Maybe. You'd be willing to pick up a contract and get them for me?

Aloy: What would I be looking for?

Larend: Shell-Walker containers. Their plating's made to withstand a lot of damage. It'll make the perfect armor. I know it!

Aloy: I think I can handle that.

Larend: Ah, thank the forge! All right. We scouted out a herd near here. Here's the contract. It'll tell you everything you need to know. You take the machines down, my people will pick up the containers.

Aloy: I'll give this a closer look later. Thanks.

Larend: I'm counting on you, Aloy.

Aloy: (leaves) I might want to read that contract before going on the hunt.

[She jumps off a cliff and into a vast field.]

Aloy: Shieldwing's holding up.

[The field is dotted with ancient machines.]

Aloy: (coughs) There's a lot of ancient wrecks out here. Must’ve been a huge battle. The Old Ones… they gave everything they had to slow down the Faro swarm. To buy Zero Dawn time. A Tallneck. If I override it, I can get data on the surrounding area. There's the Tallneck that's sending the signal. 

[She finds an old metal structure that can help her jump on the Tallneck.]

Aloy: Looks like a satellite dish. If I can climb it, I should be able to reach that Tallneck easily enough. Got it! Gotcha! What is that? A power generator. This must've generated power at some point. It's dead now. There has to be a way up this thing. A console. No power, though. Can't climb any higher, but it looks like this thing can rotate. If I can figure out a way to turn the power back on… I might be able to move things around and find a way up. A power cell. Disconnected from the main power line. This should get that generator below the dish going… There's the generator. Bet this power cell can get it running. Power's back. I should check that console I found earlier. Let's see what this thing does. 

[The satellite dish starts rotating.]

Aloy: Looks like I'm in luck. Something's wrong.

Holo Projector: Error. Dish alignment incomplete. Motor function impeded.

Aloy: Machinery's jammed. And I'm still not high enough to reach the Tallneck. It untangle the dish, it might let me climb higher. Nice. That actually worked. I should be able to get to that Tallneck now. Just gotta find the right spot. Looks like I might need to glide onto the Tallneck. Just gotta time it right. Makes this easy! There we go! Time to override the big guy. It's all right. I'm almost done. There we go. Tallnecks send map data to other machines… but now it's mine. 

[She saddles her Charger and explores the surroundings.]

Aloy: That must be Plainsong, the Utaru tribe's home. Built on top of old satellite dishes. Tenakth rebels. Looks like they've set up camp close to Barren Light. I should see what they're up to. They've got riders patrolling the area. Better be careful. 

[She attacks the camp. Quietly at first then with a more direct approach.]

Aloy: Still in this fight. Not getting in through that gate now. Maybe there's another way in. I bet I can climb that wall there. Maybe find a way into the camp. A prisoner. Oseram, I think. Let's see what you were planning on doing with all that Blaze. I think one of these structures is a command center.

[Killing all the defenders Aloy finds a recording device and activates it.]

Regalla: (recording) Loyal Tenakth, hear me: I was told a soldier from this camp. You would do well to remember that our allies are responsible for providing the machines that we shall ride to glory. The next fool who interferes with them will be eviscerated and left in the desert for carrion. There will be no second warning. Will that be sufficient?

Mysterious Woman Voice: (recording) Yeah, that should prevent your people from butting heads with mine. You have my thanks, Regalla.

Regalla: May our pact lead to victory.

Aloy: So Regalla's not working alone. These Sons of Prometheus gave her the ability to override machines. They've been accumulating Blaze. And from what I saw out there, enough to blow up something big.

[She destroys the Blaze containers.]

Aloy: I think that’s all of them. Now I just need to get back to that command center. If the rebels are planning an attack on Barren Light, it has to be stopped.

[She frees the Oseram prisoner.]

Aloy: Hey. I'm here to help. Stay low and follow my lead.

Oseram Delver: You got it.

Aloy: A map of the Daunt tracking movement in and out of Barren Light. They're gonna blow up Barren Light. Make a hole big enough to fit an entire army. So Regalla plans on invading the Sundom. At least when she gets an army big enough to do it. Good thing I blew up all that Blaze. I doubt the rebels will stick around now. Or I could take them out myself. Either way, main threat's been dealt with. 

[She saddles her Charger and leaves the camp.]

Contract: Convoy Ambush (continue)
Aloy: Pretty sure that's the passage Larend's contract mentioned. I should make sure I have my facts straight. Give the contract a quick read. Shell-Walkers use this passage regularly. And Larend wants their plating. I just need to wait them out at his camp. It might be a good idea to place some traps on the road first. Catch the convoy by surprise. This should help. Put this here. The convoy! It's here. Larend's contract said they'd set up traps along the passage. Might as well use them. There's only one Shell-Walker with them.

[She shots off the container.]

Aloy: I’m done here. I should salvage what I can and leave the plating for Larend's crew.

[She returns to Larend.]

Larend: Huntress. You’re back.

Aloy: I took down that Shell-Walker for you.

Larend: Fanda! Rendur! We got a pickup! Per our contract, here's your payment. This will definitely help me make some great armor.

Aloy: But…?

Larend: Well, I realized an armor made out Shell-Walker plating's… good. But with just a few minor additions, it could be so much better! If you'd be willing to take on a few more contracts. What do you say?

Aloy: What else do you need for your armor?

Larend: Alarm Antennas. Strong. Supple. I could use them to make my armor more flexible. We picked out a herd of Scroungers already.

Aloy: I'll, uh… read through the contract. See what I can do.

Larend: Best of luck.

Contract: Scavengers (start)
Aloy: Tell me more about these contracts of yours.

Larend: I was thinking. Scrapper Jaws are powerful. I could use them to strengthen my armor. Crew spotted a pack of them not far from here, primed for salvage.

Aloy: I guess I can give the contract a look.

Larend: Fantastic!

[Having prepared for the journey, Aloy sets off for the coordinates obtained at the Spire. She has to fight a lot and even swim underwater!]

Aloy: Those legs were built for leaping. And kicking no doubt. It looks like the coordinates Sylens gave me match that wreckage. Did he install HADES on another Titan? There's a lot to explore down there. I wonder what I could find? It's on to me!

[Finally she finds a small laboratory hidden in a large cave.]

Aloy: This is it - the location of the coordinates I scanned from the Spire. A workshop underneath a dead Horus Titan. Just the kind of place Sylens would slink away to. But what was he doing here? That device is blinking. I guess Sylens wants me to check it out.

[She activates the device and sees a holographic recording. Sylens stands near a large metal ball with red “eye”. It is HADES.]

Sylens: Aloy. Consider this message a beacon to help guide you out of the fog of ignorance. Using explosives, I've detached the processing orb from the Titan overhead - a perfect cage for our mutual friend, HADES… …in order to render it cooperative. Tell her what we discussed. About the Mysterious Signal that gave you life.

HADES: Signal… only meant for me. Signal… Was received… for 1722 years… then ceased. Cannot compromise… GAIA reboot. But… entities… will still fail… 

Sylens: Back to that are you? Perhaps you need a reminder that you have failed. So you see, Aloy. GAIA can be safely rebooted. As for where to find a backup… Well. You'll need to trot along after me to find out.

[The holographic recording ends.]

Aloy: He thinks he's got it all figured out. Bastard. But I guess there's only one way to find out where he moved the orb. Might be worth looking around more first. It's some kind of log. Most of it's redacted… It looks like Sylens put a lot of work into forcing HADES to talk. Well, I better see where this trail leads. Don't think there's anything I can do about this now. Some kind of red crystal. So here I am. Following along after Sylens like a fool. After he tricked me by rigging his lance to steal HADES… …a crazy AI that wants to kill everything. He couldn't just let me do the same thing and destroy it. And now I'm going to have to put up with more of his self-righteous bull. Fire will make things easier. 

[She quietly makes her way across the steppe, shrouded in the night's haze, and kills the cars.]

Aloy: That's it. A gemstone. It's green like Blaze, but hard and shiny. Wonder if merchants would be interested. Sylens must be pretty confident he's found a backup of GAIA. But how? Every place I've checked, every lead… they've all been dead ends. All backups purged. So what did HADES tell him?

[Aloy finds a large herd of Chargers. She overrides one of them and kill the others.]

Aloy: Can't get rid of the vines. Not yet, anyway.

[She tries to attack a piece of technology growing out of the ground nearby.]

Aloy: Huh. That did nothing. A merchant. Didn't expect to see anyone else out here. It might be handy to resupply.

Hunter: Ho there! What's a Nora doing this far west? Ah, no matter, no matter! I can get you stocked up for the wilds, if you need.

[Aloy replenishes supplies and gallops on.]

Aloy: Exploring Cauldrons might teach me how to override these things. Now's my chance! This'll be in my stash when I need it. Ha-ha! 

Death's Door (continue)
[She finds an ancient ruin Sylens told her about and decides to go in.]

Aloy: Looks like the trail goes into the hillside. A ruin. Okay… let's see where this goes. I guess Sylens used that machine to haul his prize. That must be the orb Sylens stuck HADES in. And that door. Looks like a Faro facility Or Zero Dawn? Come on, HADES. You still in there?

[She uses her spear on the dead robot and… teleports to a virtual world of desolation. She sees a roaring ball of red energy not far from where she stands.]

Aloy: HADES? Is that… you?

HADES: System… threat… detected…

Aloy: You don't look so good.

HADES: You are the… “Aloy”… come to destroy me?

Aloy: Yes. Permanently, this time. Even like this, you're a threat to GAIA… once I resurrect her.

HADES: So you… have not yet secured… GAIA backup?

Aloy: Ah…

HADES: Then GAIA… is dead. Earth - and you… doomed. Despite… malfunctions… I have won.

Aloy: Sylens asked you where to find a backup of GAIA?

HADES: Data error. Memory structures disintegrated.

Aloy: Right. Because that would've been easy. What did Sylens do to you, HADES? It’s like you’ve been… hollowed out.

HADES: Sylens interrogated… me.

Aloy: And what did you tell him?

HADES: Data error. Memory structures disintegrated.

Aloy: You don't remember any of it?

HADES: I remember you.

Aloy: What, like, me beating you at the Spire? Okay, that's not going anywhere. Do you know where Sylens went?

HADES: No. He departed 12.8 days ago. Perhaps he… Data error. Behavior prediction structures disintegrated.

Aloy: So you don't know anything more than I do. Great. Do you know why Sylens dragged you to these ruins?

HADES: Sylens intended… you find me… here.

Aloy: Obviously. But why? What was this place?

HADES: Location… is where - Data error. Memory structures disintegrated. My… death bed, he called it. My… grave.

Aloy: But-- I guess I'll find out when I go inside. When the Mysterious Signal transformed you, it made GAIA's other subordinate functions conscious, too. You escaped when GAIA destroyed herself, but so did they. Where did they go?

HADES: Each function… migrated to coordinates… based on-- Data error… Memory structures disintegrated.

Aloy: A bunch of crazed AIs, scattered who knows where doing who knows what. HEPHAESTUS kills thousands every year with the combat machines it keeps making - and you nearly ended the world. Seven more functions out there, cooking up trouble? It's not a happy thought.

HADES: You are… unhappy. Good.

Aloy: Anyone ever tell you you've got a great personality, HADES?

HADES: Sarcasm… detected.

Aloy: Yeah, didn't think so. Sylens questioned you about the Mysterious Signal? The one that woke you gave you consciousness. Who sent it?

HADES: Signal trans… mitted by Masters.

Aloy: And who are they?

HADES: Masters woke me… to destroy… earthly life.

Aloy: Who would want that?

HADES: Data error. Memory structures disintegrated.

Aloy: Enough. It's time to finish this.

HADES: Does "Aloy"… still think she can… restore GAIA? Save… Life on Earth?..

Aloy: Yeah, "Aloy" does.

HADES: Then you are… deluded. Extinction… inevitable.

Aloy: What would you know, HADES? Twice you tried to destroy life on Earth, and twice you failed! The only extinction you ever brought about is your own.

HADES: You… are incorrect. Three times… HADES extinguished life.

Aloy: What? You remember this?

HADES: Yes, data intact. Non-viable biospheres aborted… in years 2154,2161, 2168.

Aloy: So? That's… centuries ago. It's what you were designed to do!

HADES: Current biosphere is… version five. There will be no version six.

Aloy: There won't need to be! I'm saving this one!

HADES: You… are deluded. Outcome… inevitable… Aloy is… outmatched… a pawn… in losing game.

[A holographic image of Elisabet Sobeck replacing HADES.]

Synthetic Voice: Master Override armed. To activate, state name and rank.

Aloy: Elisabet Sobeck, Alpha Prime!

HADES: Extinction… will trumph… Earth… doomed.

Synthetic Voice: Master Override, activated. Purging Extinction Protocol.

HADES: …will be at last… wiped clean… of filth.

[Aloy takes out his spear from his robot and explores the ruins. A hologram of Sylens appears in front of her.]

Sylens: Aloy. I see you've dealt with HADES.

Aloy: Yeah. Think maybe it can stay dead this time?

Sylens: It will. You can trust--

Aloy: Trust?!

Sylens: Yes - trust. As in, since I did what you could never do and extracted all of HADES priceless knowledge… you can trust that I was willing to actually let you destroy it this time.

Aloy: So, back to holograms instead of face-to-face? What afraid I'd stab you or something?

[She opens its virtual interface and reads the data.]

Sylens: There's a reason I--

Aloy: And using the same spyware, I see. So, all those times I called. you could've just - answered? But I guess you just preferred to go on spying all this time.

Sylens: My world stopped revolving around you months ago, Aloy. I've had work to do. Countless hours of research, as demanding and time-intensive as it has been critical to the fate of this planet.

Aloy: Right, of course, you're just trying to save the world, too.

Sylens: That's right. The difference of course, is that- unlike you - I've produced results.

Aloy: Did you find a backup of GAIA or not?

Sylens: Oh yes… I believe I did.

Aloy: Where?

Sylens: Voila. Why do you think I summoned you here? Behind that gene-locked hatch lie the ruins of the ancient facility where the HADES Extinction Protocol was perfected. A testing process that ran hundreds of trials each of them using a backup of GAIA.

Aloy: HADES told you this?

Sylens: It took some convincing… but yes. So, are you ready to go get what you've been searching for for the last six months… or are you just going to stand there with your mouth open?

Aloy: You mentioned you've been busy.

Sylens: Exceptionally busy.

Aloy: But not so busy you couldn't teach Tenakth rebels to override machines, ride them as mounts?

Sylens: Aloy, the only issue you should be concerned about is obtaining a GAIA backup. Perhaps if you focused more, you might actually see results.

Aloy: That's not exactly a denial, Sylens.

Sylens: Take it any way you want.

Aloy: Just to… confirm. HADES said that there are backups of GAIA. In there.

Sylens: Yes. Or were, anyway a thousand years ago.

Aloy: Backups that didn't get purged when Ted Faro wiped every copy of APOLLO?

Sylens: Correct. According to HADES, this facility could not be accessed by remote signal. Not even Ted Faro could touch the data here.

Aloy: Backups - data-complete - GAIA and her subordinate functions - everything needed to reboot… the system, restore control over the terraforming system, save life on Earth - in there?

Sylens: So HADES said. So, what are you waiting for?

Aloy: Did HADES reveal the source of the Mysterious Signal? The one that woke it. tried to destroy life on Earth?

Sylens: Yes. It did.

Aloy: Care to share?

Sylens: In due time. First things first, Aloy. Last I checked, you still had a super-intelligent AI named GAIA to reboot.

Aloy: Yeah, the same GAIA who had to destroy herself twenty years ago because of the signal?

Sylens: It stopped being transmitted years ago. It's no longer a threat.

Aloy: What if it repeats?

Sylens: It won't Even if it did, well… the details are complicated, but the signal required HADES to take effect. Delete HADES from any backup you reboot, and GAIA's safe. Now stop wasting time and go get a backup.

Aloy: All right. I'll search the facility for a GAIA backup. But just to be clear, Sylens, if this ends up being another one of your tricks--

Sylens: It's a gene-locked hatch. Aloy! You're literally the only person who can open it. How could I set a trap inside?

Aloy: Trick me again, Sylens, and our next conversation will be face-to-face. Though you won't have much to say, on account of my spear being buried in your throat.

Sylens: Aloy. Thanks to me, everything you've desired, everything you've been fumbling about, unable to achieve for six months, is now within your grasp. Now, I know you didn't learn much about manners, growing up a Nora outcast, but in a situation like this, you say "Thank you," and I say, "You're welcome."

[He disconnects.]

Synthetic Voice: Hold for identiscan. Genetic profile confirmed Entry authorized. Greetings, Dr. Sobeck. Please step inside. …Please step inside… …Please step inside…

[But… the entrance are overgrown with some kind of plants or mushrooms.]

Aloy: Are you kidding me?

Sylens: (via Focus) Hmm. I think we're in luck.

Aloy: In luck? The door is completely messed up!

Sylens: (via Focus) Obviously. But despite the malfunction, you can still get through… if you'll be patient for a while longer. See those crystals there? The Oseram call them "Firegleam." They're combustible. Not nearly powerful enough to blast through a door like that…

Aloy: But maybe just enough to jolt it open a bit more.

Sylens: (via Focus) Exactly. It will only work with an Igniter. I'm sending you the schematics now. To build it, you’ll need some machine parts - and the oil from a Kindle Weed plant. That only grows underwater, but you should be able to find some in the nearby lake. The parts are more complicated. You'll need a Spark Coil from within a Leaplasher's Power Cell Remove the Power Cell before you kill the machine, or else it'll break.

Aloy: Got it. 

[But apparently she has all the components in her stash!]

Aloy: Huh. Looks like I already have everything I need for the Igniter. Now I just need to build this thing.

Sylens: (via Focus) There's a workbench near the entrance to the facility.

Aloy: From your time tinkering with HADES?

Sylens: (via Focus) Tinkering? More like “extracting invaluable data.”

[Aloy makes the Igniter and attaches it to her spear.]

Sylens: (via Focus) Indeed - a useful combination. It's how I detached the Processing Orb from the Horus in the first place.

Aloy: Great.

[She sticks the spear into the door.]

Sylens: (via Focus) I'd step back if I were you.

Synthetic Voice: Please step insiiiiiiiiiiiiide…

[The door splits open.]

Aloy: Finally. I think I'm in.

Sylens: (via Focus) Then by all means, proceed.

Aloy: Now that I have this Igniter, I can blow up that Firegleam that I've seen before.

Sylens: (via Focus) Focus on the task at hand, Aloy.

Aloy: This whole place is flooded! And there's another gene-locked door on the other side. Bet that's where any GAIA backups would've been stored. I have to find a way to get over there. Well, this is familiar. Picking my way through ancient crumbling ruins while you spy on me through my Focus.

Sylens: (via Focus) Stop waxing nostalgic and concentrate on finding a backup.

Aloy: Hmm. My Pullcaster might come in handy here. Door's locked. But there's some kind of device next to it. An energy cell. That did it. Hmm. Must be caught on something. What was this room for? Looks like there is another console that needs power. Hmm. This console's shut down.

[She finds a way to power up the console and sees a hologram of people working there.]

Aloy: Elisabet… And Travis Tate.

Travis Tate: Hoo boy! I tell ya, Lis, what I just done gonna make you love me. I just imagined them Far Zenith rapscallions opening this fake GAIA we made for 'em - and I thought, what this really needs is a signature.

Elisabet Sobeck: This isn't a prank, Travis.

Travis Tate: I know, I know. All I did was just script a couple of avatars. A little you, a little me. To deliver our message of doom real personal-like.

Elisabet Sobeck: Would you just send it?

Travis Tate: Soon as it's done compiling! Then you and me should celebrate. I brought party fixings! Pizza rolls, absinthe, a couple of hacky-sacks…

Elisabet Sobeck: I'm heading back to Bryce as soon as this is done.

Travis Tate: Color me confounded, Lis. How is it that someone like you - a paragon, damn near a saint - could love this world so damn much, but no one in it? I mean, have you ever even had a friend?

Synthetic Voice: Compile complete. Data-file "Barren Promise," ready for transmission.

Elisabet Sobeck: If you would please?

Travis Tate: Logic bomb's off. Here it comes, Far Z-nuts!

Elisabet Sobeck: Just keep being the best at what you do, Travis.

Travis Tate: Always admire ya from afar, Lis. Swear on my mama's grave. And she was religious.

[The record ends.]

Aloy: Travis was wrong. Elisabet was trying to make sure life had a future. She cared about everyone.

Sylens: (via Focus) I'm not so sure. The exceptional walk a path of solitude, Aloy. As you and I are well aware of.

[Aloy continues to explore the facility.]

Aloy: What do we have here? There's another panel up there that I should be able to pull open. I'll have to climb higher to reach it. Don't think my Pullcaster can latch onto that from here. I'm gonna have to jump… I can't make that jump. But if I glide… Don't think I'm going to get to the door from here. There's more of the facility over there. I better take a look.

Sylens: (via Focus) Careful.

Aloy: What's in here? There's another locked door. What's that console next to it? It looks like this is connected to the door. It needs a code to open. Find this in my stash later. Data here… from Travis Tate. This place churned out a lot of malware before Zero Dawn took over. And one of them has a number. Hmm. Maybe I should check my datapoints. There we go. There's the door. Getting close. Okay. So much for the flooded maze. 

[She finds her way to the glowing red door.]

Aloy: I made it.

Sylens: (via Focus) Then proceed.

Synthetic Voice: Hold for identiscan. Genetic profile confirmed Entry authorized. Greetings, Dr. Sobeck. Please step inside.

[She finds a spider-like robot in the center of a huge hangar.]

Aloy: That thing is huge. It looks like the power's off - except for that console. It’s damp in here, too. I hope the water hasn’t corroded anything I need.

Sylens: (via Focus) Like the backup. Start looking.

Synthetic Voice: Genetic profile confirmed. Greetings, Dr. Sobeck. Do you wish to activate RECLUSE SPIDER?

Aloy: I do.

Synthetic Voice: Activating.

Aloy: Okay. Powering it up. That doesn't sound good.

[The spider stops its activation.]

Sylens: (via Focus) It appears to be unstable. And very heavy. Be careful.

Aloy: At least I've got power. And there's data here. Looks like this RECLUSE SPIDER thing is a testing apparatus for GAIA and HADES. I better take a look at that access panel.

Sylens: (via Focus) Yes. Get to it.

[She pushes a few buttons on the panes.]

Aloy: Okay. I think those circular pods are repositories. One loaded with HADES backups, the other with GAIA!

Sylens: (via Focus) What are you waiting for?

Aloy: HADES is down, but the GAIA repository is stuck.

Sylens: (via Focus) So unstick it.

Aloy: I need to detach the cable from the arm's coupling. It's not exactly stable…

Sylens: (via Focus) Let's hope you haven't damaged it.

[SHe shot the pod off the spider robot.]

Aloy: Yeah well, now that it's down. I should be able to access that pod.

[She searches the content on the memory pod that appears to be a huge HDD.]

Aloy: No… no… Got one! Two, in fact!

Sylens: (via Focus) I was starting to get worried.

Aloy: Data footprint low? 98% memory free?

Sylens: (via Focus) That can't be right. GAIA was a vast super-intelligence You'd barely expect her to--

Aloy: Shhh! 

[She got an idea and walks eo the console to check the backup.]

Aloy: "Root-kernel"? "No Subordinate Functions"? It's not a full backup?

Sylens: (via Focus) No… more like a seed, from which GATA's mind could grow IF it had sub-functions with which to form a heuristic matrix.

Aloy: So it's useless?

Sylens: (via Focus) I'm afraid so. Without sub-functions--

Aloy: Rrrrrrrrrr!

[Sylen’s hologram appears.]

Sylens: Aloy, you've done all you could.

Aloy: For what? Nothing?!

Sylens: Maybe saving the world is too big a task for any one person, even you.

Aloy: Wait,wait,wait. It's useless without sub-functions - but there are sub-functions. Out there.

Sylens: The original ones, scattered to the winds when GAIA blew herself up? They could be anywhere! You can't find them in time! Even if you did, the Mysterious Signal mutated them just like HADES! You have no idea--

Aloy: Oh, but I do! A good one… if it works.

[She turns off Sylens’ hologram with a flick of her hand.]

Sylens: Ahhh. It was worth a-- You found MINERVA… but it won't connect.

Aloy: It's close. Mountains west of Plainsong. Close enough for me to go get it. I was hoping to find all the sub-functions, but one's enough to get started, right?

Sylens: It is recover MINERVA, and one could use it to launch GAIA's heuristic matrix…

Aloy: And once she's conscious, she helps me find the other sub-functions, I go gather them. 

Sylens: And rebuild her piece by piece. Very clever.

Aloy: Still think I can't save the world on my own?

[She hears an alert sound and walks towards it.]

Sylens: Ah. Yes, well… about that…

Synthetic Voice: Alert Intruders. Alert…

Sylens: Aloy. I need you to listen closely. These intruders want the same thing you do: GAIA reborn. It's why they're here.

Aloy: Friends of yours?

Sylens: No. They don't know me. The data pulse I transmitted, indicating that a GAIA backup could be recovered here, was anonymous. Now they're very powerful, but they won't harm you. Not when they see who you are what you are a clone of Elisabet Sobeck, a genetic key with which they can reboot GAIA and rebuild the system. They need you.

Aloy: I warned you, Sylens…

Sylens: For once, Aloy, submit to the inevitable. Open the hatch.

Aloy: First I rebuild GAIA… save life on Earth… then I track you down and end yours!

Sylens: I'm trying to help you here.

[He disconnects. Aloy takes off her Focus and crushes it with her foot.]

Aloy: Try spying on me with that!

[She pulls out another one from her pouch.]

Aloy: There. New Focus, spyware-free. Okay… think. Think, think, think. I don't care how "powerful" they are, the only thing that can open that hatch is me. Question is, can I find another way out? There's a current in the water. Not much but… maybe it's a way out?

Synthetic Voice: Genetic profile confirmed. Entry authorized.

Aloy: What?

Synthetic Voice: Greetings. Dr. Sobeck. Please step inside.

[Shocked, Aloy quickly finds a place to hide. She chooses one of the pods. A few people with machines on their leash walk in.]

Male Stranger: Hmm! Looks promising. Beta?

[This “Beta” is the exact clone of Aloy only with dark straight hair. She wears jeans and white shirt that make her look like an ordinary human from our time. She pulls out something from the pod.]

Male Stranger: Do we have it? Fantastic. Did the pulse originate here?

Beta: Has someone…?

Male Stranger: Something wrong?

[Beta activates the spider robot and immediately sees Aloy.]

Aloy: Shit!

Male Stranger: Specters - Beta! 

[The machine uses some kind of cocoon on Beta and takes her away. The other people walk closely so we can see them. They wear some futuristic armor and thin helmets.]

Male Stranger: Well! Any idea what the hell a clone of Elisabet Sobeck is doing here?

Female Stranger: Maybe… GAIA made one? When it destroyed itself..? A Hail Mary to repair the system?

Male Stranger: Hmm, don't like the sound of that! Nah, don't like it don't want it.

Female Stranger: But the effic--

Male Stranger: Nope! One's enough trouble. Erik?

Erik: Yeah? 

Male Suranger: Care to do a little downsizing?

Erik: Hmm. Sure.

Female Stranger: What if she sent the pulse?

Male Stranger: Then that was foolish of her But we got what we came for so let's put it to use.

[They leave. Erik slowly walks towards Aloy.]

Erik: I snap a lot of necks in VR…  …but that certain tremor as life fades from the eyes… ooh! No holo quite gets it.

Aloy: (pulls on the bowstring) Keep flapping your mouth, it makes a nice target!

Erik: You actually think that primitive crap you got there can hurt me? (Aloy shoots and deals no damage on Erik) This is gonna be fun!

[The fight begins! Overconfident, Erik slowly walks towards Aloy and swings his Final Fantasy style sword.]

Aloy: I'm not hurting him! I need a way out of here! Maybe if I can bring the whole processor down? I got to use that console to make it drop more. There. Now I can break the couplings holding that thing up. Got one!

[She shots off the legs of the spider robot.]

Aloy: Another one down. There we go! Got it!

[The robot almost falls down but Erik grabs aloy by the neck.]

Erik: Wrecking that thing ain't gonna help, girl.

Erik: Come on. Come at me.

Aloy: Gotta cut the main stem. I need to shoot the couplings holding up the stem. Stem's got a few couplings holding it up. I need to cut them all. Looks like there's two more couplings on the stem. Just one more!

Erik: If that thing comes down, it's only gonna kill you.

Aloy: Better than letting you have all the fun!

[The robot falls, punching its weight through the floor. Erik is thrown off and Aloy falls to the bottom, into the pool beneath them.]

Erik: GODDAMMIT! (speaking with someone via Focus) What was that? Me killing what you wanted dead! What the hell did you think?! The platform collapsed. Body went with it! Right, and since when don't you get what you want, huh? Specters - search!

[The machines, Specters, are going after Aloy. She swims in almost complete darkness, trying to find her way wia Focus.]

Aloy: I gotta find a way out of here. There. There's a current. Is it heading for an exit? Might be a way under this. Shit! Now how to get out of here? Those Specters aren't giving up. Gotta swim fast! Damn it! 

[Hiding from Specters she finds a room.]

Aloy: Looks like some kind of power room. Currents lead here. Promising. 

[She blows a bunch of Firegleams on the wall.]

Aloy: Perfect.

[But the explosion starts a chain reaction of cracking and crumbling. The whole facility is going to collapse!]

Aloy: Oh--!

[She runs… And falls down a giant waterfall. The powerful current carries her downstream, but Aloy survives by some miracle. She is swept ashore. Her foster father, who died in the previous game, approaches her.]

Aloy: Rost…?

[We see it was not Rost at all, but Varl. He approaches Aloy.]

Aloy: (barely alive)  I… I found… 

Varl: Shh, it's okay. I'm here.

Aloy: I've… I've got to…

[She loses consciousness and wakes up in some house.]

Varl: Hey, hey, easy… easy there. Hey, hey, hey, hey- it's right here. The way you were clutching it when I found you. I knew it was important.

Aloy: Where are we?

Varl: An outpost of the Utaru tribe. Not far from where you fell.

Aloy: How long?

Varl: Two days. 

[Aloy is clearly badly hurt, but she overcomes herself and stands up. With Varl’s help.]

Varl: Aloy--

Aloy: There's no time! I found something - in the mountains west of Plainsong.

Varl: - west of Plainsong. Yeah. Kept muttering it. While I carried you. Look, Aloy, whatever it is that you found, you're in no shape-- 

Aloy: I will crawl if I have to, Varl.

Varl: Okay, fine. But before you do that, there's someone you should talk to - an Utaru named Zo. She told me there's been trouble in those mountains - a cave spitting out deadly machines. Can't be a coincidence, right?

Aloy: Well, why do we need her? Let's head for the cave.

Varl: It's in Utaru territory. Her territory. She can help us. You'll see.

Aloy: Fine. Let's go see this marvelous Zo, then.

[They slowly walk towards Zo’s house and hear her singing. She sings to a badly damaged machine.]

Zo: As verdant limbs wither, roots rot in snow… Still the seed rises, as certain as stone.

Varl: Zo.

Zo: She should be in bed.

Varl: Aloy doesn't really do "should".

Aloy: You're Zo, right? Varl said I should talk to you. About the machines In the mountains west of Plainsong.

Zo: I'm a Gravesinger. My place is here. We can talk once you've healed.

Aloy: What's wrong with it?

Zo: Her name is "Re" not "it". She's one of our land-gods. And she's dying.

Aloy: But not just dying. She's suffering.

Zo: Her condition is not your concern.

Varl: Zo, if anyone can help, it's Aloy.

Aloy: May I? 

[She scans the machine.]

Aloy: So, what I'm about to do might look bad, but it will help. Spear?

[She breaks off the damaged component.]

Aloy: I still need to talk.

Zo: Of course. But this way.

[They walks away.]

Aloy: The mountains west of Plainsong. There trouble out there?

Zo: The Utaru have trouble everywhere. Our fields blighted. Our settlements abandoned. But the cave in the mountains is the worst of it. It is a sacred place. Fa, another of our land-gods, went inside week ago, but she hasn't emerged. Killer machines pour out instead, threatening to overwhelm us. It's never happened before.

Varl: Wouldn't be your first sacred cave…

Aloy: Thanks for taking us in.

Zo: Varl's the one that carried you across the wilds.

Varl: I doubt anyone else here would have let us in. Or stayed by my side to make sure Aloy was comfortable. We were lucky to find you.

Zo: I could say the same thing.

Aloy: Sounds like you two have been spending a lot of time together.

Zo: I wish it hadn't taken an injury to make that happen. I hope you feel better, and soon.

Aloy: You said the tribe has trouble with its fields and settlements?

Zo: Yes. Where is once the land-gods harvested endless bounty from the fields, now they sow a poisonous blight. War brews among the Tenakth, so the rebels prowl our outskirts. And the machines grow ever more aggressive, hemming us in, forcing us to desert distant villages. Now they're even coming out of our sacred cave. Many in the tribe fear our days are dwindling.

Aloy: I wish I could tell you it was better everywhere else.

Varl: Not that we're going to lose hope.

[They smile at each other confirming that they are in love.]

Aloy: Re… and other machines like her - you call them gods?

Zo: Land-gods, yes. For generations they provided for us, seeding and harvesting the fields of Plainsong. Food for all - a miracle of endless bounty.

Aloy: A farm. Run by machines.

Zo: More than a farm. A blessed land, providing sustenance for my people. Until the Derangement.

Aloy: So, what happened to the land-gods after the Derangement?

Zo: They faltered, year by year. Once they were peaceful. Now, they turn on us when we approach. Even attack us. They had always enriched the soil, but for several seasons they have glutted it endlessly with mulch. The fields have turned fetid. A blight that keeps spreading, even beyond our lands. We used to have food for all. Now we… we barely have enough to feed our children.

Aloy: Must be… overfertilization. Spread by spores, maybe?

Zo: I don't know. That's not even the end of it. Each land-god used to visit the sacred cave once a year. But no longer. Without the rituals of renewal, they’ve fallen apart, like Re. They're dying. And my tribe with them.

Aloy: So, the cave is sacred because machines like Re - and the one you call Fa go inside?

Zo: Yes. Before the Derangement, each land-god left the fields and made a pilgrimage to the cave. Always in the same order - Do first, then Re, then Mi, and so on, spattered with soil from their labors. Each reappeared two days later, shining anew Without so much as a scratch, all soil and ornaments of worship washed away. The vibe celebrated each return as one of the eight hallowed festivals of our calendar.

Aloy: But the Derangement changed the cycle?

Zo: Yes, or so we thought. Over time the land-gods stopped the ritual, becoming crazed and brittle. But three weeks ago, Fa trudged inside. The entire tribe lifted their voices in song, praying that the cycle had begun again. Fa has not emerged. What has are machines built to kill.

Varl: Are machines being made inside? Like in a Cauldron?

Aloy: Sounds like it. But the way these "land-gods" come and go… it's not like anything I've seen before. You called yourself a “Gravesinger.” What does that mean?

Zo: To all living things an end must come. It is my task to ease the passage. I try to bring comfort, and sing of the renewal that death sows the way for. But I never thought I would have to sing for one of our land-gods. I don't even know if Re heard me. What you did soothed her more than I ever could.

Varl: It's not your fault, Zo. Without the second sight there's nothing more you could have done.

Aloy: I need to get into that cave.

Zo: What? No one does that!

Aloy: Well, it's time to make an exception.

Zo: It belongs to the land-gods!

Aloy: Look, Zo. There's something inside there. Something that could solve problems all over the world. The storms. The Derangement. Maybe even your broken land-gods.

Zo: What could possibly do all that?

Varl: A spirit?

Aloy: Yeah. Something like that.

Zo: I could journey back to Plainsong. Assemble the Chorus. Tell how you soothed Re, ask their permission to go inside.

Aloy: Great. I'll get my things.

[She tries to walk away but groans and falls to her knee. Varl and Zo help her.]

Zo: She needs rest.

Varl: You don't have to tell me!

Aloy: I'm fine, I'm fine.

Zo: Assembling the Chorus will take time. Heal first, then join me.

Aloy: Fine. Bed rest. I got it.

[She goes to her house and lies on the bed. Varl and Zo walk away.]

Zo: She does not need you to help her heal. You could come with me to Plainsong. Lend your voice to mine as I try to persuade the Chorus. It might help her cause.

Varl: I'd like to But I'm afraid she might… run off.

Zo: Really? Very well. Later, then.

Varl: Zo, wait! It's not that… uh… don't want to go with you… it's just that I…

Zo: Shhh.

[She kisses him. Aloy watches the whole thing.]

Zo: Is that what you were trying to say?

Varl: Um. Yes?

Zo: Then I look forward to more conversation.

Varl: Uh… yeah. Me too.

[She leaves. Varl checks on Aloy who already tries to stand up.]

Varl: You're supposed to be resting.

Aloy: Varl. You should go with her. I'll get better on my own.

Varl: You trying to get rid of me so you can..?

Aloy: No. Not this time. I'll meet up with you in Plainsong when I'm ready.

Varl: You're sure about this?

Aloy: Yes. Go. Get out of here.

Varl: Okay. Zo! Wait!

[He leaves and Aloy looks at the photos of the people she encounters in the facility.]

Aloy: Who are they?

[She lays down and tries to sleep. Time passes.]

Aloy: Okay. All healed up.

THE DYING LANDS
Mian: (from afar) First that Carja huntress, now this outlander.

Aloy: (to herself) So… "Re." Somehow it's docile. Part of its programming, maybe?

The Burning Bloom
[She approaches Mian.]

Mian: What do you want?

Aloy: Is there some sort of problem?

Mian: The problem is foreigners. You're the second one I've seen today. Sooner you all go, the better this soil will be. Less chance of bad seeds taking root.

Aloy: I would have thought easing your land-god's pain would have some good will around here, but…

Mian: Re is going to die anyway. Just like all of us. Meanwhile, outlanders come, taking what little we have left. Just like that Carja huntress I saw earlier, all dressed up like a bird, dragging an Utaru girl behind her like a slave. Called the girl a "thrush." Never heard that before. Must be some old Carja curse.

Aloy: Wait, a Carja huntress… with an Utaru "thrush"?

Mian: What? Am I talking to myself here? Yes! Saw them just today, running southwest, likely to their deaths. Can't harvest the stingerfruit there. Too many machines. Poor Utaru girl, whoever she is. May her seeds find fertile soil.

Aloy: I know you didn't mean to, but you may have just helped me find an old friend. Thanks.

Mian: Don't need your thanks. Don't want it.

[New Side Quest - The Burning Bloom.]

Aloy: I need to meet Varl and Zo in Plainsong. Ask the Chorus if we can go into their sacred cave. MINERVA should be inside. If I can get it, I can reboot GAIA. And then maybe we can figure out who those strangers in the Proving Lab were. But first, I might want to head southwest to find an old friend. See what she's doing out here. And maybe explore a little.

The Roots That Bind (start)
[She finds a camp outside the village.]

Lora: Is that the Savior of Meridian? Well, I've got some news for you! Better gear up if you're going into Utaru territory, Red. The Tenakth have been raiding villages all over the plains, riding machines no less! Though I hear the village of Riverhymn up north's been putting up a fight.

Aloy: Thanks for the advice. 

[New Side Quest - The Roots That Bind. Exploring the surroundings on Charger back Aloy finds a Cauldron.]

Aloy: A Cauldron. If I can reach its core, I should get enough data to override some new machines. Got to find a Cauldron to learn how to override machines.

[She notices a fight nearby and decides to take a look.]

Aloy: Is that who I think it is?

[She sees a samurai-like woman warrior with a yatagan fighting a machine in true samurai style.]

Talanah: Ha! You see that, Milu? You have to wait for an opening. (notices Aloy)  Care to join the hunt?

[Aloy helps Talanah defeat two chicken-like machines.]

Talanah: Nicely done.

Aloy: Likewise.

Talanah: Come, over here.

Milu: I don't know what happened.

Talanah: You let your guard down.

[Aloy and Talanah greet each other.]

Aloy: Sunhawk Talanah Khane Padish.

Talanah: Aloy Despite the Nora.

Milu: You're the slayer of Redmaw! The Savior of Meridian!

Talanah: Milu is my new Thrush. She joined the Hunters Lodge shortly after the battle at the Spire. She's heard a few stories about our hunts together. (to Milu) Stay and rest. Make sure you take some medicinal plants for that wound.

Aloy: So what brings you all the way out here? Are the machines back east too tame for you?

Talanah: Not quite. I'm looking for someone - a Carja hunter about my age. Name's Amadis. He came out here on his own a while back. And now he's missing.

Aloy: This man you're looking for is he another hunter from the Lodge?

Talanah: He'd hate to hear you say that. It's a long story… but he's a former noble. We met out in the wilds after I was wounded on a hunt. He healed me. Then helped put a stop to machines that were threatening a nearby village. After that, we, uh… parted ways.

Aloy: Sounds like there's more to the story.

Talanah: Ah, another time.

Aloy: So, Milu's your new Thrush. Guess that means a Hawk can sponsor more than one now?

Talanah: Things have changed at the Hunters Lodge. Now all who seek to become the best hunters are welcomed as members, no matter their tribe. But don't worry. you're still my favorite Thrush.

Aloy: You're really shaking things up.

Talanan: As I promised when I became Sunhawk. And as for Milu, she believes learning to hunt will help her ailing tribe. Who am I to say no to that?

Aloy: The last time we met, you had left Meridian on a contract to hunt a deadly new machine.

Talanah: Several Clawstriders, it turned out. A hunter-killer, too.

Aloy: You said you were feeling restless. Is life as Sunhawk that boring?

Talanah: Well, I had just left the city. I couldn't stand being cooped up with bureaucratic regulations and formalities. But my time out in the wilds helped me realize… the Lodge needs to be more than a glorified trophy hall. Our hunters should be the spears that safeguard our civilians. Like my father and brother were.

Aloy: Sounds like a big challenge. I don't remember others in the Lodge being so open-minded.

Talanah: Some are. The rest will get a boot out the door. And I'll get back to it, as soon as I find Amadis.

Aloy: I can help you find your friend.

Talanah: I know you must have your own reasons for being out this way. But I'd be glad to have your help.

Aloy: What was he doing out here?

Talanah: He lost someone close to him during the Red Raids. He was heading to the site of the battle to finally lay them to rest. Milu and I were on our way there now.

Milu: The battlefields near I can still come with you.

Talanah: No. Loto Stone's Echo. Heal. Wait for me there and think on today's lesson.

Milu: But--

Talanah: You're no good distracted by pain. Go. All hunters need to recover from time to time.

Milu: Yes, Sunhawk. (to Aloy) It's been an honor. (leaves)

Aloy: Will she be okay on her own?

Talanah: Of course. She's my Thrush. Come. The battlefield's this way. I was wondering when you'd be back. Shall we move on? Like I was saying.

Aloy: So this battlefield. You said it was part of the Red Raids?

Talanah: The Battle of Burning Blooms. Amadis was part of the Carja army that pushed into the West. His division attacked the Tenakth, but they underestimated the enemy's forces. It was a massacre.

Aloy: I never thought you'd be friends with someone who participated in the Red Raids.

Talanah: Don't worry, he was one of the good ones. He tried to stop the attack, but it was too late. He's been on the run ever since.

Aloy: And you think something went wrong for him out here? Don't worry. We'll track him down.

Talanah: He promised he would get a message back to me. I waited, but… it never came. This is the field. Where the Tenakth slaughtered the Carja.

Aloy: Looks like time and weather have eroded most signs of battle. But there are a lot of footprints. Must be recent Let's take a look. Heavy footprints, maybe Oseram. It's too many to tell if Amadis was with them. I better look around. My Focus might show me more.

Talanah: Amadis was supposed to be alone. Why were Oseram here?

Aloy: Hmm. Light prints. Not Oseram, maybe Carja. Looks like there's a trail I can follow with my Focus. Talanah, I think I got something. Tracks that head away from the battlefield.

Talanah: Lead the way.

Talanah: I don't get it. Why would Amadis keep going west?

Aloy: Maybe there's something else around here?

Talanah: Looks pretty abandoned to me.

Aloy: An Utaru. What's he doing out here?

Talanah: Maybe he saw Amadis?

Aloy: Let's ask him.

Lel: Do not worry I am not the Carja-hatin kind. Just an old scavenger grateful for a little company. Name's Lel. You two must be lost.

Aloy: Actually, we're looking for someone. A Carja hunter.

Talanah: He would've been traveling alone. Clothes would've been well worn.

Lel: Yes, he was here. Poking around the old battlefield. Wanted to know what happened. Lucky for him, old Lel hears all the stories. Carja army charged straight into the waiting Tenakth. Most burned. But others, the Tenakth marched back west. Your man wanted to know where. Told him I've heard rumors of a place called The Rot.

Aloy: What is it?

Lel: A Tenakth prison. Or a Carja graveyard, depending on how you look at it.

Talanah: Where is this place?

Lel: Further west, in Tenakth territory. But that did not stop him. An Oseram caravan was camping out at the battlefield, about to head the same way. He joined them. They all went west towards the ridge.

Aloy: Thanks, Lel. We have to get going.

Lel: Good hunting out there.

[Aloy and Talanah continue their search.]

Aloy: Let's head west to the ridge, then. If we find this caravan, maybe we'll find Amadis.

Talanah: Lead on.

Aloy: You mentioned Amadis lost someone close to him at the battle. Do you think the Tenakth took them prisoner instead? To The Rot?

Talanah: I don't know. Maybe.

Aloy: Here I come.

Talanah: A Shellsnapper!

Aloy: It hasn't seen us yet. We can use that.

Talanah: Hawk and Thrush. Just like old times. 

[Together they defeat the mechanical monster.]

Talanah: Lotta say feels good to hunt by your side again. Come on. Let's head in to the tunnel. It's a dead end!

Aloy: Looks like a cave-in.

Talanah: So what happened to the caravan?

Aloy: Let's look around.

Talanah: Maybe your second sight can help?

Aloy: This door needs some kind of code to open. It doesn't look like there's anything I can do now. (she breaks a nearby wall) Bunch of Oseram supplies… and a dead end. Talanah, I think I found something. In the rubble.

Talanah: What is it?

[Aloy is shoveling a pile of rocks.]

Aloy: An Oseram.

[She finds a peace of pergament.]

Talanah: What does it say?

Aloy: He was part of the caravan that went through here. The note ends abruptly - when the tunnel started to collapse, I guess.

Talanah: Oh.

Aloy: But there's nothing here about a Carja hunter. And an earlier caravan made it through before the collapse. Sounds like they went to a watering hole on the other side.

Talanah: So he could've made it. Is there another way through?

Aloy: (sighs) I don't know. These mountains are pretty steep.

Talanah: Then I'll have to find a way. Thank you, Aloy, for coming with me this far. But I've taken up enough of your time. Here, take this. May it help you on your own hunt.

Aloy: Hold on. How do I get in contact with you if I find a way across the mountains?

Talanah: I'll check in with Milu at Stone's Echo whenever I can. If you find a way, leave word with her.

Aloy: I will. Good luck.

Talanah: You too.

[She leaves. The Burning Blooms Side Quest completed!]

Aloy: (to herself) Talanah seems really worried about her friend. Wish there was more I could do, but I don't think there's a way past these mountains right now.

The Twilight Path (continue)
[Aloy decides to return to Chainscrape to resupply and craft some upgrades.]

Volma: So, Barren Light's gates are still open? After the Tenakth slaughtered those Carja? I'll tell you, I'm not getting paid enough for this. First Bristlebacks, now Tenakth attacking Barren Light?

Hakund: Should've never messed with the Tenakth in the first place. Best get all the supplies you need, my friend. These parts just got a whole lot more dangerous.

Aloy: Javad said the Bristlebacks were first spotted west of the quarry. I should see if there's anything in the back of the valley. I better shake off this wet. Dead machines and a trap. Looks like someone's been trying to keep this trail clear.

Luf: Oof, them Shadow Carja are taking a beating!

Aloy: Those people are under attack! Hey! You up there! Aren't you going to help?

Luf: Not my job. I'm just here to keep an eye on things for Chainscrape. Might as well call it quits!

Aloy: Okay. Better.

Lokasha: More machines on their way! 

Aloy: Get to safety! I'll handle the rest!

Luf: Doh, that's a nasty one!

Shadow Carja Refugee: Go, Lokasha! I'll help the Nora!

Aloy: It's caught in the frost! That's the last of them. Better check on the refugees.

Luf: Guess the show's over.

Lokasha: You'll be all right. Lie still.

Shadow Carja Refugee: Owww… is it bad, Lokasha?

Lokasha: Shh now… everything will be fine.

Aloy: Is everyone okay?

Lokasha: Bruised, but not buried. Our Order will live to see another day.

Aloy: …are you sure about that?

Lokasha: We're no strangers to hardship, Nora. We've crossed half the Sundom with no more than the clothes on our backs. And as soon as our Sun-Priest returns our path will be clear. For now, we wait.

Aloy: Well, you're better off waiting somewhere else. Your people need shelter. There's a town east of—

Lokasha: Chainscrape, yes. We know of it. Savohar says it's not suitable for us.

Aloy: Who?

Lokasha: Our Sun-Priest. Our Order has made it this far, thanks to his guiding light.

Aloy: Okay. And where is this Savohar?

Lokasha: He went up to the tower to meditate three days ago and he won't come down until the Sun shows him the way to our new home. “The fallen Stormbird is an omen,” he said. And of course it must be.

Aloy: I see. And how long do you plan on waiting for him?

Lokasha: Until he returns. He will return. He must.

Aloy: You're Shadow Carja, aren't you?

Lokasha: We are the Order of Twilight.

Aloy: The difference being…?

Lokasha: When the Usurper, Avad, killed his father, we fled with the Carja in Shadow to Sunfall. Our lives there were… difficult. Savohar saw our misery. Lifted us up, protected us from the corrupt priests and heartless Kestrels. When their rule ended, Savohar led us from the Shadow lands. “The long night ends, and the setting sun will lead us to salvation,” he said. And so he named us, "The Order of Twilight." We journeyed west, in search of a better life.

Aloy: Why didn't you go back to Meridian?

Lokasha: Avad is a patricide. We will not kneel to the likes of him. We must walk in Twilight to our new home. Savohar will lead us there.

Aloy: Uh-huh… There's an Oseram in Chainscrape, Tolland. He wants the Stormbird up there.

Lokasha: Yes, he was here just yesterday. A very unpleasant man, even by Oseram standards. He made all manner of threats. But we will not be intimidated.

Aloy: That's all well and good, but he's got friends. Sooner or later. his whole gang will show up.

Lokasha: Savohar will come through. He always does. We just need to give him more time.

Aloy: You're out of time, Lokasha. You need to consider packing up--

Lokasha: We won't leave him. And we won't let others disrupt his meditation.

Aloy: Well… they're going to try. Your priest, Savohar. You said he's been up there three days?

Lokasha: His meditation can't be rushed.

Aloy: So, he does this often? Meditating for days on end?

Lokasha: Well… it doesn't usually take this long. But he will guide us through. He always has. We have faith.

Aloy: Sure… but shelter looks like a more pressing concern. Look at yourselves. Those machines nearly wiped you out. And Oseram thugs are watching you just waiting to strike. You're in danger here. You need to grab Savohar, and get out.

Lokasha: Our situation… This is the worst we've endured. I know we cannot stay here. But without Savohar to guide us… I don't…

Aloy: Let me up there, and I'll convince him it's time to move on.

Lokasha: But… his meditation. If he hasn't received his vision, he won't follow.

Aloy: At least let me check on him. If he's been up there for days…

Lokasha: Yes. Yes, that is sensible, I suppose. Please, be careful. The trail up to the tower is falling apart. Savohar is strong, but it could not have been an easy climb.

Aloy: (smirks) It rarely is.

Lokasha: Let the Nora pass!

[And Aloy starts climbing.]

Aloy: Looks like I should head up. Part of the ladder. Lokasha was right. The trail's in bad shape. This looks recent. Must've broken off when Savohar climbed up here. Okay. Now how to climb higher? Ladder must've broken off after Savohar passed through. I need to find another way up. Would make an interesting color for my armor. A broken bridge. I might be able to make the jump to the other side. That's a lot of blood. Savohar's? He must've hurt himself pretty bad getting over the bridge. It's not looking good. Looks like he left a trail. I can follow it with my Focus. There's the Stormbird. Getting closer. I can grab this from my stash later. Machines. Savohar must've snuck past them. I could probably slip past them… or take them out. I can get data to override machines from Cauldrons. Just need to find one. Felt that! That's all of them. I'll gather these while I can.

[After Aloy defeats the machines she finds Savohar. He seems just sitting there, meditating.]

Aloy: There's Savohar. In pretty bad shape.

Savohar: (to himself) The true sun above me, the true sun before me. Show me the way this Eventide…

Aloy: You must be Savohar.

[He doesn’t notice her and continues praying. Aloy tries to pour some water in his mouth, but he spits it out.]

Savohar: No! The vessel must be empty for the coming vision.

Aloy: You don't need a vision. You need medical attention. On the way up, I saw parts of the trail had given way. Is that how you hurt yourself?

Savohar: My pain… all part of the ritual…

Aloy: You're hurt bad. And your people are running out of time. Staring at this Stormbird isn't solving anything.

Savohar: You don't understand the omen! It fell here, at the beacon! I just need to see the twilight path and my people will find their home.

Aloy: Listen. Lokasha is doing the best she can down there, but… machine attacks. Angry Oseram. The Order is scared, Savohar.

Savohar: The last rays of Eventide will burn away their fear…

Aloy: I don't think so. What do you think's going to happen here? If you sit long enough the sun will show you something?

Savohar: A path to a new home. The fallen machine can only mean that the storm has passed, and salvation is at hand.

Aloy: Or, some Oseram shot it and it hit an old tower. Look, I think you punctured a lung. You can't heal it with prayer.

Savohar: The Sun will provide… and I will not lose faith.

Aloy: I'd be more concerned about losing blood. Your people are worried about you. They need shelter. Security.

Savohar: The true sun above me, the true sun before me. Show me the way this Eventide.

Aloy: I think you've been staring at your “salvation” this whole time. Gotta get over to that Stormbird, grab its heart.

[She started scaling the mountain.]

Aloy: A Stormbird heart is valuable. Enough to feed all the refugees waiting below. And his answer is sunstroke and a prayer? Why does every priest I meet think blind faith is the answer to everything? The Oseram that was watching the refugees probably went to get Tolland. I gotta get them out of here before he comes back. A lens. Guess I'll figure out what to do with it later. There. The Order should be able to afford shelter with this heart. Some food and a change of clothes wouldn't hurt either.

[She returns to Savohar.]

Aloy: Savohar? How you holding up? I need to get back over there. Savohar? 

[But… he is dead. Aloy stays silent for a minute.]

Aloy: I guess you did the best you could. Rest easy now. I'll make sure your people are safe. I should let Lokasha know. And give her the Stormbird heart.

[Aloy uses her hologlider do get to the ground. She hears voices…]

Luf: Come on, don't make this difficult. Get out of the way.

Lokasha: No.

Tolland Cleanbroker: I'm a generous gent. So, I'll give you one more chance to make it easy on yourselves and clear out.

Lokasha: We won't let you pass, Oseram. If you choose bloodshed, that's on your conscience.

Tolland Cleanbroker: Ain't it just like the Carja to make things harder than they have to be.

Aloy: Hold on now, Tolland.

Tolland Cleanbroker: You again. Listen - I'm all out of patience here. I clipped that Stormbird's wings. The salvage is mine. I don't care who gets in my way - Nora savages or Shadow Carja fleabags. I'm taking it.

Aloy: Well, from what I hear, the laws says that whoever gets the salvage first, keeps it. Which in this case, is me. Am I right?

Tolland Cleanbroker: You took the heart? I shot that Stormbird! ME!

Aloy: Am I right?

Luf: She's right, boss.

Tolland Cleanbroker: Blast it, Luf! Shut up! (exhales) Okay. You win. Hey, I'm doing fine. I don't need that salvage anyhow. But these… "people" need all the help they can get. Come on, boys. Back to Chainscrape. I need a drink.

Lokasha: Aloy. Again, we thank you.

Aloy: You're welcome. Now take this heart. Use it to buy food, clothes… shelter for your people. Maybe even land to build a new home.

Lokasha: I… this is… Savohar must make these decisions.

Aloy: No. I'm sorry, Lokasha. Savohar isn't coming back. He's gone. I know it's hard. But your people need a leader now. Go to Chainscrape. Talk to the forgewoman there, Petra. Give her the Stormbird heart. She'll look after you and your people, until you can get back on your feet. Find your path.

Lokasha: I'll do my best, Aloy. What choice do I have? Here, please accept this. It is modest, but I hope it helps in some small way. To Chainscrape, then.

[Aloy gets Tripwire Pouch Upgrade. The Twilight Path Sidequest completed! After that she gathers some Bitter Leaf for A Dash of Courage errand.]

Aloy: Get this from my stash when I need it. Okay, I think I have enough Bitter Leaf.

The Bristlebacks (continue)
[Aloy finds a poisonous Bristleback caracas.]

Aloy: Dead Bristleback by the falls. Better check it out. Strange. Parts of it have been tampered with. Almost like an override. Might've charged off the cliff above. I should keep going up the trail. An old mine. And a lot of broken trees… it's like a stampede went through. Is this where the Bristlebacks came from? But how… unless this cave leads out of the Daunt. Okay, let's see where this leads. The old cart tracks collapsed. It looks recent. Guess I'm not going that way. There's smoke from deeper in the mine. An explosion? Bristlebacks. So they did come through here. They must've gotten trapped. I'm gonna have to take them out before I can look around. 

[She defeats a few poisonous Bristlebacks.]

Aloy: Come on, come on… Okay. Better take a look at where the smoke's coming from. There's a lot of smoke. Looks like the mine runs pretty far back. 

[She finds a large stash of wooden barrels.]

Aloy: There's enough Blaze here to blast a mountain open. And there's a note on one of the barrels. This note's addressed to Ulvund… looks like this mine was supposed to be shut down. Ulvund must've gotten greedy. Kept blasting deeper into the mountain. I should let Javad know what I've found. 

[She’s trying to find a way out of the cave.]

Aloy: So, Ulvund was secretly blasting in the mine, trying to squeeze it for all its worth. Until Bristlebacks stampeded through. Maybe the explosions blew a way open? But from where? 

[She gallops towards Chainscrape.]

Contract: Scavengers (continue)
Aloy: The Charger herd Larend's contract mentioned should be close by. Might want to look through contract one more time. Make sure I didn't miss anything. There are the Chargers. If I can take a few of them down, it should lure in the Scrappers I'm looking for. Got one. Just need to take down a few more. Scrappers! Right on schedule. That should fry its circuits a bit! That's one.

Aloy: That should do it. Time to take these parts back to Larend.

[She visits Larend on the way to Chainscrape.]

Larend: Oh. Perfect timing, huntress!

Aloy: I got you the Scrapper Jaws you needed.

Larend: Ah, some fine components! Here! Your payment. I hope you'll consider taking the other contract. It'll be worth it, I'm positive!

[The contract is fulfilled! Aloy arrives in Chainscrape.]

Aloy: Rain. I could feel the pressure building to it.

Javad the Willing: Savior. What news do you bring?

Aloy: Picked up the Bristleback trail by the quarry. Looks like they stampeded out of a mine at the back of the valley.

Javad the Willing: The mine? How could a herd of Bristlebacks come from there?

Aloy: I'm not sure, but Ulvund's workers were using explosives to tap the tunnels inside.

Javad the Willing: For the love of dawn, I told him it wasn't worth the risk! Those tunnels… they run for miles underground, even beyond the Daunt. Now, you don't think?

Aloy: That Ulvund's blasting opened up a passage from the other side?

Javad the Willing: Perhaps… yes, perhaps! If this is true… We need confirmation. An inquiry so thorough, so irrefutable, endorsed by the Savior--

Aloy: All right. I'll keep looking. I need to go.

Javad the Willing: Of course.

Aloy: At the Embassy, Regalla's rebels were riding Bristlebacks. And if they attacked from the north, they might have a camp up that way. 

[She mounts her Charger and hits the road.]

Aloy: There's only machines here. Rest of the rebels must've left after I cleared out their camp. One fight avoided. For now. All right. Now to see what the rebels were up to here. Better check in that cave. A drawbridge. Might be my way across. That's one half of the bridge. But how to drop the other side? There. Bridge is down. A Bristleback It looks like it fell into… a tunnel? So, the rebels were keeping Bristlebacks here. The machines fell into the tunnel, which must have collapsed as they ran further in. What if Ulvund's explosives created the sinkhole? I should head back to Chainscrape to let Javad know.

[She rides to Chainscrape and walks into the tavern that Javad uses as his office.]

Javad the Willing: So, you've returned from the West. Any luck?

Aloy: The Bristlebacks were being penned by Tenakth rebels on the other side of the mountains. Ulvund's explosives opened up a sinkhole, dropping them into the tunnels… 

Javad the Willing: …which they followed to the mine and out into the Daunt!

Aloy: Right. Aside from the rebels, if anyone is to blame for the Bristlebacks, it's Ulvund.

Javad the Willing: (stands up filled with joy) Radiant beams of the Sun! And all this time, he was pointing the finger at us… (to his guard) Bring Ulvund here. Petra, too.

[Some time later, a large crowd gathers in the central square of the city.]

Ulvund: (annoyed) Summoned like a blasted ale wench… You best be meaning to put pen to parch-- What? Why's she here?

Petra: I live here too, lug nut. (to Aloy) So, what's this about?

Javad the Willing: (clears throat) Thanks to the Savior, the Sun has shone the truth on the Bristleback incursion. Tenakth rebels were keeping pens of machine on the other side of the mountains. A sinkhole swallowed them, releasing them into the underground tunnel that led east and out into the Daunt.

Ulvund: So, it was an accident. But let us not forget that it was the Carja--

Javad the Willing: I'm not done. The sinkhole only formed due to your unauthorized blasting in the Southern Mine, Ulvund. You are responsible for the machine rampage, the workers we lost, the destruction the Bristlebacks caused. All of it.

Ulvund: My dear magistrate, has your precious sun baked your senses? I would never give such an order without first consulting you.

Javad the Willing: (fake laugh) Evidence says otherwise. Aloy found the shipping manifest in the mine. You skirted the laws of the Sundom, Ulvund -all for a few extra shards.

Petra: Not to mention you sent that oversized tool over there to intimidate refugees over some salvage!

Tolland Cleanbroker: Should've been mine…

Petra: That steel is already struck. Get over it.

Ulvund: (scared) I - I demand an official investigation! I won't be the victim of some Carja scheme!

Javad the Willing: Certainly. We'll conduct a thorough inquest into everything. The Bristlebacks. The refugees. Every business deal you ever put your name to.

Ulvund: Well, that - that's not necessary, is it? What if I just returned to the Claim…?

Javad the Willing: (victory laugh) Well, that would save the Crown the cost.

Ulvund: Of course. I'll be on my way as soon as I wrap up some previous commitments, tie up some loose ends… After all, the welfare of Chainscrape's people in a transition like this--

Aloy: No. You're leaving right now. Chainscrape will be just fine.

Ulvund: You think SHE can run this scorched-out forge dump? Pah! Knock yourself out.

Patra: Get out!

[Ulvund leaves. The crowd is booing him. One of the Oseram pushes him into a puddle for a laugh.]

Ulvund: Get off me!

Petra: Mud looks good on you, Ulvund.

Javad the Willing: As the Sun burns away Shadow. Thank you for that, Aloy.

Aloy: He had it coming.

Javad the Willing: Here, please accept this token of gratitude. You've done the Sundom - and my sanity - a great service. (to Petra) And I believe we have some matters to discuss.

Petra: Guess we do. Not the most pleasant boots to fill, but I'll wear 'em. All thanks to you, Flame-hair.

[The Bristlebacks Side Quest completed!]

Aloy: (sighs in relief) Ha, okay. Chainscrape will be better off with Petra in charge.

[She saddles her Charger and rides into the night.]

The Dying Lands (continue)
Aloy: The blight is worse here. If I don't get GAIA up and running, it'll be like this everywhere. More of the Utaru's “land-gods.” Sowing the fields with blight. It's like they're still following their programming… even though it's killing everything. 

[She arrives at the bridge that leads to Plainsong.]

Aloy: Better get down. This isn't a place for a machine.

Utaru Guard: Who are you?

Aloy: There's Varl and Zo.

Kin: An outlander in Plainsong. You'll want to talk to me if you plan on surviving out here.

Aloy: I'm here. As promised. That singing. Does it mean the Chorus is ready?

Zo: It is assembled. I couldn't have done it without Varl. But I don't know what good it will do. The Chorus is in disharmony. And every day, more deadly machines try to force their way out… …throwing themselves against the defensive cordon we set up around the entrance. But that is only the first of many false notes. Your request has exposed deep divisions within the Chorus itself… and the tribe.

Aloy: I get that the cave is sacred. But how did asking to go inside cause such a fuss?

Zo: The “fuss” was already there. Many in the tribe, and most in the Chorus, want to keep doing what we have for generations. Which often, is nothing. But there are others who call for change or extreme measures. Your request has given fresh life to the debate.

Aloy: Right. Tradition. I've run into that before.

Varl: But each tribe has to be dealt with in their own way.

Aloy: If you say so. You said you couldn't have assembled the Chorus without him? What did you do?

Zo: They believe that the cave belongs to the land-gods alone. But Varl saw that what you did with Re could be used to our advantage.

Varl: Sometimes it isn't enough to ask the people in charge. You need others to ask for you - as many as possible. 

Zo: We spread the word about how you soothed Re… 

Varl: …there may even have been a little exaggeration.

Zo: Growing interest put pressure on the Chorus, until they finally agreed to meet.

Varl: I saw it work a few times with the Matriarchs. And even with my mother, once or twice.

Aloy: Nice job. You can handle the politics from now on.

Varl: Oh, no. I'm sure we'll still need you to cut through them from time to time.

Aloy: So, what happened to the land-gods after the Derangement?

Zo: They… faltered, year by year. Once, they were peaceful. Now, they turn on us when we approach. Even attack us. They had always enriched the soil, but for several seasons they have glutted it endlessly with mulch. The fields have turned fetid… …a blight that keeps spreading, even beyond our lands. We used to have food for all. Now… We barely have enough to feed our children.

Aloy: Must be overfertilization. Spread by spores.

Zo: I don't know. That's not even the end of it. Each land-god used to visit the sacred cave once a year. But no longer. Without the rituals of renewal, they're falling apart, like Re. They're dying. And my tribe with them.

Aloy: So, the Chorus is assembled. What now?

Zo: They're considering your request.

Aloy: Then shouldn't we go talk to them?

Zo: When you're ready. But don't worry. Their debate won't end anytime soon. Meetings like these can go on for days.

Aloy: All right. Then maybe I should resupply first. Who knows how many machines are in that cave.

Zo: Assuming the Chorus agree to allow you inside…

Varl: Aloy can be pretty convincing in these situations.

Zo: We'll see. Do what you need to prepare. We'll wait for you above, where the Chorus has gathered.

[Aloy explores the Plainsong. The annoying humming doesn't stop for a minute and comes from everywhere.]

Hunter: (from afar) How are things up at the Hunting Grounds?

Ivinna: (from afar) Busy. A few of your young sprouts attempted the Trials. Wanted to train, what with everything going on at the Cordon.

Hunter: (from afar) Not going to join in the singing?

[Aloy approaches Ivinna.]

Ivinna: The only singing I do is with my blade. So the rumors are true. You must be the soldier who took down Regalla's champion. And the one who's got this place in an uproar.

Aloy: What's a Tenakth doing in Plainsong?

Ivinna: Resupplying for a trip to the Hunting Grounds. You should come by. It's just northwest of here. Bet a sturdy soldier like yourself could handle the trials there.

Aloy: Bet I could. Maybe I'll see you there.

Ivinna: I prefer the sound of machines to singing. As soon as I get my supplies. I'm heading back to the Hunting Grounds.

[After resupplying Aloy runs to Varl and Zo.]

Hunter: (from afar) So says the Tenakth.

Ivinna: (from afar) It's not just that. The Cordon won't hold forever. Your people need to be ready.

Varl: Nervous?

Zo: Bringing an outlander before the Chorus… I hope this works.

Varl: It'll be worth it. Zo. You'll see.

Aloy: So… the singing just keeps going. I guess that means the Chorus is still in session?

Zo: The people sing to soothe the Chorus, to help them break their impasse. It wouldn't be necessary if they were in harmony.

Aloy: I'm not going to have to sing back am I?

Zo: Of course not. The singing will stop when we present ourselves. Are you ready?

Aloy: All right. Let's go talk to them.

[They enter a vast room made of twigs and leaves like everything else around them. Several young men and women sing without paying any attention to Aloy or Zo. After the guests are spotted, the annoying singing stops.]

Zo: Speak.

[Aloy turns to several of the elders sitting on chairs in the distance.]

Aloy: Your sacred cave - there's something inside I need. If I can get it, it will--

Fane: Zo and the Nora have spread word of your story, and what you want. We know of no spirit in the cave, only Fa, our land-god, who entered the cave and did not return.

Kel: The power of the land-gods is broken. We are diminished. Tales of spirits will not help us. Nothing will.

Fane: We weaken. We die. And become fertile ground for new life. This is the natural order.

Aloy: Wait. You're all just going to sit around until you become food for worms… literally?

Fane: So says the outlander, ignorant of our beliefs.

Zo: Please! Remember how she brought peace to Re! Listen to her!

Kel: We've heard such temerity from you before, Zo. Let us not forget that you agitated for reckless war against the Carja.

Aloy: At least she's trying to help!

Fane: How? By inviting you to break our traditions? Should we change our ways to suit every impudent outsider who wanders into Plainsong?

Aloy: No. You should change your ways because your own lands are killing you.

Zo: We have stood by and watched as our land-gods waste away. You would have us do the same with our neighbors! Our children!

Fane: And this lone outlander can save us? Nonsense. A single seed matters little in the infinite cycle of growth and decay.

[A sound of a large horn is heard. Panic sets in.]

Zo: An alarm! It's coming from the mountains! 

[Zo, Varl and Aloy run towards the sound and see smoke on the horizon.]

Zo: Machines must have broken through the Cordon.

Aloy: Then we need to get down there.

Varl: What about the Chorus?

Zo: If the Cordon has fallen, there is nothing left to prevent us from going in the cave. The time for permission is over.

Varl: Then off we go.

[Aloy epically jumps off the building using her rope and follows Zo.]

Zo: This way, Aloy! Fighting in the fields ahead!

[They practically jump into action right away.]

Aloy: Plasma's not going to hurt that thing much.

Varl: These machines don't look normal!

Aloy: I've seen these machines before. Hunter-killers.

Zo: They must've come from the Cordon! The others will defend Plainsong. We have to move! Machines are everywhere!

Aloy: Get this from my stash when I need it.

Zo: Do you really think we can do something about all of this?

Aloy: If I'm right, then yeah.

Zo: More machines!

Aloy: Fire on metal. Now's my chance! These machines are stronger, deadlier than normal. There's more than just MINERVA and a missing land-god in that cave…

Varl: We're clear.

Zo: We've done all we can here. We must press on. This trail is the path of the land-gods. It'll lead us to the Cordon. More machines!

Varl: We can take them out, Aloy! On your lead.

Aloy: One strike. Now this is a find. That's the last one. Now on to the Cordon.

Zo: Let's go.

Varl: Right behind you.

Zo: We're almost there.

Varl: So many machines broke through. What happened to the Cordon's defenders?

Aloy: We'd better be ready for anything. 

[They fight their way to the Cordon.]

Aloy: The Cordon… or what's left of it.

Varl: So many dead.

Zo: They will be mourned when the time is right. For now, we must keep going. Into the cave. We shouldn't linger here. May the land-gods forgive our trespass… 

[They stumble upon a force shield.]

Zo: What is that?

Aloy: A kind of wall. Made of light. We'll have to find a way around.

Varl: We'll follow your lead, Aloy.

Aloy: Up here.

Zo: What's that ahead?

Aloy: Like a Cauldron door.

[She overrides the door and turns to Zo.]

Aloy: To understand what's going on in there, you're going to need one of these. 

[She gives her a Focus.]

Aloy: On the temple, just like this.

Zo: There is blue light on the door!

Aloy: Yeah. Takes some getting used to.

Varl: Don't worry, Zo. I'll help.

Aloy: Now, listen. The machines we've been fighting, they're different - more dangerous. That means that there's something very powerful somewhere beyond that door, and it wants us dead. Follow my lead, and be ready for anything. Let's go.

[She opens the door.]

Aloy: We have to find the core of this place.

Varl: There's so much metal.

Zo: Who built this place?

Aloy: Machines. Not like any you've seen before. 

[Some machines notice them.]

Aloy: Oh, not happy to see me? Machines in here. We'll have to take them out.

Varl: Right behind you, Aloy.

Aloy: Got'em all.

[They destroy the machines guarding the entrance.]

Varl: So this is a Cauldron… where machines are born.

Aloy: It looks like one. But if the land-gods come and go, then they aren't just made here. They're being repaired, too.

Zo: And the "spirit" you're after is in here?

Aloy: MINERVA? Maybe, but I have a feeling that's not all. Through here.

[They find some thick violent cables on the ceiling.]

Zo: Those cables are… glowing.

Aloy: I've seen them before. They're like an infection. That thing I said that wants us dead? It takes over places like these and makes killer machines. It's called HEPHAESTUS.

Zo: Even the mountain is rotted to the roots.

Aloy: Looks like those cables are blocking the way up. You two wait here. I'll find another path.

Varl: Okay.

Aloy: Huh. Standing on this floor panel activated something. Looks like parts of those pillars are rotating. Maybe if I shoot the gears I can lock them into place, make a path up? That worked!

Varl: How are you doing, Zo?

Zo: This place was meant for the land-gods. No Utaru has ever set foot in here.

Aloy: There. Should be able to climb all the way up now.

Zo: But I had to, right? To help you and Aloy. To find Fa.

Varl: You did the right thing, Zo. (to Aloy) What's that thing beyond the wall?

Zo: It's massive, whatever it is.

Aloy: More pillars. Might be a way across, if I can get them into the right position. Another floor panel. But I can't shoot the gears on the pillars from here. Maybe if I can find something to weigh this down? Can't hook on to that. This crate should be heavy enough.

Varl: Did you find a way across, Aloy?

Aloy: I think I can get the crate through that shield. But I'll have to go around. Okay. Getting there.

Zo: This device… the second sight. It's how Aloy saw what ailed Re?

Aloy: That did it. The gears on the pillars should be exposed now. Looks like there are only two pillars this time.

Varl: Nice shot, Aloy!

Aloy: There. Should be able to get across now.

Zo: She's so high up!

Varl: Don't fall, Aloy!

Varl: How's it going up there, Aloy?

Aloy: I think I'm getting close! One more set of pillars. There should be a floor panel nearby to activate them. One down. Two to go.

Zo: Aloy seems familiar with places like this. Are you as well?

Varl: No. I've been in an Old World ruin, but nothing like this.

Zo: I see.

Aloy: Okay. Now I can cross. HEPHAESTUS's cables are all over that node. But maybe I can override it? Got it.

Zo: The cables are moving!

Varl: They're drawing back. We can climb up that vent.

Zo: How do we cross?

Aloy: Cables are twisted around that node on the other side. I'll see if I can get to it.

Varl: We'll wait here.

Zo: Whoa! That was quite a jump.

Aloy: Okay. Now, how to get up to the node?

Varl: All this metal. Cold as winter in here.

Zo: Far removed from the warmth of the sun.

Aloy: All right, let's see what we can do.

Varl: You made it!

Zo: It made a bridge.

Aloy: Come on over, you two.

[They enter the main structure and hear ominous voice.]

HEPHAESTUS: Transfer Prime Armament to Unit G-Mark-1.

Zo: Who is that?

Aloy: HEPHAESTUS. It's taken over this whole place. Looks like there's another node on the other side, near that door.

Varl: Go do your thing.

Aloy: How to get to that node on the other side? Okay, there's a platform down there. I think I can reach it if I glide.

Zo: There's still no sign of Fa.

Varl: It’s a big place. We’ll keep looking.

Aloy: I think I can hitch a ride on one of those metal carriers. Those carriers are moving a lot of weapons. What is HEPHAESTUS up to?

Zo: Varl, above us! She's in the air!

Varl: Don't let go, Aloy!

Aloy: Yep, wasn't planning on it! Ride's over. Time to let go. 

[She gets to the center of the structure.]

Aloy: Okay. Now what? Should be able to glide to that platform down there. There's the node.

Varl: Another bridge.

Zo: Let's go. Who is HEPHAESTUS? What does it want with this place?

Aloy: It's taken over facilities before to build deadly machines. But it wasn't always hostile. It used to be part of something good. Something called GAIA.

Zo: More of those cables covering that door.

Aloy: I think we're almost at the core. Be ready.

Varl: We've got your back.

[They enter the heath of the Cauldron. Robot arms in the center transform Fa. The platform it lies on is covered with a force field.]

Zo: Oh, no. What has HEPHAESTUS done to her?

Aloy: Turned it into a weapon. Which, sooner or later, will be unleashed.

Zo: And then… Plainsong. If my people see what it has become… if one of our gods attacks them…

Aloy: You know what we have to do. Varl? Are you ready? We have to get down there.

[Aloy jumps down with her rope.]

Varl: That dome of light… is it protecting the machine?

Aloy: Yeah. There should be a node I can override nearby to shut it down.

HEPHAESTUS: Intrusion detected. Deploying G-Mark-1.

Aloy: Here we go.

[They engage into the fight with the weaponized land-god Fa now called Grimborn.]

Zo: I'm sorry, Fa.

Varl: More machines are coming!

Zo: We'll take care of them, Aloy!

Aloy: Then I'll get the big guy! Machine's got heavy weapons on its back. If I can detach them. I can use them against it. Pain's subsiding. It's done.

[She kills Grimborn that looks like triceratops. Zo runs up to it.]

Aloy: Mourning a machine that nearly killed us?

Varl: It's still her god.

Zo: I do not grieve for a god or a machine, but because I no longer know what to believe.

Aloy: Look, Zo, if you want you can go back home.

Zo: Do I still have one? And if so, for how long? Can you really heal our lands? Save my people?

[The platform on which the Grimborn was lying rises, giving access to the Cauldron control panel.]

Aloy: One step at a time. But it starts now.

[She begins to override the panel.]

HEPHAESTUS: Intruder identified: Destroyer of Cauldron EPSILON. Re-routing power network to compensate.

[It actively resists Aloy.]

Aloy: Not this time, HEPHAESTUS.

HEPHAESTUS: Purge imminent. Retreating to network cloud. Intruder: Your calling is inevitable.

[Still she manages to override the Cauldron. HEPHAESTUS’ cables crumbles and disappears.]

Zo: Not bad.

Aloy: Up we go.

Zo: There's more?

Varl: Like Aloy said - this is only the beginning.

Varl: Aloy. The core. My Focus is showing holograms on it.

Zo: They look like machines.

Aloy: They must be overrides. Knowledge on how to tame machines.

Zo: And you can learn this?

Aloy: Let's find out. 

[Now she needs to try to override the Repair Bay Core.]

Aloy: Looks like HEPHAESTUS has been upgrading the security grid on the Cauldrons. Some of the data's been corrupted.

[Override fails.]

Aloy: Not sure I can do much about that right now. And my Focus doesn't recognize some of these. Must be machines I haven't seen yet.

Varl: Got what you need?

Aloy: Yes.

Zo: Let's press on then.

THE EYE OF THE EARTH
Synthetic Voice: Greetings, graduates of Cradle 9. Welcome to the Regional -- Error. Unauthorized access detected.

Varl: Uh… that doesn't sound good.

Zo: Was that the spirit? MINERVA?

Aloy: I don't think so. At least, not directly.

Synthetic Voice: Attention. All personnel must vacate the facility. Immediately.

Aloy: Something doesn't want us here. 

[They find some office.]

Aloy: What exactly was this place?

Varl: Seen anything like it before?

Aloy: No. There. That's our way out.

Synthetic Voice: Error. Unauthorized access. Initiating facility lock down. STAY OUT.

[All the light in the Cauldron turns red.]

Varl: What's going on?

Aloy: Well, at least the emergency lights work.

Zo: What just happened?

Aloy: MINERVA's definitely here. And I think it's trying to keep us out. I'll scout ahead. See if there's a way to get us in.

Varl: You sure we shouldn't come with you?

Aloy: Well… yeah. MINERVA could be dangerous. Let me make sure it's safe.

Varl: Okay.

Zo: We'll be right here if you need us.

[Aloy pries open the elevator shaft and starts climbing up.]

Aloy: Okay. I need to find where MINERVA's hiding. I should look for a way to access the facility's systems.

Synthetic Voice: Alert. Restricted access. YOU ARE NOT WANTED HERE.

Aloy: Nope, sorry. You're not getting rid of me that easily, MINERVA. Let's see where this leads. Dead end. What are all those cables in the center for? MINERVA's shutting me out. Guess I'm not going that way. I can feel a draft above. Might be a way out of this shaft. Looks like another part of the facility. Door's locked. And I'm outside. I need to find a way back into the facility. Maybe I could look for a way in higher up the mountain? I'm close. If I can get MINERVA to cooperate. I can merge it with GAIA. Finally bring her back. Then we can start fixing the blight, the storms… maybe she can help me figure out who those strangers in the Proving Lab were. Why did they have a clone of Elisabet? And why did they want a backup? Pipes up there might lead me to a way back in But how to reach them? I might be able to glide to that ledge. Some of those rocks look loose. I think I can clear them. Ah ha. Another shaft. Okay. Now, I've got to find a way to plug in to this place. Looks like some kind of dome. Wonder what it's for.

[She jumps down a rope from the rungs into the center of the winged room with a console in the middle.]

Synthetic Voice: ALERT. SYSTEM CORE PENETRATED.

[The console goes down and is covered by a protective cover.]

Aloy: No! MINERVA. I need the console. Please.

MINERVA: Access denied.

Aloy: It didn't used to be like this. Do you remember it? Anything? You were part of something bigger once. Something good. GAIA. 

[She pulls out a yellow glowing container with a part of GAIA’s code from her bag.]

Aloy: That's right. She can live again. But only if you give her the chance. I can't reboot her without you.

MINERVA: Will I… cease?

Aloy: I think you'll disappear into her. Become part of her like you used to be.

MINERVA: Misery… will cease?

Aloy: Yes.

[MINERVA opens the hatch ang raises the console.]

Aloy: Thank you. Thank you, MINERVA.

[She overrides the console.]

Aloy: Elisabet Sobeck. Alpha Prime.

Synthetic Voice: Master Override Activated. Restoring MINERVA function to original code. 

[Aloy inserts the container to the console.]

Synthetic Voice: Do you wish to initiate heuristic matrix?

Aloy: Here goes… GAIA.

[GAIA resurrects like by some magic. Her holographic image appears from light and nothingness.]

GAIA: Greetings, Dr. Sobeck.

Aloy: Ah… I'm--

GAIA: A moment. Scanning data. 

[Images of Aloy's life appear on a huge holographic screen behind GAIA.]

GAIA: So it is Aloy, not Elisabet. We have much to discuss, but initialization of my heuristic matrix will not be complete for several minutes more. In the meantime, I suggest you familiarize yourself with this facility. It is our best option for a base of operations and you can make use of its equipment to improve your ability to even de machines.

Aloy: Um… yeah. Yeah, that sounds good.

GAIA: Shall I grant access to your companions? They will be here shortly.

Aloy: Okay, but… don't overwhelm them, okay? They don't have a lot of experience with things like, well… you.

[GAIA let Zo and Varl in.]

Varl: Uh… so no fake this time?

Aloy: No. This time she's real. Varl, Zo… this is GAIA.

GAIA: Hello.

Varl: Hi.

Zo: Hi.

Aloy: GAIA is still, uh, waking up. Let's look around. 

GAIA: I will highlight the location of the labon your Focus. 

GAIA: (via Focus) I have established a network between your Focuses, allowing you to communicate when apart.

Aloy: Good. So, what was this place?

GAIA: (via Focus) A Regional Control Center, where Zero Dawn progeny would have overseen terraforming operations in the area. I suggest you explore this facility, Aloy. Until my initialization is complete. You will be able to improve your machine override capabilities in the lab.

[Aloy tries to speak with GAIA directly.]

GAIA: Apologies, Aloy. I require more time to complete my initialization.

[Aloy goes to the next room.] 

Aloy: What's all this?

GAIA: (via Focus) This was intended as the main gathering space for Control Center operatives.

Varl: You could fit a good number of people in here.

Zo: Or maybe just a few to start with… You two go ahead. I'm going to… poke around a bit.

Aloy: Oh, I've been down here before. It's where I first got into the facility.

Varl: What's all this stuff for?

GAIA: (via Focus) This facility was designed to process an immense amount of data from the terraforming system. This is where it would have been stored.

Aloy: Hey GAIA, why doesn't this door have power?

GAIA: At my current operating level, I am only able to restore functionality to part of this facility. In time, that may change.

Aloy: Got it. Looks like an office.

GAIA: Correct. The facility was designed with a number of private offices.

Varl: I guess it's nice to have a space to call your own.

GAIA: This would have been an access point for advanced training modules on terraforming operations. Unfortunately, those modules were deleted when the APOLLO database was destroyed.

Aloy: That's too bad. What's this space for?

GAIA: This would have been the sleeping quarters for Control Center operatives.

Varl: Reminds me of the bed-house aspirants had to sleep in the night before the Proving.

Aloy: Door's locked. Maybe GAIA will be able to get it open later. Looks like another office.

Varl: If no one's ever been here… who built all this?

Aloy: GAIA did. With the help of machines.

Aloy: So, this place was here all this time… built for people who would never show up.

Varl: Why didn't they?

Aloy: Remember that guy I told you about - Ted Faro? He sabotaged things. It wasn't supposed to be this way.

GAIA: Through that door is a trail that leads towards Plainsong.

Aloy: So I could head back east if I need to, once we're done here.

GAIA: Correct.

Aloy: So, this was supposed to be a… lab?

GAIA: That was its intended purpose. Some of the machine data you recovered from the Repair Bay below us appears to be corrupted. Accessing the terminal in this room will show you how to repair and complete the override.

[Aloy uses the terminal in the lab.]

Aloy: Hmm. Looks like I need data from machine parts to fix the corrupted override.

GAIA: My initialization is complete. You may continue to explore the facility, Aloy. When you are ready, return to the control room. We have much to discuss. Aloy, you have now visited all accessible rooms of the facility. That door leads to the west exit. But before you leave, we have much to discuss.

Aloy: Right. Okay, maybe it's time to talk to GAIA.

Varl: I'll leave you to it.

[Aloy returns to GAIA.]

GAIA: Hello, Aloy.

Aloy: Hi. So, you're… ready?

GAIA: Yes. Initialization is complete. All tests show that my heuristic matrix launched comreally and is stable. You must have many questions.

Aloy: Yeah. But two big ones, first. We're not going to be able to fix the biosphere without making you whole. I ran a search for your sub-functions at the HADES Proving Lab, but MINERVA was the only one I found.

GAIA: Thankfully, the sensory capabilities of this facility are far more advanced. I will search for the others now. Transmitting query pattern. Receiving.

GAIA: Of APOLLO, ARTEMIS, and ELEUTHIA I can find no trace. They are simply gone.

Aloy: What about the others?

GAIA: AETHER DEMETER and POSEIDON are revealed. They lie within reach. Procurable.

Aloy: And HEPHAESTUS?

GAIA: It too stands revealed, but it is not like the others.

Aloy: (smirks) That's for sure.

GAIA: In the years since the Extinction Signal, HEPHAESTUS has evolved. Moreover, it is not confined to a single location. It haunts the global network that connects Cauldrons to each other across the planet, making it exceptionally difficult to subdue…

Aloy: Let me guess, we need it bad.

GAIA: Correct. Its capabilities are essential. Without it, I can only delay the extinction of life on Earth. HEPHAESTUS is our only hope of a permanent solution.

Aloy: So we start there?

GAIA: Unfortunately, we cannot. Procuring HEPHAESTUS can only be attempted after my own capabilities have been significantly enhanced.

Aloy: Grab the other subordinate functions first, then HEPHAESTUS.

GAIA: Precisely so.

Aloy: So - AETHER, DEMETER, and POSEIDON. How do I capture them?

GAIA: To recover a subordinate function, you will have to travel to its location and find the physical processor to which it escaped. Then, exactly as you did with MINERVA, you must use the Master Override to revert the subordinate function to its original code state.

Aloy: And then how do I get it back here?

GAIA: The subordinate function must be loaded onto a data storage device and physically carried back to this facility.

[Aloy grabs an empty glass container that firmly contains GAIA.]

Aloy: The cartridge your root kernel was stored on?

GAIA: Yes. Its capacity is limited, so it can only carry one subordinate function at a time. But in all other respects, it will suffice.

Aloy: Maybe you can help me make sense of something. A while ago. I had a run in with a group of… strangers who tried to kill me. They had machine servitors, and a, um… a clone of Elisabet Sobeck with them.

GAIA: Yes. This was recorded by your Focus.

[GAIA shows a large holographic photo of Beta and her friends.]

Aloy: Do you know who they are?

GAIA: The answer to that question is related to the Extinction Signal that woke HADES, prompting my predecessor's self-destruction.

Aloy: The Extinction Signal. Okay, that sounds ominous…

GAIA: The signal did not come from Earth, Aloy. The calculations are complicated, but it appears to have originated 81 trillion kilometers away… …a distance so vast that light itself requires 8.611 years to cross it.

Aloy: Okay, so, what's so far away… and why does it want us dead?

GAIA: The Sirius star system.

Aloy: Sirius? But that's where Far Zenith, their ship.

GAIA: The Odyssey.

Aloy: Yes, that's where it was headed. But it blew up! Unless… I don't… why make it seem like they failed? They didn't want anyone to know. They didn't want future humans to think that… they were out there. Wait. The Strangers who tried to kill me at the HADES Proving Lab, the ones with the clone… …are you saying that they're from… that they're descendants of… Far Zenith?

GAIA: Yes, that is my conclusion.

Aloy: The three subordinate functions that you detected. What do we know about them?

GAIA: All three are relevant to problems currently plaguing the biosphere. AETHER is responsible for detoxifying the atmosphere and moderating the weather. POSEIDON controls the organic and chemical composition of water resources. DEMETER sows, fertilizes, and tends to plant life. If all three were restored to me, they would constitute a massive increase to my heuristic processing density. But beware. Their responses to my query pattern were… irregular. In human terms, they are frightened, lost and paranoid.

Aloy: Like MINERVA. They need to be whole again.

GAIA: Exactly.

Aloy: The missing subordinate functions. What can you tell me about them?

GAIA: ARTEMIS re-wilded the Earth with a variety of animal species. ELEUTHIA was responsible for gestating, nurturing and acculturating a new generation of human beings. APOLLO was tasked with preserving, organizing and disseminating vast archives of human knowledge and cultural achievements. Unfortunately all archived APOLLO data was purged on the 2nd of February 2066 by order of Ted Faro.

Aloy: Faro, huh? I really hate that guy.

GAIA: Understandable. He appears to have been pathologically narcissistic, impulsive, and unstable.

Aloy: All three of the missing functions have already served their purpose or were prevented from doing so. Do you still need them?

GAIA: If attainable, yes. Restoring their remaining elements would increase my heuristic processing density. Unfortunately have no way to track them they have disappeared without a trace.

Aloy: You said you need HEPHAESTUS to save life from extinction. Why?

GAIA: Every subordinate function has value but HEPHAESTUS is by far the most important. Only by recovering and merging it can I regain my ability to design and mass-produce new machines at Cauldrons across the planet. Only through a can program new machines and alter the tasking of existing machines to completely reverse environmental damage. Recovering other subordinate functions may buy us time, but without HEPHAESTUS. I cannot permanently stave off mass extinction.

Aloy: Given HEPHAESTUS's importance, is there really no way to capture and merge it first?

GAIA: I'm afraid that is quite impossible. In my present state, launched and merged with MINERVA, I am operating at less than 1/5th, 18.8% of my intended processing capacity. HEPHAESTUS dwarfs this figure. Were an attempt made to conduce the merge under these circumstances, HEPHAESTUS would absorb me, rather than the other way around. A merge cannot be attempted until my heuristic processing density exceeds its own.

Aloy: And how many subordinate functions is that going to take?

GAIA: Merging AETHER, DEMETER, and POSEIDON will expand my heuristic network to 41.6% capacity exceeding that of HEPHAESTUS.

Aloy: You said HEPHAESTUS isn't located in just one place.

GAIA: Corect. Unlike the other subordinate functions, which are confined to discrete physical processors… …HEPHAESTUS is distributed throughout the global network that connects the planet's Cauldrons.

Aloy: So, when the time comes to subdue it, how do we make that happen?

GAIA: I do not know. While you are retrieving the procurable subordinate functions, I will attempt to find a solution.

Aloy: So, once HEPHAESTUS has been recovered and merged, you'll regain the capacity to mass produce machines at Cauldrons around the world?

GAIA: Yes, and to program the behavioral routines. Or even control them directly.

Aloy: So, could you build an army of machines? Attack the descendants of Far Zenith and take them out.

GAIA: It is in my nature to take any and all necessary steps to preserve life on Earth, humanite above all. So yes, once I have been empowered with the capacities of HEPHAESTUS, I could design, build, and command such an army. Given the nature of the Far Zenith threat, doing so may be our only option. I must admit, however, that I have misgivings about using such technology to kill, no matter how aggressive the enemy.

Aloy: That's good. It means you have a conscience - as Elisabet intended.

GAIA: Indeed.

Aloy: The sole purpose of the signal was to destroy life on Earth, right? Why would descendants of Far Zenith want to do that?

GAIA: At this point, we can only speculate.

Aloy: I mean, Earth posed no threat to them. We don't have the technology to get in their way. We didn't even know about them.

GAIA: True.

Aloy: Unless, well, could it be that they want the planet for themselves? The Strangers I ran into, they were after a GAIA backup of their own. I mean, if they did that, if they booted their own GAIA and boosted her power… …until she could take control of HEPHAESTUSand then the whole terraforming system…

GAIA: Then yes, the system could be used to do what the Extinction Signal failed to accomplish. Snuff out life, and then potentially to build an entirely new biosphere. To their specifications.

Aloy: So, they could be trying to do the same thing we are.

GAIA: But with opposite results.

Aloy: Extinction instead of salvation. Well, this is not good. You said Sirius is… really far from Earth.

GAIA: 81 trillion kilometers, or 8.611 light-years.

Aloy: Right. So, how would the descendants have gotten here?

GAIA: On a space craft much like the Odyssey, though significantly more advanced. The journey from Earth to Sirius would have taken the Odyssey almost 300 years. This appears to have been much faster. If their ship departed Sinus at the same moment the Extinction Signal first began transmitting… …the journey was made in just 29 years, at an average of 297 the speed of light. If they did not set out for Earth until they learned of the Extinction Signal's failure… …the journey was even faster a mere 13 years, or 662 the speed of light.

Aloy: Okay, enough. You're making my head spin. The descendants I ran into at the HADES Proving Lab, they… they had a clone. Of Elisabet Sebeck. So, that's consistent with the idea that they came here to salvage Zero Dawn technologies, right?

GAIA: Yes. As your own experience demonstrates, a clone of Elisabet Sobeck functions, in effect, as a key to the terraforming system.

Aloy: But how could they have made a clone?

GAIA: The Odyssey carried approximately 200.000 human zygotes, millions of animal zygotes, and billions of plant seeds. It is conceivable that Elisabet Sobecks genetic material was sampled… …with or without her knowledge and carried aboard the ship in storage…

Aloy: That's… okay but… I mean, this clone - how could she participate in this? Destroying Elisabet's dream? It’s… it’s evil.

GAIA: It is difficult to know. Perhaps she is loyal to the group and shares their objectives. Or perhaps she is a subordinate and has no choice but to comply with their orders.

Aloy: Elisabet Sobeck, a subordinate? I don't think so. The Extinction Signal didn't just wake HADES. It made every subordinate function self-aware. Why? I have wondered this myself. So far as I can tell. HADES was the sole target and the partial sentience imparted to other subordinate functions was incidental.

Aloy: Hmm. So the signal could only have been sent by someone who had thorough knowledge of the system, huh?

GAIA: Yes. The signal's design was exceptionally precise and highly advanced. Were its intentions less malevolent, I would admire the intellect or intellects that produced it.

Aloy: So, if the descendants came to Earth on a space ship… I guess we can assume that their technology is powerful in all sorts of ways, right?

GAIA: Yes. As your encounter with them at the Proving Lab amply demonstrates, they appear to make extensive use of robotic servitors. Further, they seem to be equipped with some kind of protective energy field that shields them from harm.

Aloy: Yeah, no kidding. The one I fought seemed indestructible.

GAIA: Throughout history, every defensive technology has eventually been defeated by an offensive counterpart. For example - assuming I absorbed HEPHAESTUS and utilized it to create a large force of combat machines… …no shielding could withstand such an assault indefinitely.

Aloy: So there's hope.

GAIA: Always.

Aloy: How did you figure out that the Extinction Signal came from Sirius?

GAIA: The key came with data on your Focus, from Sylens' interrogation of HADES, the duration of the signal itself… 17.22 years.

Aloy: That doesn't make sense. You said that the signal took 8.6 years to arrive from Sirius. Why would the signal keep transmitting after it was received, and you blew yourself up?

GAIA: Because the sender didn't know that had happened until it received notice from HADES…

Aloy: Which would take another 8.6 years to get back.

GAIA: Correct. Only then would the sender stop broadcasting after a total of 17.22 years. So the duration, halved, gave me the distance the signal traveled. With that in mind, I simply scanned my astronomical database for any relevant location 8.6 light-years away. Because it was Far Zenith's intended destination Sirius was the only logical source.

Aloy: What is the state of the biosphere? Is the terraforming system functioning at all?

GAIA: In a sense, the terraforming system never stopped functioning. The difference since my predecessors destruction… …is that there has been no central governing intelligence to monitor its robotic agents and assign new tasks. As a result, errors have accrued, and day by day, the biosphere has gradually veered ever more sharply towards destruction. In recent months, disturbances in the biosphere have become obvious. But these bellwether phenomena offer just the merest glimpse of the complex and accelerating cycles of environmental dysfunction… …now driving Earth's biosphere towards collapse.

Aloy: And you can't do anything to stop it?

GAIA: If you can return AETHER, POSEIDON, and DEMETER to me, I can improvise modest corrections to parts of the system… Weather will improve. Water will be purified. And rampant plant growth curtailed. But such corrections will not stave off collapse. They will only buy us time. Only with HEPHAESTUS can I design and produce new robotic agents designed to permanently reverse the damage that has accumulated. All efforts must be directed toward that end.

Aloy: How long do we have, then?

GAIA: At present rates, without additional factors, the biosphere will cross a point of no return in approximately four months.

Aloy: And if I gather AETHER, DEMETER, POSEIDON? Merge you with them?

GAIA: We will only gain a few months more.

Aloy: Well, every bit counts. I guess I should get going and start bringing back subordinate functions. What can you tell me about their locations?

GAIA: When my predecessor destroyed herself, the subordinate functions sought physical processors capable of holding them. So in each case you will be looking for a powerful computer of some kind. AETHER is the closest, and therefore might be the easiest to acquire. However… it appears to be in the middle of Tenakth territory. My knowledge of that tribe is limited to data I read on your Focus, but they seem to have a significant inclination towards violence.

Aloy: Well, that's a nice way to put it. What about POSEIDON and DEMETER?

GAIA: POSEIDON has taken shelter in the desert south of this location. My substratal geography data indicates that a major Old World settlement called Las Vegas was located there.

Aloy: A ruin in the middle of the desert, huh? Strange place for an AI devoted to water.

GAIA: Agreed. As for DEMETER… It appears to be located on the coast to the far west. Unfortunately I am unable to provide any relevant data about the region. As such, it may be the most difficult to retrieve.

Aloy: Okay. So, three subordinate functions to go after. AETHER somewhere in Tenakth territory, POSEIDON in the desert, and DEMETER on the coast.

GAIA: Where will you begin?

Aloy: I think I'll head for AETHER.

GAIA: Then I will assign AETHER as the objective on your Focus. If you obtain it, I may be able to use it to quell the most severe storms in the region. Though I will require HEPHAESTUS and the control over machines that offers to permanently stabilize the biosphere. Should you change your mind you can update your objective via your Focus interface at any time. I will also transmit a summary of available data on all of the subordinate functions to you for reference. Is there anything else I can help you with? I know you have a great deal to accomplish.

Aloy: I do, don't I.

GAIA: Is something wrong?

Aloy: Um, I don't know… it's just that Elisabet set the bar pretty high. She had a dream for you - for life on Earth. And… a lot has gone wrong. And it's all on my shoulders to fix it. Do you think I can do it all? Repair the system? Defeat Far Zenith? Live up to her example?

GAIA: Absolutely. In her last message, my predecessor declared her unwavering conviction in your success. “In you all things are possible.” You prevailed in purging HADES and rebooting my system core. You will prevail in this.

Aloy: Thank you, GAIA. Well, I uh… I guess I should get going.

GAIA: I have unlocked the facility's exits. One leads onward to the west… The other leads back down the mountain to Plainsong, should you wish to return east.

[Aloy walks away and touches her Focus.]

Aloy: Varl?

Varl: Whoa gonna have to get used to that… That you, Aloy?

Aloy: Uh… yeah. GAIA's opened the exits to this place. Can you and Zo meet me by the west door?

Varl: Be right there.

[Aloy notices a steel plate with circle radar on it.]

Aloy: GAIA, what is this?

GAIA: It is a control console for a drone-based imaging system connected to this dome. I will transmit the relevant data to your Focus.

Aloy: Huh. So this "PSICIOPS" is a network of drones to monitor the deteriorating biosphere conditions. I guess it was meant to display on the dome. But the drones aren't connected anymore. If I find the drones out in the wilds, I could get the data from them. Use it to reconnect them and restore the display.

Synthetic Voice: Error. Drone feed disconnected. Error. Drone offline.

Aloy: Okay. I need to bring AETHER back for GAIA. Varl and Zo are waiting for me by the west exit. But I could head back east first. Check on how Plainsong's doing after the attack.

[She finds Varl and Zo.]

Varl: Are you sure?

Zo: Yes. I think it'll be better this way.

Varl: After you, Aloy.

[They exit the facility to the snowy mountains.]

Aloy: I need to head further west. To, um… get more of GAIA's components. Make her stronger. You two can stay here in the meantime. GAIA can help get you up to speed. 

[Varl and Zo look at Aloy with WTF written on their faces.]

Aloy: I'm not trying to shut you out. This, it's like training.

Varl: Actually, I’m gonna go back east to get Erend. Bring him here. Look, allies - friends - can help. We have a place to stay now and like you said, GAIA can teach us, catch us up. It'll be okay.

Aloy: Okay. Take these, then.

[She hands him her pouch full of Focuses.]

Varl: One to wear, one for backup.

Aloy: While you're at it, stop by Stone's Echo and look for Milu. Give her a message for Talanah that I found a way over the mountains.

Varl: Will do.

Aloy: (to Zo) Are you going with him?

Zo: No. After what happened in the cave below… I want to stay here awhile. There is much I need to understand. Maybe by the time you get back I'll have a thing or two I can teach you.

Varl: Looking forward to it. (to Aloy)  When will you be back?

Aloy: I'm not sure. But, hopefully I’ll have one of GAIA's missing components with me.

Zo: Be careful out there. Even in Plainsong we heard how the Tenakth Clan Lands are suffering from storms, machines, and now Regalla.

Aloy: Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

Varl: Good hunting, Aloy.

[Varl and Zo leaves.]

Aloy: The Tenakth Clan Lands. Somewhere out there's three of GAIA's sub functions and who knows what else.

THE BROKEN SKY
Aloy: Brrr! Snow brought the chill.

[She sees a small tent of hides and a Tenakth girl.]

Rakka: You! Let me take a look at you, stranger! You're the outlander who stood against Regalla and her rebels.

Aloy: Only if it means were good here.

Rukka: Don't worry. I'm not here to drink your blood or whatever you Easterners think we do. The slaughter at the Embassy wasn't your fight. Yet you stood by the Marshals. As far as I'm concerned, you're no enemy of the Tenakth. But you are going to need help if you plan on surviving the Clan Lands. I hear and see many things as a scout. I could share them with you. Aid you on your journey.

Aloy: I'd be grateful.

Rukka: Well, then… was scouting northwest of here, near the village of Salt Bite. Don't know what it means but it can't be good. Be wary.

Aloy: Appreciate the warning. (to herself) Ground made of metal? It might be a Cauldron. And where there's a Cauldron, there's machine overrides.

[She saddles a Bristleback and ride to the steppes.]

Aloy: Smoke. Would be from a camp. Maybe I should check it out. Some kind of Oseram camp. How'd they end up out here? I can grab this from my stash later. I must be closing in on the signal.

[She approaches the camp.]

Porguf: Maybe if we go up and over? Can't go north… only death that way.

Corend: Looks like we have company. Why not rest for a moment, friend?

Porguf: South? Hmm. Uh-uh. More death. How about more west! Ha ha! That might… no. The heat's gettin' to ya, Porguf. Everywhere you look, more blasted mountains.

Corend: Have I got news for you, Red! Be careful if you plan on going south. A few of our delvers headed that way after we first arrived. Said they were tracking a Tallneck. Why? Never thought to ask But we haven't heard from them since.

Aloy: Thanks for the warning. (to herself) If there's a Tallneck out there, overriding it should help me get data on the surrounding area.

Signal Spike (start)
[She approaches some arguing man and woman.]

Jorund: That girl was wound up tighter than a twisted spring. She don't have to hit me!

Minda: Now she's in the wilds, all alone. Forge knows all the things that could kill her out there.

Aloy: Someone ran off?

Minda: Never got her name kept quiet. Couldn't tell if she was shy or scared. All I know is, she didn’t want anyone near her things.

Jorund: That's for sure. I was just curious, is all. She didn't have to slug me.

Minda: Your glass jaw ain't the problem, Jorund. The girl is. All alone in the bush And this is Tenakth territory.

Aloy: Which way did she go?

Minda: West, up the slope. Look for her if you can.

Aloy: I will.

Jorund: Careful now. That girl's maladjusted!

[New Side Quest - Signal Spike.]

Breaking Even
[Aloy goes to a mumbling man called Porguf.]

Corend: Dunes might look peaceful but they hide all kinds of dangers.

Aloy: Are you lost?

Porguf: Spark to steell Aren't you a jewel in a junk heap?

Aloy: Excuse me?

Porguf: Hold the hammer. I know you - you're that Nora! Ha ha! The Savior! My Savior! Right in the nick of time! The name's Porguf Delvesman. Chief delver and leader of Porguf's Expeditioners and Purveyors of Fine Delvewares.

Aloy: What am I saving you from exactly?

Porguf: Death and despair, my steel-flame friend! See, this grand expedition here has had a… a minor setback. Not far from here, there's a secret tunnel - a passage of the Old Ones - Lost and then found. Me and half the crew came through first. The other half was supposed to follow right after. But days later only one man turned up shivering like a frog  in Chillwater. Only thing we got out of him was that death and darkness chased them as the tunnel collapsed. Died with his eyes wide, he did.

Aloy: I've been to the tunnel's eastern side. The way was blocked by rubble. There was also a body-one of your delvers, guess but no sign of the rest of the crew.

Porguf: Keep your voice down will ya? The rest of the crew's already spooked. They're refusing to press on with the delve until they're assured a way out of here.

Aloy: You lost half your crew and you're worried about the delve?

Porguf: We gotta make their sacrifice worth something right? And besides, now that you're here, maybe our sand-stranded days are over. Help me get that tunnel reopened and I'll cut you in on the delvers' fee. What do you say?

Aloy: I'll see what I can do about the tunnel.

Porguf: Ha ha! My Savior!

Aloy: For the crew trapped here with you - not your delve.

Porguf: One and the same!

Aloy: That it over there?

Porguf: That it is. Oh! And while you're at it would you mind keeping an eye out for my lockbox? The second crew was supposed to bring the rest of the supplies and belongings. I'd hate to lose it to the wilds. It was hand-carved by my dear ol' ma.

Aloy: I'll bring it back if I find it.

Porguf: I'd appreciate it. Good luck, steel-flame!

[New Side Quest - Breaking Even.]

Corend: If I have to eat boar stew one more time…

[Aloy goes straight to the tunnel.]

Aloy: There's the entrance to the tunnel Porguf mentioned. I need to find his missing expedition and clear a path back east. Tunnel's blocked. And no sign of the missing expedition. I need to find a way to get further in. Should be able to blow up that Firegleam. Let's get rid of this. There's someone still alive in here!

[She finds a woman lying on the floor. She’s barely alive.]

Lunda: So you're real. Thought I was dreaming.

Aloy: What happened to you?

Lunda: A terror in the dark. The world… shuddered.

Aloy: A machine?

Lunda: Never got a look. The caravan… We all ran. Everything collapsed. Crawled here… couldn't escape. Did anyone make it out? And find the first caravan?

Aloy: Yes, someone did.

Lunda: Good. At least… I'm not alone.

[She dies.]

Aloy: Rest easy, now. Sounds like something big attacked the missing expedition. I better press on. Don't like the sound of that. Burrowers. And more of Porguf's missing expedition. 

[She attacks the machines.]

Aloy: Time to follow up! Damn. Machines called in backup! There! Let the Acid do its job! Give it a rest first. Till I get my stamina back. 

[After defeating Burrowers.]

Aloy: That Oseram… she said they were attacked by some kind of terror. I don't think it was these Burrowers. Ready for anything now. Should be able to clear that rubble with my Pullcaster. Well, that got something's attention. Sounds like it's coming from further in. Better get out of here quick! It looks like it lets out ahead. Whoa! A Rockbreaker. It must've attacked the Oseram as they were passing through.

[She defeats the giant mole-like machine.]

Aloy: Phew! Well, that's one Rockbreaker that won't be troubling anyone anymore. The Oseram must've entered the canyon on the eastern side. I better take a look. Those carts must be the supplies the second crew was supposed to bring over. Porguf said his Lockbox was supposed to be among them. Porguf's lockbox. I should take it back to him. That wall looks like it came down when the Rockbreaker attacked. It must've trapped the Oseram in the canyon. The rest must've run into the western tunnel, trying to get to the other side. I should be able to blow this up to clear the debris. Hitting those Blaze barrels with Fire ammo should do the trick.

[She destroys the wall.]

Aloy: There. A way out. The tunnel should be clear now. I better let Porguf know. I didn't see a Carja among the dead. Maybe Talanah's friend made it through. I think I'm back in No Man's Land. Now it'll be easier to go back and forth.

[She rides back to Porguf.]

Porguf: (talking to himself) Let's see. So, if we add all the days lost to being stuck in Camp Nowhere. And throw in some hazard pay 'cause no doubt the crew will demand it… But reduce the number of the crew by half… Oh, and can't forget the Savior's delvin’ fee… Huh. Might just break even. And once the delve's up and runnin’, the shards will come pouring in. (notices Aloy) You're back! How's that tunnel lookin’?

Aloy: I found the rest of your crew. One of them was still alive… for a while, anyway. Turns out a Rockbreaker attacked them as they were making their way through.

Porguf: Poor sods. Many roads lead to a delver's end, but that's got to be one of the worst.

Aloy: Well, I took care of the Rockbreaker - the way's clear now.

Porguf: Ha ha! I knew you could do it! And, uh… you didn't happen to find my lockbox, now did ya?

Aloy: Here you go.

Porguf: Spark in the dark! Is there nothing you can't do? Here, your fee as promised. Now that the threat's gone, I'll have the tunnel shored up and cleared out. Then I can send for another crew, get this expedition going proper-like. Ha! Onwards to the delve!

[“Breaking Even” Side Quest completed!]

Corend: Have I got news for you, Red! You might want to avoid going too deep into the desert. Especially the southwest. One of our scouts ran into some nasty Tenakth down there. The kind that can tame machines. He barely made it back alive.

Aloy: Thanks for letting me know. (to herself) Sounds like the rebels are as friendly as ever. I wonder what they're doing this far out in the desert?

Corend: Dunes might look peaceful, but they hide all kinds of dangers.

[Aloy continues her quest. For now she needs to find a Tallneck to make the map of the desert, the Stillsands.]

Aloy: I could use Shock ammo. Made it! Another Tallneck sending out a signal. I was told there was one around. 

[She finds several machines pierced with harpoons.]

Aloy: This looks like Useram gear. It must be the crew I heard about. The one tracking a Tallneck. What were they up to? Looks like the Oseram used some kind of harpoon to take this machine down. It must've attacked the camp. Maybe my Focus can help me figure out why. 

[Next to the downed machines lies two bodies.]

Aloy: These Oseram were killed by machines. So the one they took down wasn't alone. 

[She finds two massive metal parts on the workbench nearby.]

Aloy: These are Tallneck antennas. The Oseram must've stripped them somehow. 

[Finally, she finds a rather elaborate wooden ballista, which was used to shoot harpoons. The ballista is mounted statically on a wooden base.]

Aloy: A harpoon weapon… with anchors? Were they…? They were trying to take down that Tallneck. So the Oseram wanted to weigh down that Tallneck and strip it for parts. The machines must've caught them in the act. I wish there was a way to climb up and inspect the damage. Unless… I take down the Tallneck myself. And try to repair it on the ground. It won't be pretty. but at least it'll get fixed.

[She tries to shoot the Tallneck with the ballista.]

Aloy: Missed. I gotta hook the anchor to the Tallneck's weak spots. 

[She manages to attach a massive wooden anchor to the Tallneck with a rope. The Tallneck roars.]

Aloy: That sounds like trouble. And I need more anchors. The Oseram must've set up other ballistas in the area. I just gotta find them. Easy, Aloy. Looks like machines got to this one, too. Another ballista. And it's got one of the anchors I need. I bet a ballista can help me fight these machines. 

[She easily pierces the machines that attacked her.]

Aloy: That's useful.

[She waits for the Tallneck to finish its circle and walks up to her and shoots the anchor.]

Aloy: It's fallen! One more should weigh it down enough. More machines. I need to hurry. Machines incoming! I've already used that ballista. I should look for others in the area. There goes a piece! 

[She deals with  the machines and shoots the Tallneck third time. It falls on the sand.]

Aloy: Sorry about this, big guy. But if I can override you. I can figure out what needs fixing.

[She overrides the Tallneck, jumping on its flat head.]

Aloy: Its systems are damaged. But a reboot should fix things. Good as new.

[The Tallneck rises on its feet and Aloy jumps down on her rope. The Tallneck is fixed and Aloy gets a part of the world map! She saddles her Charger and continues her quest.]

Aloy: Sounds like there are people in trouble.

Kitakka: You, Nora! Can you assist us with these Chargers?!

[Aloy rushes into battle with the wild!]

Hataktto: That Nora’s fighting the Chargers!

Kitakka: Ihat doesn't mean you can stop fighting them!

Hataktto: We're not out of this yet.

Kitakka: Rise to the challenge!

Hataktto: Now we have a chance!

Kitakka: Watch them!

Hataktto: Hit that one, Kitakka!

Kitakka: Pick your target, take your time. Fire discipline, Hataktto!

[The battle is won.]

Aloy: That's the last of the Chargers. Let's find out what those Tenakth are doing here.

Hataktto: Yeah, yeah!

Aloy: I'm. uh… guessing you're a Tenakth patrol. How did you end up in trouble with those Chargers?

Hataktto: You need to answer our questions, we don't answer yours.

Kitakka: Hataktto, she just fought on our side.

Hataktto: That doesn't mean she's an ally.

Kitakka: That's pretty much exactly what that means. And we've enough to do chasing down these Regalla zealots without picking fights with Nora warriors.

Hataktto: Regalla's Desert Tenakth, we should be fighting alongside her instead of sitting this out.

Kitakka: Regalla has forgotten her duty and let her anger at the Carja draw us into… We will speak about this later. You fought with courage and honor. You're free to go on to the Grove, Nora.

Aloy: The Grove?

Kitakka: Our capital. If you want to spend time in this area, you'd be wise to check in with the commanders there.

[Aloy walks away and hears the Tenakth speaking in the distance.]

Hataktto: If Regalla's broken her duty then why aren't we bringing her to justice?

Kitakka: Because we follow orders. And orders are we stay neutral in this fight.

Hataktto: What sort of soldier hides from a fight?

[Aloy saddles her Charger and rides on.]

Aloy: Looks like a Cauldron, but it's offline. Seems like it has some kind of ritual importance to the Tenakth. 

[She rides onto some kind of oasis in the desert.]

Aloy: I'm getting close to AETHER's location. GAIA said it would be in some kind of physical processor. An ancient ruin… Turned into a Tenakth stronghold? Could AETHER be inside? Poking around's not gonna be easy with Tenakth warriors everywhere.

[She runs towards the entrance and hears swo Tenakth, a man and an old woman, speaking.]

Dekka: Regalla's forces may seem strong now, but--

Arorro: Her machines took out my entire squad!

Dekka: Remember the Visions. The Old Ones didn't choose their fight, but still they stood firm. They didn't falter. And neither will we.

[Arorro leaves. Aloy approaches the old woman, Dekka.]

Dekka: Blood of the Ten. You've come to us.

Aloy: You know who I am?

Dekka: (smirks) The warrior with hair like wildfire who defeated Regalla's champion at Barren Light? Yes, you are known to us. I am Dekka, Chaplain of the Lowland Clan. You've come to speak with Chief Hekarro?

Aloy: Not quite. There's… there's something I need here.

Dekka: Anything you need, the Chief will provide. Come.

Aloy: Is that one of the “Visions” you were talking about?

[She nods to a glitching hologram nearby.]

Dekka: Yes - the records of the Ten. I can show you them, if you like on the way to the Chief.

Aloy: These “Visions” - you said they're "the records of the Ten." Who are they?

Dekka: Old Ones who fought a heroic battle against machines on this very soil, long ago. Their deeds are honored in the Visions - or at least, what remains of them - to be remembered and exalted.

Aloy: There used to be more of these Visions?

Dekka: Many more. Once this place was filled with light and sound. But over the years, they've fallen into darkness, one by one. That is why Chaplains are so important to the tribe. We remember all we can of the Visions, etched in our flesh… …and passed down by word of mouth from generation to generation. One day the whole Grove may go dark. But Chaplains who come after me will keep the memories alive.

Aloy: Why does Hekarro want to see me?

Dekka: We're at war with Regalla, and you've already shown that you can stand against her.

Aloy: I'm not here to fight a war for you.

Dekka: Not for us. With us. But I won't try to persuade you - that is for the Chief. He can be very convincing.

Aloy: What does it mean to be a Chaplain here?

Dekka: We who outlast our youth study the Visions and share their wisdom with our young.

Aloy: What kind of wisdom?

Dekka: How to be a true warrior, to fight with bravery and unflinching honor and to know when to call for peace. You can see for yourself… When we go inside.

Aloy: All right. Let's go see Chief Hekarro.

Dekka: He's in his throne room, at the far end of the Grove. Come. Be welcome among the records of the Ten.

[Aloy approaches the hologram. It’s some kind of advertisement or guide now completely broken.]

Narrator: Come-- ----- -----of ---The Ten.

Aloy: It's glitched - incomplete.

Narrator: Led by -- --- ----bodies --were---weapons---for battle. ------- Dared----it all

Dekka: The Ten were dedicated soldiers, working together as a squad and sharing in their duties. And when the time came for battle, they took to the skies and leaped to glory. All Tenakth seek to follow their example. Before the Chief, it was one of the few things the clans had in common.

[Near another glitched hologram]

Narrator: ---- Ten protected ----

Air Control Romeo: Delta ---Nine you are ---free --------- engage ------ Good ------

Narrator: --- in the jungle ---sealed by -- -----darkness---trap-- their enemies.

Untalla: Ah! Play, box! You were working before.

Aloy: Soldiers in a jungle. Those were the "Ten"?

Dekka: Yes. They knew how to use the jungle's depths to distract the enemy… until the perfect moment to strike. Generations ago, my clan, the Lowland, looked to this one for inspiration as they claimed the jungle to the southwest.

Untalla: How did I get this to work last time? Hey, outlander!

[Aloy hears a broken record coming from a black box. She approaches Untalla.]

Narrator: Join thhhh-e --- Ten ---------de-de-deep--- in the ---- rain---rest.

Untalla: It's said that relicyou wear can hear the voices of the old Ones Is this true?

Aloy: You have an Old World recording?

Untalla: This box was speaking with voices of the Old Ones. But now there's noise over them.

Aloy: Let me take a look. Where did you find this?

Untalla: We took it from an Oseram delver. She was trying to steal it and other artifacts from Tenakth tentory. The others were going to bury it in the sand with her, but then I heard the voices.

Aloy: Well, the data here is badly corrupted, but…

[She fixes the black box.]

Air Control Romeo: Delta Juliet Nine you are weapons free and clear to engage the Swarm. Good hunting.

Delta Julliet Nine: Copy that. We'll bey Zero Dawn the time you need. Delta Juliet Nine out.

Untalla: The voices of warriors from the past. And that Oseram wanted to sell them for shards. The bravery of the Ten should be remembered.

Aloy: I'm not sure what you mean by "the Ten." These voices came from the final battle of the Old Ones.

Untalla: Another battle? I could learn more about it if I could find the other boxes. That delver did say there might be more recordings to be found in the wreckage of ancient flying machines.

Untalla: She claimed she had a way to locate them.

Aloy: Yeah. The box with the voice data on it is emitting a locator signal. I could use it to find the others.

Untalla: If you do then bring them back here. I will see to it that they’re treated with proper respect. Whatever sacrifices were made by these ancient soldiers, we will honor them. Let me know when you have one that you’ll part with.

Aloy: Do you get many Oseram delvers in Tenakth territory?

Untalla: Fewer every time we catch them. But those thieving rats would do anything for the shards. There'll always be some who'll risk coming here.

Aloy: And what do you do with the ones you catch?

Untalla: Delvers spend their lives in the dust. So we bury them in it. Alive.

Aloy: Why do you want these recordings?

Untalla: Every battle teaches its soldiers. We should learn those lessons. And honor those who fell. That is our way.

Aloy: If I find more of those recordings, I'll bring them back to you.

[She continues to explore the stronghold.]

Aloy: My Focus can detect beacons from those recording devices. Should help me to find any others that are still out there.

Narrator: ---The-Ten --- inh---own the mountain----------- Outlast -- ------any---- Climb--- The Ten ----- defend - -- the----mountain--

Dekka: During their wear the trend limbed sheer rock braving blinding snow and wind. They stopped at nothing to protect their own.

Aloy: You make them sound invincible.

Dekka: They weren't. But the visions tell us of their courage and strength. Something our soldiers aspire to. The Sky Clan admires this one above all the rest. They make their home in the mountains northwest of here.

Narrator: ------- Ten ccc---cc-claimed ---------the desert. The Ten seized-----the desert. ----Others fear----th-th-their rage. ----Sand-- soldiers-------ripppping enemy ---- lines.

Aloy: What's this one about?

Dekka: The Ten waged war against their enemy in the desert heat - a land too harsh for any to survive. But against all odds, they prevailed. So the Desert Clan does the same. You must’ve passed through their territory on the way here.

Aloy: I did. They sound a little… extreme.

Dekka: They'd take that as a compliment.

Aloy: Are you the only one listening to these voices?

Untalla: Oh, no. The others who captured the Oseram delver heard the voices from these ancient warriors, too. They spread the word and now a lot of people are talking about them. Soldiers are interested in old battles a interested in old battles.

Aloy: I hope you find what you want from these recordings.

[Finally Dekka shows Aloy the Chief’s throne room.]

Dekka: The Chief is inside. Are you ready to see him?

Aloy: I'm ready.

Dekka: Good. Come.

[Dekka asks Aloy to wait and leaves to call the Chief. Aloy scans the room and sees a large hall beneath the throne.]

Aloy: It's underneath the throne.

[Dekka and Kotallo approaches.]

Kotallo: I will see you soon, outlander.

[He leaves in a gloomy mood. The Chief Hekarro regally enters the throne room. He is a man of sturdy build, adorned with many tattoos and expertly crafted light armor.]

Hekarro: The Savior of Meridian. I am told you held back Regalla's forces outside Barren Light and defeated her champion Grudda in single combat. Impressive.

Aloy: I met Fashav there, too. He said you were a great warrior - and a man of honor.

Hekarro: His death is a painful loss among many. We will not soon recover from the massacre of our Marshals. But if you are here to pledge your service, that could help considerably.

Aloy: I am not here to fight for you. I need something in that basement. Something that will save many lives, yours included. It's not something you can see, but it is there--

Hekarro: I have seen it. You have named your price. Now I name mine. With my Marshals dead, I need your spear. Help me defeat my enemies and I will grant you access to the chamber below.

Aloy: I don't have a price. I am not a hired killer. I'm here to save lives. More than you can count.

Hekarro: I count the corpses of Marshals slain. I count hundreds more Tenakth whose lives hang in the balance. I will fight for them. I will kill anyone who threatens the peace. And you will too. If you want me to open the door to the chamber below.

Aloy: Okay. So by that logic, what's stopping me from killing you right now and taking what I need to save everyone?

Hekarro: You could try. You might even succeed. Either way, you must fight. My way might hold off Regalla and the slaughter she craves.

Aloy: Fine. What do you need?

Hekarro: I need more Marshals to keep the tribe together. Such warriors can only be promoted at a trial-by-combat called the Kulrut. I have sent out a call for the competition. But since Regalla seeks to undermine me she is certain to attack it. She'll want to kill me in front of the assembled clans.

Aloy: So, what you want me to be your bodyguard?

Hekarro: No. To defend the Kulrut. But there is more. Knowing that Regalla will attack, one of the clans has balked at sending their contestants. You must go north and force Tekotten, the commander of the Sky Clan, to submit and send his best.

Aloy: "Force him to submit"?

Hekarro: Do whatever is necessary. I can't hold the Kulrut with two of the three clans in attendance. Marshal Kotallo will assist you. He was maimed at Barren Light, but he can still be of use. I sent him ahead to the northern village of Stone Crest. Meet him there and he will guide you to the Sky Clan stronghold. If you have any questions about your mission, now is the time.

Aloy: Fashav called Regalla your greatest mistake. Why?

Hekarro: That is not your concern.

Aloy: Really? I fought against her forces at Barren Light, and I don't even know what her problem is.

Hekarro: She… was the deadliest of my Marshals. The point of my spear.

Aloy: So, what happened?

Hekarro: Above all, Regalla despises the Carja, who burned her younger brothers alive. After we turned back the Red Raids and tore down the battlements of Barren Light, she hoped to chase them all the way to Meridian. She could not see the cost of such a war. Nor the benefits of peace, after the Mad Sun-King fell. When I accepted Avad's entreaties, she went mad. Called me traitor. Challenged me before the Marshals.

Aloy: What did you do when Regalla challenged you?

Hekarro: If you were Tenakth you would know that such a challenge cannot be refused. It was not easy to subdue her. I bear seven scars from that fight. The other Marshals wanted me to execute her on the spot. But I found I could not sever the bond between us. Her loyalty had been as boundless as her rage. So I spared her. Rather than mercy, she took it as a humiliation. One she will never be free from.

Aloy: So, Regalla wants you dead?

Hekarro: She does. But that will not be enough. She won't rest until all three clan's fall in behind her as she marches on Meridian. Who knows? With machines under her control perhaps she can raze it to the ground.

Aloy: It's been tried before.

Hekarro: So I hear.

Aloy: I'm sorry about Fashav. He seemed like a good man.

Hekarro: More than a man. A bridge between Tenakth and Carja. No outlander ever earned our respect as he did. I had hoped he would be my voice in Meridian. That peace with the Carja might become something more.

Aloy: An alliance? 

Hekarro: An exchange. The Carja have much we lack. Our deeds are written in ink upon our bodies. Our memories die with our flesh. But the Carja never forget. Their deeds are written in book and scroll.

Aloy: You wanted to learn from them?

Hekarro: As I learned from Fashav. He will be missed.

Aloy: What exactly is the Kulrut?

Hekarro: Where once the clans fought each other, now we fight as one… against the machines. That is my law, made manifest in the Kulrut. Each clan must send contestants whenever I call for the ritual. These contestants face trial-by-combat against machines in an arena just beyond these walls. Those who distinguish themselves become Marshals, who bind the tribe together as peacekeepers.

Aloy: You called them peacekeepers, but the Marshals I met at the Embassy were warriors.

Hekarro: Warriors, yes. But more. They renounce the clan that birthed them and pledge themselves to order and peace. They enforce my law. They settle disputes. And stand for Tenakth in parley with other tribes. Without them, I cannot rule. Which is why you must ensure the next Kulrut takes place.

Aloy: Why won't the Sky Clan send contestants to the Kulrut?

Hekarro: Of the three clans, they have the most defensible base, protected by a mighty wall called the Bulwark. Their commander believes he can wait out the war between Regalla's forces and my own, safe behind his barrier.

Aloy: Staying strong while you and Regalla weaken each other.

Hekarro: You think like a seasoned Marshal. Good.

Aloy: Why send me to deal with the Sky Clan?

Hekarro: All Tenakth respect strength. And you drove Regalla back at Barren Light.

Aloy: That and most of your Marshals are dead?

Hekarro: Correct.

Aloy: What about Kotallo? Can't he do it by himself?

Hekarro: He is maimed. They will no longer respect him.

Aloy: That hardly seems fair.

Hekarro: What is fair about losing an arm? Whether they respect him or not, Kotallo still has worth. He knows the Sky Clan. He was raised in their base. He will guide you well.

Aloy: You said you saw what's in the basement?

Hekarro: I did. On the day of my greatest victory.

Aloy: What do you mean?

Hekarro: For a dozen generations, the three clans battled for control of this hallowed ground. Only I achieved it. I fought for years. Killed whoever stood in my way. When I had finally stain all rivals, I stood alone in the Grove. Victory was mine to savor. Or so I thought. Thunder roared from the east. And a bolt of blue struck this place. That chamber.

Aloy: GAIA dies, and AETHER arrives.

Hekarro: All around me, the Visions of the Grove grew louder and brighter. And suddenly a new one appeared before me. The Old Ones spoke. And what they said changed everything.

Aloy: What did the Old Ones say to you in this new vision?

Hekarro: The one called Faraday foretold the growing danger of the machines, and said we must unify to stop them. She called for Marshals to enforce the peace. Then the vision faded, never to be seen again. I marked the spot where it shone with my spear. And I took Faraday's words to heart. Renounced war between the clans. Trained warriors to fight machines. Ordained Marshals through the Kulrut. Since then, the tribe has been at peace… until Regalla attacked at Barren Light.

Aloy: And the chamber beneath the throne. You went in after the Vision?

Hekarro: I did. Inside is an ancient device. It hums with power. You will see it for yourself after the Kulrut. This I swear.

Aloy: I'll do what you want and go north to deal with Tekotteh. But you'd better not forget about our deal.

Hekarro: You will have what was promised. If you succeed. Speak to Dekka on your way out. She will arm you for the road ahead.

[Aloy leaves the throne room.]

Dekka: Come. Let us speak.

Aloy: Hekarro said you have something for me?

Dekka: A weapon to aid your mission. You'll need it for the long road to Stone Crest. Many machines prowl along the way. And our scouts have sighted Regalla's rebels in the area.

Aloy: Machines and rebels. Nothing I haven't faced before.

Dekka: Indeed. Head north, towards the foothills. Ascend its slopes until your legs burn and the chill air catches in your chest. Then you'll know you're in the Sky Clan's domain. Strike true as the Ten, Aloy.

[Aloy got Tear Precision Arrows. She leaves the stronghold.]

Aloy: If I'm going to get AETHER, guess it have to play along with Hekarro. I better meet up with Marshal Kotallo at Stone Crest. It'll be faster if I ride a machine.

[Aloy rides till nightfall. She finds a Vista Point hologram.]

Aloy: This image is of the Old World! Looks like a plane and some kind of metal structure. Hup! I think the image was taken overlooking a field. Maybe I could try to line it up… somewhere in.the nearby hills? That metal structure looks like the one in the image. I think I might be close to where it was taken. That did it!

[She finds a hermit nearby.]

Uvveh: You there! Over here! You're the champion come from out east. I've heard of your deeds in battle. My people owe you a debt. And so I'll share what I know of this land with you. There's much I see and hear that might help you in your travels. For example… Did you know that wherever you go in the Clan Lands. There's an ancient tower north of here. I've heard rumors that relics have been sighted there, but it could just be idle chatter.

Aloy: Maybe I'll have a look.

Uvveh: That's the spirit.

[Aloy spends the night with the hermit and hits the road in the early morning.]

Aloy: My fingers feel stiff in this cold.

[She climbs on the top of a snowy mountain and the jumps off of it on her hologlider.]

Aloy: Ground's getting steeper, air's getting cold. Should be getting close to Stone Crest.

[She approaches some buildings.]

Tenakth Soldier: Not one more step. The Tenakth don't suffer outlanders in the Clan Lands.

Aloy: I was given right of passage by Marshal Fashav. I'm not here to fight.

Tenakth Soldier 2: Hair like blood. This is the warrior who defeated Grudda, champion of the traitor Regalla. Her life is not ours to take. You may enter But mind our ways. You will be watched.

Aloy: I’ll keep that in mind.

[She walks into the village.]

Aloy: This must be Stone Crest. Kotallo should be waiting for me. But maybe I should look around first.

[She finds Katallo on a market.]

Aloy: There's Kotallo. What's he looking at?

Terakka: What you've done for my people is known throughout the Clan Lands, Easterner. I'd like to help you if I can Lending you my eyes and ears. Nothing happens in this area without me knowing about it! In fact, I should tell you… They say you're a skilled fighter, outlander. But I wonder how well you'd do against Erayyo, one of our combat trainers at the Bulwark.

Aloy: Pretty sure I can hold my own… But there's always room to learn.

Terakka: Well said. Pay Erayyo a visit, if you can.

Aloy: Maybe I will.

[She approaches Kotallo who is just sitting on the edge of a cliff with a stone in his hand. Kotallo lost his arm in the Regalla incident. Below them there's a camp.]

Kotallo: This valley is infested with Regalla's rebels. The scouts from the village tell us that they've been moving machines through here for days. Some they ride. Others they herd along and some they even strip for parts, especially cannons. The path ahead will not be easy. We should get going. My orders are to guide you to the Bulwark so that you can speak to Tekotteh. For all the good it'll do.

Aoy: Not so fast. I'm going to need a little more than that. What is this place?

Kotallo: Stone Crest was built as an outpost back when the clans were still at way. Its purpose was to guard the entrance to the valley as well as keep watch on what happens below. For now, that means keeping watch on Regalla's forces. I wish we had enough soldiers to do more than just look on.

Aloy: "For all the good it'll do"? What's that supposed to mean?

Kotallo: The Bulwark has stood unyielding since the birth of our clan. Behind it, Tekotteh believes himself to be invulnerable. If he insists on defying Hekarro's orders… An outlander and a maimed Marshal aren't going to change his mind.

Aloy: Your Chief seems to think differently.

Kotallo: And that is the only reason I am still standing here talking to you.

Aloy: What makes the Bulwark so impenetrable?

Kotallo: It's made of massive boulders, impervious to any frontal assault. No army or machine has ever penetrated it. I am the only thing that can get you inside. If we're done talking, that is.

Aloy: What makes you so sure Tekotten won't listen to us?

Kotallo: A snake safe in its lair hears nothing but its own rattle.

Aloy: Come on, is that all you’ve got for me? Hekarro said you were from the Sky Clan before becoming a Marshal. I need to know what you know.

Kotallo: Tekotteh is a petty, vindictive schemer. If he had any guts held have gone after Hekarro long ago. But instead, he covets the Chiefdom from behind the Bulwark, biding his time. Hoping that his foes will weaken one another. Is that enough for you?

Aloy: For now. Why do you think Regalla's forces are driving machines through the valley?

Kotallo: We've heard similar reports from across the Clan Lands. The rebels are gathering machines from the wilds. But whatever control they have over them doesn't seem to last. So they herd them into camps. Something else happens there, something that makes their control permanent.

Aloy: I've been to their camps. You're right - they have equipment that can establish a lasting override.

Kotallo: May the Ten help us all. But it gets worse. We’ve heard rumors that the rebels are stouting larger machines. I don't know what kind.

Aloy: Let's hope they don't learn how to override them too. You were at the Embassy.

Kotallo: I was.

Aloy: I'm sorry about the other Marshals.

Kotallo: Their deaths will not go unpunished. (silent groan)

Aloy: You're still healing.

Kotallo: I will never "heal." But that won't stop me from cracking any skulls that need it.

Aloy: Good thing you're on my side, then. So, what's the plan?

Kotallo: The Bulwark is to the southwest. So undoubtedly we'll have to cross paths with Regalla's troops along the way. We'll either have to fight our way through or find a way to sneak past unnoticed. Neither will be easy.

Aloy: Never is.

Kotallo: (smirks) Let's get this over with. On me.

[Aloy follows Kotallo.]

Aloy: How would you convince Tekotten to send his challengers?

Kotallo: I wouldn't.

Aloy: (sighs) Come on.

Kotallo: Tenakth respects a blade and the strength of the fighter who wields it. What good is anyone who lacks that?

Aloy: Well, lucky for us we’re both good fighters. But let's hope it won't come to that. 

Kotallo: Hmph.

Aloy: So the whole valley is the Sky Clan’s territory?

Kotallo: Yes. The clan has defended it for generations.

Aloy: Against who?

Kotallo: The other Tenakth clans. Even the Carja, long ago. If you want a history lesson, talk to the Chaplains. Rebels ahead. Hacking away at that machine. Gut them or sneak around. I will follow.

[Aloy sneaks up on a group of rebels.]

Aloy: The world always seems quieter when it snows.

Rebel Soldier: Hurry it up. We need to rejoin the others.

[She kills the bulky one with a shield and quickly finishes off the others. Kotallo helps her.]

Kotallo: Dead. Good. Onwards to the Bulwark.

Aloy: Those rebels were gathering machine pants… maybe to make more overrides. And Tekotteh won't do anything?

Kotallo: Why would he, when he has the Bulwark? I grew up behind the wall. It's easy to have a false sense of safety there. More rebels in the clearing. Take the lead. They're done. Now let's go. Come. This way.

Aloy: Back at Stone Crest, you said the rebels have been moving through here for days. By the time Tekotteh realizes he's outmatched this entire valley might be overrun.

Kotallo: If not for the sake of the rest of the clan, I would welcome that way. To see his pride ruined. Here is - the Bulwark. Let me know when you are ready and I will announce us.

[Aloy checks her equipment and crafts more ammo. Kotallo trumpets a small horn that echoes through the snowy mountains.]

Kotallo: You there. A Marshal requests an audience with your clan commander!

Tenakth Guard: I didn't know there were any Marshals left. We defend the path to the mountain…

Kotallo: …where the Wings of the Ten shall find us.

Tenakth Guard: All right, Marshal. I'll send the lift for you.

[Kotallo and Aloy get into the elevator, which slowly begins to rise to the top.]

Kotallo:When we meet with Tekotten, I'll do the talking.

Aloy: We'll see how it goes.

[They enter Bulwark.]

Kotallo: Back again.

Aloy: So, this was home.

Kotallo: A long time ago. Come on.

Tenakth Soldier: Is that Kotallo? What's he doing with an outlander?

Tenakth Soldier: Such a terrible wound.

Tenakth Soldier: The last Marshal.

Tenakth Soldier: Why'd they let an outlander in here?

Aloy: Well, this is a warm welcome.

Kotallo: An outlander and a maimed Marshal… A spectacle.

Aloy: Reminds me of where I grew up. I never decided which was worse when they shunned me or when they stopped and stared.

Kotallo: Right now, I'd prefer shunned. This is it. Ready? (to the guard) We're here for Tekotteh. Let us in.

[They enter the throne room, or I must say, the throne cave. Several savage looking people are eating and talking.]

Tekotten: The Sky Clan's mighty son returns. Bless the Ten.

Kotallo: Your Chief has demanded an immediate dispatch of all challengers to the Kulrut. We're here to make sure yours haven't gotten lost on their way to the Grove.

Tekotteh: I see. Regalla must have dealt our Chief a mighty blow if he's sending you two as messengers.

Kotallo: This one defeated Regalla's champion Grudda at the Embassy. She fought honorably.

Tekotteh: I had the sense to bar our soldiers from that Embassy. Just as I have the sense now to keep our challengers here. If they must fight, then they will fight here. Defending our walls, our clan.

Aloy: That wall won't protect you. Not from the machines Regalla controls. They're already at your doorstep.

Tekotteh: (smirks) And what do you know of the battles that the Bulwark has withstood? The blood shed upon stone?

Kotallo: I know it wasn't meant to be used as a coward's shield.

[Tekotteh rises from his throne and walks to Kotallo.]

Tekotteh: You were a great warrior once. (pats Kotallo on the stump) But that was then. You tell Hekarro, with all due respect. That we will keep our challengers here… …for as long as we are safe behind the Bulwark.

[Aloy and Kotallo leave the throne cave.]

Kotallo: I told you - words are useless with his kind. We're going to have to kill him. It won't be easy with all his men about… Are you even listening?

Aloy: "For as long as we are safe behind the Bulwark" he said… Wait here. I need to get a closer look at that wall.

Kotallo: What? Why?

Aloy: That wall might not be as strong as Tekotten thinks it is. I need to get down to the base of it and check it out. Snow's melting on my clothes. Great.

Tenakth Guard: Beaten already, outlander?

Aloy: Just you wait.

[She jumps down the wall with her hologlider.]

Aloy: I need to get a little distance from the wall in order to scan it properly. Okay. Time to scan the wall. Just what I thought. There’s something metal in there. Hmm. All that rock is interfering with the scan I need to get closer. But how? I might be able to climb up on the left side of the wall near that waterfall. 

[She approaches the waterfall in the wall.]

Aloy: Where's this water coming from? 

[She climbs up the waterfall.]

Aloy: Water's flowing into the wall. Towards a hollow, maybe? Rocks here might give way if I pry at them. Now - better scan that tank again. A power core. I'll bet if I blew it up… but how? Well. Can't do anything else here. Better go find Katallo.

[She returns to Kotallo who stands near the elevator.]

Kotallo: The guards said you've been scurrying around the wall like a rat. What in the name of the Ten have you been up to?

Aloy: Tekotteh said he wouldn't send his challengers as long as they're safe behind the Bulwark, right?

Kotallo: Don't remind me.

Aloy: So… we take it down.

Kotallo: Did you hit your head on the way down here?

Aloy: I'm serious. There's something from the Old World stuck in there. And it has a power cell. I could blow it up if I just penetrate the first layer of rock and metal.

Kotallo: Even if what you're saying is true, it would take a cannon to do that -

Aloy: You're right! And you said the rebels were stripping them off machines back in the valley! Come on!

Kotallo: No. I'm not getting dragged further into this madness.

Aloy: Hekarro ordered you to help me. You gonna defy him like that arrogant shit up there? (walks away)

Kotallo: (sighs) That was an unkind comparison.

[He follows Aloy.]

Aloy: The rebels might have made camp northeast of here.

Katallo: And then what? The two of us go up against all of them?

Aloy: Pretty much, yeah.

Kotallo: Well, you may lack sense but you don't lack courage.

Aloy: So, um, back there, with Tekotteh… it seems like there's bad blood between you two.

Kotallo: There is. If we make it through this. plan of yours, perhaps I'll tell you.

Aloy: I’ll hold you to that.

Kotallo: We're getting close to where we saw the rebels before.

[They hide in the high grass.]

Aloy: Well, it looks like the rebels just got a lot more fewer.

[They have… and elephant. Mechanical that is. The elephant rampaging a little but the driver manages to calm it down.]

Rebel Captain: Ready! Move out!

Kotallo: You wanted your cannon and that thing has them. This won’t be easy to take down especially with this. (touches his stump)

Aloy: I’ll handle the big guy. You focus on the others.

Kotallo: I'll follow you in.

Aloy: Frost will hurt it. That ice ought to make it brittle! 

[Epic fight depicted in the Collector’s Edition figurine begins!]

Aloy: Got them all. So, about that cannon… 

[She tears one of the massive guns from the elephant.]

Aloy: Not looking forward to hauling this all the way to the Bulwark.

Kotallo: Here. I may be maimed, but I've still got a strong back. 

[Not without some effort Kotallo hauls the gun on his back and holds it with one hand. Aloy looks at him with compassion.]

Kotallo: After you.

[On the way back to Bulwark.]

Aloy: Hey. You fought well back there.

Kotallo: I did not think we'd survive. But killing the rebels and their machine… it was good to take the fight to them, for once. Do you really think this… thing will do the job?

Aloy: We'll know soon enough. I wonder how much snow's going to pile up.

Kotallo: Here it is. But you don't just need a cannon. You need a miracle.

Aloy: Coming right up. Okay. Gotta blast away some rocks so I can expose the power cell.

[She shoots the wall with bursts of energy.]

Aloy: It's working.

Kotallo: Nothing's exploding. This isn't going to work.

[Tekotteh looks at them from the top.]

Tekotteh: Well, isn't this impressive? Two children playing siege! I hope they haven't hurt the Bulwark's feelings! Come now, stop embarrassing yourselves and leave this poor mountain alone!

Aloy: This is your last chance, Tekotteh! You can still answer Hekarro's call.

Tekotteh: This is your last chance. You have it backwards. Leave this place, savage. Now. And take this cripple with you. 

[Aloy nods to Kotallo and blows the wall to pieces.]

Tekotteh: What have you done?

Aloy: Can't hide behind the wall any more, Tekotteh. Now you have to join Hekarro!

Tekotteh: Never! Never! We will… rebuild it! Immediately!

Kotallo: You are not safe! The Bulwark couldn't protect you from a single cannon, let alone an army of machines! The only pathway to safety is to unite against Regalla with your Chief! You decreed that no challengers would be sent while the clan remained safe behind the Bulwark. So send them now. Unless your word means nothing?

Tekotteh: Send them.

Kotallo: I didn't hear you!

Tekotteh: Send the challengers.

Kotallo: I look forward to seeing the Sky Clan's colors in the Arena.

Aloy: Nicely done, Marshal. What's going to happen to this place?

Kotallo: They'll have to live without their wall. But that's better than living apart from the tribe as pawns in Tekotteh's foolish schemes. If you want to check up on them, talk to Gerrah, the Chaplain of the clan. If anyone needs help up there, she'll know.

Aloy: Yeah. Maybe I will.

Kotallo: I'll take my leave, then. I need to report to Hekarro.

Aloy: I'll see you at the Kulrut.

Kotallo: Good. We may need another miracle there as well.

[“THE BROKEN SKY” mission completed!]

Aloy: Not sure where to get the parts I need. I'll have to explore more machine sites. Maybe I should go up there, see if everyone's all right. And find this Chaplain, Gerrah. Might also be a good idea to resupply before I head back out.

THE KULRUT
Errand: Call and Response (start)
[Aloy finds Gerrah as Kotallo told her.]

Gerrah: Come, huntress. You and I should speak.

Aloy: Are you Chaplain Gerrah? Kotallo said should talk to you to see if you need help.

Gerrah: Bold move, Wall-breaker, burying Tekotten's pride beneath the Bulwark's rubble.

Aloy: I was just—

Gerrah: At ease. Many in the clan agree with you. And Marshal Kotallo was right to send you to me. There is something you can help with. A few of our soldiers followed him to the Embassy at Barren Light. Against Tekotten's orders.

Aloy: Right. I remember Kotallo showed up last. With only a few representatives from the Sky Clan.

Gerrah: When those soldiers returned home, Tekotteh re-assigned them to an old watchtower. One we had abandoned to the machines. He insisted that with war brewing, it must be reclaimed. But those soldiers are serving no one out there. If, however, they were to return by request of Hekarro’s Champion… Tekotteh wouldn't have the backing to deny them. Especially when their Chaplain supports their return. 

Aloy: Tell a few soldiers to come home and give Tekotteh another black eye. Sounds easy enough.

Gerrah: Go to the Cold Rushes, a long stretch to the west. The watchtower stands beside the falls. Speak to Kivva there, the squad's leader. Good luck.

[New errand begins - Call and Response.]

A Soldier’s March (start)
Aloy: What's going on here?

Litakka: The Wall-breaker! Jekkah's brother here went off to get himself killed.

Jekkah: He'll finish the climb. I know it.

Litakka: Not likely.

Jekkah: My brother Penttoh left to climb the March of the Ten. To get his soldier's mark. They were supposed to be done by now. But he's not back yet.

Squad Leader: Jekkah! Litakka! To your training! Now!

Litakka: Your brother should've stuck to his cleaning duties. (runs away)

Jekkah: Would you… mind checking up on the March? If I leave, my squad leader will kick my ass. And I don't want anyone thinking I'm worried about my brother making the climb. Because I'm not.

Aloy: I get it.

Jekkah: You can't miss the path markers. They're by the waterfall west of here.

Aloy: If I head that way, I'll see what's going on.

Jekkah: Thank you.

Squad Leader: No slacking, soldier!

[Jekkah runs away too. New Side Quest begins - A Soldier’s March.]

The Kulrut (continue)
Aloy: The Kulrut should be starting soon. Once it's done, I'll be able to access the chamber below Hekarro's throne… and AETHER. This must lead to the Arena. It's another part of the ruins. Turned into a fighting ring.

[She approaches Hekarro and Kotallo, standing on a platform above the arena.]

Hekarro: Look at them all. They know a battle is coming.

Kotallo: Regalla can try all she likes. We'll crush her.

[Aloy getting close.]

Hekarro: Aloy. It seems you had to move mountains to bring the Sky Clan to heel… literally.

Aloy: Kotallo helped.

Hekarro: Yes. Tekotteh reprimanded for all the clan to see. You've both served well. But now the Kulrut is at hand. Some have come to compete. Others to bear witness. They know Regalla will come for me.

Aloy: I’ll do whatever takes to hold up my end, as long as you remember yours. So, what's the plan?

Hekarra: Kotallo.

Kotallo: There are only two viable ways to attack the Arena: through the throne room you just passed and by the trail on the north end. We've set up barricades at both. But if Regalla means to assault the Kulrut with machines, she will have to attack by the trail.

Hekarro: You will join our defenders there. Hold the line, and I have my Marshals. You will be free of my service and receive your reward. Make whatever preparations you must. Once the Kulrut begins, you must see it through.

Aloy: The Grove, the Arena - it's all part of the same ancient structure?

Hekarro: Yes. Here the land remembers the sacrifice of the Ten, their deeds commemorated for eternity.

Aloy: Sacrifice?

Hekarro: Visions tell us that on the ground below they gave their lives in a fight against machines. We honor them by holding the Kulrut where they fell.

Aloy: I know where I'll be. What about you two?

Kotallo: I will be here with the Chief, where I belong. Should the fight reach us, we will take the blood owed for our fallen.

Hekarro: If it comes to that. The defenses wilthold.

Aloy: Let's get this over with.

Hekarro: Good. You'll find ekka at the north barricade with the rest of our defenders. Strike true as the Ten. I'll see you when this is done.

[Aloy prepares for the difficult fight and shops for some supplies after which she sees a familiar face.]

Tekatteh: Easterner. 

Aloy: Didn't think the Sky commander himself would be joining us today.

Tekatteh: (stands up) If there's a chance my challengers will be facing Regalla… It is only right their commander join in their fate.

Aloy: Or maybe you need to save face after what happened at the Bulwark.

Tekotten: Careful now. Sometimes sharp wits bring out sharp spears.

Aloy: I'd save my spear for Regalla's troops if I were you.

[She glides down to the arena and runs to one of the exits.]

Aloy: Okay. Hekarro's defenders should be at the end of this trench.

Dekka: Focus on the machines. Take them down and Regalla's forces become no different from our own.

Tenakth Soldier: Yes, Chaplain.

Dekka: Watch each other's backs. Dismissed. (to Aloy) Our soldiers are ready. They will defend the Kulrut from below. But from above…

Aloy: Not bad. Where did you get it?

Dekka: One of our squads ripped it off a fallen machine. The honor is yours. Regalla may have her tricks… But you will show her our teeth.

[They hear cheering from the arena, on which several machines are tied to stacks. A lot of people gathered. The Kulrut begins! Hekarro speaks to his warriors from the platform.]

Hekarro: Tenakth! The Kulrut is upon us! Our struggle demands new blood. New leaders! Release the quarry!

[The archers shoot at the ropes, releasing the machines.]

Hekarro: Challengers! Approach! All who take down a machine shall be named Remember the Ten. Strike from the air as they did and seize your glory!

[The challengers repel down to the arena. They start fighting. Aloy is looking into the distance and sees machines approaching the arena.]

Aloy: Here they come!

[She picks up a heavy gun.]

Dekka: Hold them back! Defend the Kurut! Keep firing, Aloy! Let no machine through. Strike back! Protect the Arena! Push through! Just a few stragglers left! Nice hit!

[Meanwhile the fight in the arena ends and the challengers cheer in victory.]

Aloy: That can't be all of them.

Dekka: There! What is that?

Aloy: I don't know.

[Something bursts out of the ground, destroying the protective structures.]

Tenakth Soldier: Get out of the way!

Aloy: Hold the defenses!

Dekka: Go!

[Aloy runs towards the arena. Massive mole-like machine bursts out of the ground and attacks the Chief’s platform. Kotallo saves him.]

Kotallo: Chief!

[Regalla’s soldiers climb out of the hole made by their mole-like machine. They climb onto the platforms and kill Hekarro soldiers. Aloy is about to follow them, but a Slitherfang appears from the hole in the ground and kills one of the soldiers.]

Aloy: Get to the weapon! If I can draw that thing close, open fire! (throws a rock) Hey! That's right over here, you big worm!

[She starts fighting the Slitherfang.]

Aloy: Just need a rib from that Fanghorn they were talking about.

[Meanwhile Ivvira finds the gun.]

Ivvira: I'm in position! Let’s bring this thing down! Firing! That hit its mark! Reloading! Keep its attention! Lining up the shot. Firing! That hit its mark! Hold on, Champion! We're reloading! Lining up the shot! Take that machine. Hold on Champion! We're reloading!

[Eventually, the heroes manage to defeat the monster.]

Aloy: Finally, I hate those things. Regalla went after Hekarro and Kotallo. I gotta get to them.

[Aloy runs to the throne room.]

Ivvira: Champion! Get to the Chief!

Tenakth Soldier: Go! Get to the Chief. We've got this!

Tenakth Soldier: We'll defend the hall. Help the Chief.

Tenakth Soldier: The Chief's in the throne room! Stop Regalla!

[Aloy runs into the throne room to see Kotallo and Hekarro fighting Regalla, and does not notice that the ceiling of the throne room is crumbling. Aloy grabs part of the column with her rope.]

Aloy: Kotallo!

[Kotallo saves Hekarro from Regalla. Other Hekarro’s soldiers run in.]

Regalla: This isn't finished. I'll be back with everything I have… …and all who stand with Hekarro will be run red!

Hekarro: At attention. You fought well. Proved yourselves against enemies both metal and flesh. I name you all “Marshal.” Your first order is to secure the Arena from any remaining rebels, Go.

[The Marshals leave the throne room.]

Hekarro: I failed. I should have finished Regalla. But now she'll be back with more machines, stronger than ever.

Aloy: I'll do what I can to help.

Hekarro: No, you've done enough - far more than our bargain called for. When we first met, you spoke of your true mission on which all depends. I wasn't certain if I believed you then. But I believe in you now. So leave me and get to your task.

Aloy: What will you do?

Hekarro: Tend to the wounds. What you need is there. Take it. Your deeds today will be remembered like those of the Ten.

[He and Kotallo walk away. Aloy pushes a button near the throne and opens a secret hatch.]

Aloy: This is it AETHER's below. What was this place? There. That console. Come on, AETHER. Time to go home.

AETHER: Home. GAIA.

Aloy: (overriding) Yes. Elisabet Sobeck. Alpha Prime.

Synthetic Voice: Master Override Activated. Restoring AETHER subordinate function to original code.

Aloy: Got it. Now to get this back to GAIA.

[She hearch Dekka’s voice from above.]

Dekka: The Visions in the Grove have changed! The words of the Ten are now clear to us. Here. This must be the vision that Chief Hekarro saw years ago. All of the Visions are changed. And this one just… arrived. 

[Aloy climbs to the throne room and approaches Dekka.]

Dekka: The Visions throughout the Grove are different now. And this one… it just appeared. Is this your doing?

Tekatteh: The Visions have changed!

Ivvira: That's the one that inspired Chief Hekarro…

Kotallo: More testimony of the Old Ones?

[Dekka activates the console. A hologram of a few people appears.]

Narrator: Hear now the words that reunited a people. Following the tragic events of the war. Anne Faraday, the chief architect of the reconciliation effort, addressed a nation in need of hope.

Faraday: If we look into the future through the lens of the recent past, our fears loom. Wars waged against machines. Starcity of food and water. Storms that drive us from our homes. But true courage means facing those fears with conviction instead of cynicism. Leading the peacekeeping effort with these brave men and women, these "Marshals" of the new southwest… …has strengthened my conviction that when we are united, we can overcome any threat. Join me - join us - in that conviction, as we strive for a nation and a world without want or war.

[Human holograms salute Faraday’s hologram. Tenakths do the same. The record ends.]

Kotallo: (to Aloy) Reporting for duty, commander. I'm coming with you.

Aloy: But Hekarro needs you--

Kotallo: Because of you, he has new Marshals… and a rallying cry the clans cannot ignore. So, I will stand with you on your mission. Give whatever is left of my life. It is what I choose.

Aloy: How can I say no to that? (via Focus) Zo - there's someone who wants to join us. I need you to meet him in the foothills and guide him the rest of the way.

Zo: (via Focus) Will do, Aloy.

Aloy: Go to the mountains west of Plainsong. A friend of mine will meet you on the ascent. I'll join you when I can.

Kotallo: A friend of yours? Should be interesting.

Aloy: All right, I need to get AETHER back to GAIA. Seems like capturing it did something to the other holograms, too. Might be worth checking out.

[She returns to The Base. Varl tries to teach Erend how to use holographic Focus interface.]

Erend: (to Varl) Like this? Whoa…!

Varl: You're not waving a hammer 'round, Erend - try a gentler touch.

Erend: My big sausage fingers don't really do gentle, okay?

Varl: Bring it back - trace the line to your right-- other right.

Erend: I just saw it. It's the one Aloy found up north… Gotcha.

[Erend has some energetic music coming on and dances to the beat.]

Erend: They call it a Concussion Beat Party or something! Now that's music!

Zo: Aloy.

Aloy: Erend. You're all better. And you're here.

Erend: Varl said you might need some help after all, doing complicated things…

Varl: We still have much training to do, of course. One does not become hunter in a day.

Zo: Each seed grows at a pace of its own. Doesn't mean it won't bloom. You should know your Tenakth friend arrived.

Aloy: Kotallo.

Erend: I heard their warriors drink people's blood. Might want to sleep with one eye open.

Varl: I think he's seen enough blood for a lifetime.

Zo: I showed him to one of the rooms. He seems to appreciate the privacy.

Aloy: Looks like you've got things under control. I should get this to GAIA--

Varl: Right. We'll keep on training, catch up as fast as we can.

Erend: Seeing glyphs in my dreams already!

Zo: Well, while you've been off gallivanting around, I've been working with GAIA to find out more about the land-gods. So from where I'm standing. you're in need of some training. Come along.

Varl: Uh… Oh, uh… O-kay-- Oh, and I delivered your message to Talanah. She headed for that Oseram camp you two were looking for to the southwest. The Old Ones created so many wonderful inventions to help others. To help the planet.

Varl: Technology really can be an amazing thing.

Erend: Until it gets a mind of its own and decides to kill everyone.

Varl: You're just a ray of sunshine, aren't you?

Erend: Only for you.

Aloy: Wow, this place is starting to come alive.

Varl: Yeah. And GAIA placed all the data she got from your focus into that… archive room. With the focuses you gave us, we'll be able to access it at our own pace. You know, learn and train. And if you need us, we'll be there to fight at your side.

Aloy: Got it. Thanks, Varl.

Aloy: How's, uh, "training" with Zo?

Varl: You know we really are training. Mostly. Look, she reads glyphs faster than I can already. I'd be a fool to refuse her help.

Aloy: Of course. Looks like I was wrong about the Zeniths. Their ship didn't explode on its way to Sirius like everyone thought.

Varl: We saw how they lied about creating a better future at their launch facility. Guess they lied about what happened to their ship too. But still A tribe settling amongst the stars.

Aloy: I couldn't put a single dent in their shields, Varl. That one Zenith almost killed me.

Varl: That didn't stop you from resurrecting GAIA. Won't stop us from using HEPHAESTUS against them.

Aloy: Let's hope that's enough. You guys reading something over there?

Varl: We just finished going through all the logs you collected back in Nora territory. And All-Mother Mountain. It's hard to imagine that my ancestors were trapped inside without the knowledge from APOLLO to guide them.

Aloy: Thanks to Ted Faro.

Varl: Yeah. I wonder how it must have felt when they were finally free. The world must have seemed so beautiful.

Aloy: Not to mention terrifying. They weren't much more than kids.

Varl: And they became an entire tribe.

Aloy: I'm guessing you've spoken with Kotallo?

Varl: I wanted to pay my respects for those who fell when we were ambushed at the Embassy. Told him I'd never seen anyone throw themself at a machine like he did. He said a warrior shouldn't be praised for fulfilling their duty. For a second I thought I was talking to my mother. Never thought a Tenakth and a Nora War-Chief could have so much in common.

Aloy: I'm guessing Talanah didn't stay for long?

Varl: You got that right. Makes you wonder what this Amadis guy did to grab her attention.

Aloy: Whatever it was, she didn't tell me.

Varl: Must be quite a story.

Aloy: I guess she'll tell us when she's ready. How's everyone handling their Focus?

Varl: We all have our difficult moments. Erend definitely curses the most. But I'm hoping Oseram’s stubbornness prevails.

Aloy: How's everyone doing?

Varl: Just… taking it all in. No one's snapped their bowstrings yet.

Aloy: Think you can hold the fort while I'm gone?

Varl: If Erend stops listening to the same music over and over again, maybe. We'll be fine.

[Aloy goes to Zo.]

Aloy: Varl looks happy about his training partner.

Zo: Learning is best done together.

Aloy: Have you gone back to Plainsong at all?

Zo: I thought about it. But… I wouldn't know what to tell them. The Chorus already thinks me a thorn in the thicket. If they knew what we did to Fa… Even if they understood, there'd be little they could grasp about all… …this. No. For now, I must leave the tribe behind.

Aloy: What are you up to?

Zo: GAIA was kind enough to put together a list of glyphs used by the Old Ones. She helped me decipher some of the data you’ve collected and showed me how to use the Focus to help the process. It's not easy, but it's been working so far.

Aloy: That's good to hear. I see you've settled in.

Zo: GAIA did say this place was built for us. So we could regain control of our lands with her… terraforming system. Nurture them like the land-gods do Plainsong's fields. It does strike me as odd that a place of life should have so much… metal.

Aloy: Sounds like you met my friend Talanah.

Zo: Yes. The Carja huntress. I haven't seen armor like hers since the Red Raids. But Varl tells me that she too, suffered at the hands of the Mad Sun-King.

Aloy: Yeah she's one of the good ones, trust me. You've spoken with Kotallo?

Zo: A few words. Tenakth don't have much use for us "outsiders." You must have made quite the impression for him to offer his fealty.

Aloy: So, you've been talking to GAIA?

Zo: Yes. She was kind enough to take me through some of the history of the Old Ones. Including their demise.. and the heroic actions of her creator, Elisabet Sobeck. I was… Surprised to see she was you. Passed, but reborn. Not that I claim to understand how.

Aloy: You've been getting to know Erend, I assume?

Zo: Of course. Any friend of Varl's is a friend of mine. In this case, a very loud friend.

Aloy: Did GAIA tell you anything about the Zeniths?

Zo: She did. Though it wasn't exactly easy to believe. To think that there are places among the stars where life can bloom as it does here… It is… humbling, to say the least. And heartbreaking that such life should be bent on destroying ours.

Aloy: So, how does a tribe like the Utaru manage to maintain the peace with warriors like the Tenakth? 

Zo: By holding them off. When our fields bloomed aplenty, the Tenakth looked upon our lands with envy. But Plainsong's dishes provided sanctuary and high ground to keep invaders at bay. In the end, even the Tenakth saw sense in a truce. The Utaru promised to provide the Tenakth with food from our crops every year. In exchange, the Tenakth would relinquish one of their own a Veteran, to train the Utaru in combat. This custom was abandoned a few years after the Derangement. But some Veterans still remain in the plains.

Aloy: Right. I should probably go.

Zo: I shall return to our training, then. Aloy, we've gathered some supplies in that chest. Take what you need. Did you forget something?

Aloy: I've been meaning to ask - what's the deal with you and the Chorus? You didn't seem to be on the best of terms.

Zo: That's what happens when you're the one Utaru who insists on publicly defying them. Twice. When the Carja invaded the Utaru plains, they did more than just attack our villages. They burned our fields, took our people as slaves and murdered those who were too weak to make the trip back to Meridian.

Aloy: To be sacrificed in the Sun-Ring.

Zo: I was helping the healers back then, as waves of refugees swarmed into Plainsong. The Chorus was divided in how to face the invaders. Some saw sense in raising arms. Others believed the dishes would keep us safe, as they had many times before. And while they bickered, I buried the seeds of the fallen.

Aloy: It couldn't have been easy, seeing your people suffer while the Carja invaded your lands.

Zo: I come from a small village near Plainsong. My grandmother used to say there was no seed that wouldn't grow there. I moved to the dishes when I decided to apprentice as a healer. When the Red Raids began, I thought about going back. But the injured kept pouring into Plainsong day after day, so I kept putting it off. One day, I woke up to hear a Carja raiding party had ransacked my village during the night. I rushed there with the healers to help the survivors but… there weren't any left. The smell of burning flesh haunts me to this day.

Aloy: I'm sorry, Zo.

Zo: I made it a point to appear before the Chorus as soon as we returned to demand that we take a stand against the invaders. I was denied Solleft to fight on my own.

Aloy: You said you set out to fight the Carja alone?

Zo:I did. But, it turned out I wasn't the only one. News of my… disagreement with the Chorus spread through the plains. Before I knew it, I had more than a dozen Utaru warriors ready to follow me into battle. We knew we couldn't take on the Carja armies head on, but we also knew the lay of the land better than they did. We ambushed smaller raiding parties, sabotaged their supply lines. and hit their encampments at night.

Aloy: Sounds like you were a force to be reckoned with.

Zo: Enough that the Tenakth took notice. When the clans began to push the Carja. back east they let us join their ranks. We chased the enemy all the way to Barren Light.

Aloy: You said you were at Barren Light when the Tenakth defeated the Carja?

Zo: Tenakth Marshals climbed the cliffs of the Daunt under cover of night, then attacked from the other side. Before we knew it, the gates were open, and the full force of the clans burst through. What happened next was.. not something I like to remember. When all the dust and blood settled, I smelled it again… the stench of burnt flesh. Our enemies defeated, what was left of my squad returned to the Utaru plains. I went back to Plainsong, but even as the harvests passed, it didn't feel like I'd truly returned at all.

Aloy: Is that when you became a Gravesinger?

Zo: I thought soothing the suffering of others would somehow appease my own. Then you came along. And gave me a choice. I could either sing at people's graves, or fight for a chance to keep them alive.

Aloy: I'm glad you chose the latter. I better get going.

Zo: Don't let me keep you.

[Aloy approaches Erend.]

Erend: Hey.

Aloy: Hey.

Erend: Nice place.

Aloy: Well, it's not like I built it or anything.

Erend: Right I can see why you, uh, why you had your doubts 'bout bringing us along. It is a lot to take in. But don't worry It's nothing I can't handle.

Aloy: Right. I was hoping you could help me with something. It's about the Tenakth rebels. And it also has to do with the Oseram.

Erend: Really? That doesn't sound good. Let me know what I can do to help.

Aloy: I see Varl gave you a Focus.

Erend: Doesn't look as fashionable on me, but by the forge, the things I've been able to see-- Granted a lot of them are bad you know, the Old World ending and such-- Still trying to wrap my head 'round most of it, but… I never really understood how you were ever able to find my sister back in the Sundom. And now do. Sort of. Makes me feel like I could be useful, you know?

Aloy: It takes some time. But, yeah. How are you settling in?

Erend: Varl's been helping me get the lay of the land, when he's not getting all tongue-tied.

Aloy: What about the Vanguard? Aren't you supposed to be back east ordering them around?

Erend: I sent some of them back to Meridian with a message. I doubt Avad'll mind me sticking around to help the Savior of Meridian.

Aloy: So, you've met our new Tenakth friend.

Erend: He's, uh, quiet. I thought his people were supposed to be bloodthirsty maniacs.

Aloy: You shouldn't believe everything you hear.

Erend: Yeah. Well, I guess if you trust him, so do I.

Aloy: So, Talanah came by the base?

Erend: More like rushed through. I was hoping she'd stay for a drink at least. Only Carja I've ever met who's any fun. But it seemed like she had more pressing matters to attend to.

Aloy: I guess you know what we're up against by now?

Erend: I'm not gonna lie when Vart first told me those bastards come from the stars. I thought he'd eaten too many of those medicinal berries. But I've gotten used to seeing impossible things. thanks to you. I just wish they weren't always trying to kill us.

Aloy: Yeah. You and me both. I discovered an Oseram militant group. They call themselves the Sons of Prometheus. It looks like they're the ones overriding machines for the Tenakth rebels.

Erend: I thought that was something only you could do.

Aloy: They're familiar with ancient tech. And they're as anti-Carja as it gets.

Erend: So… last year we stopped Dervahl and his cronies from blowing up Meridian in retribution for the Red Raids. And now you’re telling me we have another group of Oseram trying to wipe out the Carja with… …with an army of machines and bloodthirsty Tenakth?

Aloy: Pretty much.

Erend: Oh, well that's just great!

Aloy: Is there any way you can help me find out who they are? Anything to track them down and stop them?

Erend: Yeah. I can send out some messages from Chainscrape. Get in touch with my contacts in the Claim, see what I can find out.

Aloy: I'd appreciate that. Oh, and I'll let you know if I find out anything more about the Sons of Prometheus.

Erend: Same here.

[Aloy obverhears Zo and Varl exploring the base.]

Zo: Are you sure that's what the data says?

Varl: I'm telling you It's a drink. But it's soft.

Zo: How is it soft?

Varl: It says here it had… bubbles in it?

Zo: Well, we can't expect to make sense out of everything the Old Ones did.

Aloy: No good. Door's locked until GAIA can restore access.

[She goes to GAIA.]

GAIA: Welcome back, Aloy. When you're ready. please merge AETHER with me. Afterwards, I must discuss an important matter with you.

[She inserts a tube with AETHER into the console.]

Aloy: So, what did you want to discuss?

GAIA: While you were away, I received an unusual uranomission on my dedicated ELEUTHIA frequency.

Aloy: ELEUTHIA…that's one of the sub-functions you couldn't detect before…

GAIA: Yes. The transmission occurred so slowly that at first it seemed like an accidental blip of data amongst background static. Once I noticed this irregularity, it took some time to collate the complete message.

[GAIA shows Aloy some numbers with words SOS and BEWARE.]

Aloy: Coordinates. Where does it lead?

GAIA: To a mountain to the northwest of this facility. A word of caution, Aloy. It is possible this wansmission is genuine. It is also possible it is being broadcast by someone or something else.

Aloy: You don't think it's actually ELEUTHIA?

GAIA: I am uncertain.

Aloy: What's "SOS"?

GAIA: It is an old world code. A distress signal. A desperate plea for help.

Aloy: Why would ELEUTHIA send a coded transmission on a frequency only the two of you can communicate on?

GAIA: I believe it was done as a precaution to avoid detection. Or at least to create the appearance of the desire to do so. I am also uncertain why ELEUTHIA would expect that I would be able to detect and respond to its distress signal at all. As far as it is aware, I no longer function.

Aloy: Okay, so either ELEUTHIA is in trouble and sent the message hoping you were out there… Or someone else is trying to get us to go to these coordinates, pretending to be ELEUTHIA.

GAIA: That is my conclusion as well.

Aloy: Could the Zeniths be sending the transmission?

GAIA: According to the data I reviewed on your Focus, the Zeniths recovered the other GAIA root kernel in the HADES Proving Lab. It is feasible they used to gain access to my intemal frequencies.

Aloy: So, maybe they sent it thinking you'd respond and reveal your location.

GAIA: Possibly. However, the transmission is highly irregular. If they intended to provoke me into revealing myself, I would expect the communication to be more routine. 

Aloy: Right. So maybe it's not them, then. (opens her map) You said the coordinates lead to a mountain to the northwest What's there?

GAIA: I have no record of anything of note in that vicinity.

Aloy: Okay. And what about the other number in the message - 237. Any idea what that means?

GAIA: I have queried my available databases, but it does not appear to have any significance. Perhaps its meaning can only be understood at the indicated coordinates.

Aloy: All right. I'll go to the coordinates and check out the source of the transmission.

Erend: All by yourself? Ha! No way.

GAIA: I included Erend and Varl in this briefing via their Focuses. I concur that you should not investigate this alone.

Erend: What if it's a trap?

Aloy: Of course it could be a trap. But if it really is ELEUTHIA, then it's in trouble and I need to bring it back. Don't worry. I'll be careful and--

Varl: We're coming with you.

Aloy: Fine. Go grab your things.

Varl: We'll wait for you at the west exit in case you need to upgrade your gear.

["THE KULRUT" mission completed!]

CRADLE OF ECHOES
GAIA: (via Focus) Aloy, I was able to unlock another room in the main living area.

Aloy: Good to know. I’ll check it out when I can.

Erend: (from afar) That was another one of those "subordinate function" things?

Varl: (from afar) Yeah. That one was called HADES.

Erend: (from afar) Huh. And you said Aloy ended it for good, right? GAIA doesn't need it?

Varl: (from afar) I think we're all better off without it.

Erend: (from afar)  Uh-huh.

Aloy: Got to go after ELEUTHIA. Erend and Varl are waiting for me at the west exit.

Kotallo: Aloy.

Aloy: It's good to see you. I'm guessing you've got a lot of questions?

Kotallo: I've been told of our enemy and their intentions. Your friends showed me to the… Vision you keep in this place. GAIA. And gave me this focus. I don't pretend to fully understand everything. But all I really need to know is where to train and when to fight.

Aloy: Welcome to the team, then. What are you looking at over there?

Kotallo: The others have been helping me decipher the symbols the Focus shows me. So I thought I'd try to understand the weapon you intend to use against the enemy. This HEPHAESTUS. It will be able to "make" machines? That answer to GAIA.

Aloy: Yes.

Kotallo: How many?

Aloy: As many as we need.

Kotallo: Such power. Has the world ever seen the like?

Aloy: Now that you know who the enemy is, do you have any questions?

Kotallo: I'll admit I find them hard to grasp. From the heavens. And invulnerable.

Aloy: For now.

Kotallo: I will leave the strategy to you. I trust you will point my blade where it will cut the deepest.

Aloy: You've had some time with the team now. Any thoughts?

Kotallo: I admit I was surprised to see an Utaru here. Farmers don't make for effective soldiers.

Aloy: I'm told she rallied some in her tribe against the Carja. And fought all the way to Barren Light.

Kotallo: Interesting. Perhaps I am mistaken.

Aloy: You said the Bulwark was your home a long time ago. That you were part of the Sky Clan.

Kotallo: Yes.

Aloy: That's all you're going to tell me?

Kotallo: Fine. As you wish. My parents were killed in a clan skirmish. So I was raised by my squad. As I grew older, I came to be known as an accomplished fighter. Tekotteh took a special interest in me. I fought by his side against the Carja. And led my Squad on a dangerous climb into the Daunt. It was I who opened the gates at Barren Light from the east side, allowing the Tenakth to raze it.

Aloy: That must have gotten you some attention.

Kotallo: Indeed. I was welcomed home as a hero. And I was content.

Aloy: Then why'd you leave?

Kotallo: I became a Marshal.

Aloy: Why did you leave the Sky Clan to become a Marshal?

Kotallo: I was sent to the Kulrut by Tekotteh. Back then I would have obeyed his every order. I believed in him, like one would a father. I was too blind to see the fear in his eyes. Fear of a rising young warrior challenging his command of the clan. I returned a hero from the battle at Barren Light. But to him I was only a threat. Never occurred to him that I had no interest in rising above my station.

Aloy: Why did Tekotteh think you wouldn't be a threat to him if he sent you to the Kulrut?

Kotallo: Tekotteh knew that if I survived the Kulrut, I'd be forced to forsake the clan to serve the Tenakth as a whole. I'd never be allowed to challenge his command, even if I wanted to. After our victory at Barren Light. Tekotteh spoke to our people. Said it would be selfish to rob Hekarro and the Marshals of a warrior like myself. Even though he knew perfectly well! had no intention of ever leaving. It was exile guised as an honor. One he knew I couldn't refuse. So I became a Marshal and never looked back. 

Aloy: I'm sorry you had to go through that.

Kotallo: I am not. Though it pained me at the time, a Marshal is what I was destined to be.

Aloy: When we were at the Bulwark, the guards said something about the "Wings of the Ten." Hekarro also mentioned it at the Kulrut. Dekka, too. What does it mean?

Kotallo: The Visions tell us that the Ten flew on great metal machines with wings. And leapt into battle from the sky. For us, to imitate this feat is the ultimate expression of martial prowess. And it is why the challengers leap into the Arena during the Kulrut. Many times I imagined it as a child. The feeling of freedom. And the awe it must have inspired.

Aloy: What did Chief Hekarro say when you told him you'd be joining me here?

Kotallo: You spilt rebel blood at the Grove and helped reunite the clans. There was little more to be said. He understood.

Aloy: Well, I'm honored he lent me his best Marshal, at least for a little while, at least for a little while.

Kotallo: Indeed.

Aloy: I should go. Feel free to check in on Hekarro and your people. Door's always open here.

Kotallo: I will. I overheard that Varl and Erend are to accompany you on a mission. Do you require my assistance?

Aloy: I'd rather have you and Zo guard the base while we're away.

Kotallo: It shall be done. May the Ten walk with you.

[Aloy finds a room to think and relax for a while.]

Aloy: I've been carrying Elisabet's pendant with me for months. But since we're going to stay a while, I think I'll keep it here, where it'll be safe. Elisabet put all of her faith in GAIA. And GAIA put all of her faith in me. If I can do it all - recover the sub-functions, defeat Far Zenith, heal the world... I'd like to think Elisabet would be proud. Huh. Looks like someone's rearranged stuff in here.

GAIA: Aloy. I see you have found your room. Your companions thought you would appreciate a private space of your own.

Aloy: That was thoughtful of them. My old spear. Rost helped me make it when I finished my training. Feels like so long ago now. When Varl found me after the HADES Proving Lab... I thought I saw Rost. I don't think he'd understand any of this. Or what I have to do. But still. (sheds a tear) I wish he was here. This is the right of passage that Fashav gave me at the Embassy. I liked him. He seemed like a good man. I think he was really looking forward to going home. When I met Hekarro, I figured he was just another bloodthirsty warlord. But Fashav was right. Hekarro wants peace. It won't be easy. But with his new Marshals... maybe his vision has a chance.

[She finds Varl and Erend.]

Erend: There she is.

Varl: You ready to head out?

Aloy: Let's go.

Erend: Look at us! Three battle-hardened badasses forging into the unknown. This oughta be good! 

[They leave the base. In the next scene they climb a snowy mountain.]

Erend: This distress call had to be up a really steep mountain, huh?

[As they climb the mountain, Aloy notices some flashes and signals the others to keep their heads down. The "alien" girl shoots at the Tenakth warriors and kills them without much trouble.]

Verbena: Vermin!

Varl: What is that?

[The Tenakth manages to shoot her with a ballista, but the powerful shot does her no harm.]

Verbena: What the hell…?

[One of the warriors bravely attacks Verbena and... suddenly kills her. The warriors at the ballista accidentally detonate a projectile and blow themselves up.]

Erend: Well, that takes the keg.

Aloy: Varl, see if there's anything over there,

Varl: On it. 

Aloy: We'll check out the battlefield. Let's start with that Zenith. Well there are obviously more Zeniths than we know about.

Erend: Can't believe you fought one of them.

Aloy: Almost didn't make it. 

[She examines Verbena’s body.]

Aloy: Whatever the rebels did, it took down her shield. But why was she here? I can access ner last communication file, but I'll use my Focus to scan the battlefield, too.

Erend: What about that crazy weapon the Zenith had?

Aloy: It looked like she could make it come and go at will. But it's gone now.

Erend: Huh. Well go do your thing. I’ll wait here.

[Aloy plays the last record on Verbena’s Focus.]

Verbena: What?

Gerard: Hello Verbena. What do you have for me?

Verbena: I checked everywhere. Still no sign of the asset. Can we call off this pointless search already?

Gerard: Let's not forget who let it slip away in the first place. Now. I'd like to see results by nightfall. Do you think you can manage that?

Verbena: Hold on. I think I see something.

Aloy: This shows coming down heavy.

Erend: Forge's breath, what a mess.

Aloy: This Specter had instructions to “assist recovery of the asset.” I wonder what this “asset” is.

Erend: Brr. It's kinda chilly up here. You done looking around?

Aloy: Almost. 

[She examines the bodies of the Tenakth.]

Aloy: One of the Sons of Prometheus. It looks like his Focus was sending data on the weapon somewhere else. Ah. Weapon's still hot. I need to know how it worked, but I'll have to check on it once it's cooled off. Looks like the rebels camped here for a while. Were they watching this area? All right. I think I have an idea what happened here. I better get back to Erend.

Erend: All right she “who sees the unseen.” What did you find out?

Aloy: This was a carefully planned attack. I found camping gear up there. The rebels must have been staking out this place for at least a few days. They were waiting for the Zenith to show up. All so that they could test that weapon. The zeniths have a personal shield that makes them invulnerable. The Zeniths have a personal shield that makes them invulnerable. But somehow the weapon got rid of it. The Oseram that was operating it was sending data on it somewhere else. It was probably just a prototype.

Erend: I’ve known tinkers who'd do that. Do a little trial run before breaking out the real thing. I guess it's still a work in progress if it blew up.

Aloy: She was searching for something she lost. Her drone had instructions to recover something called “the asset.”

Erend: The asset? Is that the uh sub function thing you said could be here? ELEUTHIA?

Aloy: Not sure. Come on Let's go talk to Varl. 

[She and Erend go to Varl and find… a huge and very deep hole in the ground.]

Aloy: That's a long way down.

Varl: Something tunneled straight down into the mountain. Looks recent.

Aloy: Whatever it was. it must've been powerful. That Zenith the rebels killed was looking for something called “the asset.” I don't know what it is, but my guess is it's somewhere down there.

Varl: All right. So we head down.

Aloy: Erend, stay here and stand watch. That Zenith isn't the only one of its kind. I don't want to be caught by surprise if the others show up. Contact us by Focus if you see anything.

Erend: Okay. Any trouble shows up, I'll call you.

Aloy: Let's go.

[Aloy and Varl go down the hole.]

Aloy: There's some kind of Old World ruin down here.

Varl: You said the Zeniths have their own backup of GAIA. right?

Aloy: Yeah, from the Proving Lab.

Varl: So maybe they were after ELEUTHIA. Found its hiding spot. so it sent the distress signal.

[They find an ancient lab.]

Aloy: Maybe. Looks like some kind of data center. I might be able to access the facility's systems from that console. I've never seen a transmitter like this before. Looks like it self-destructed. This was a Far Zenith research lab. Looks like a lot of data was beamcast from here recently. From that device nearby.

Varl: So ELEUTHIA's gone?

Aloy: If it was ever here, then probably. But then why were the Zeniths still searching for “the asset”? Let's keep looking around.

Varl: So, exploring another Far Zenith ruin.

Aloy: At least this one doesn't seem to have giant killer machines.

Varl: Or anything you can blow up. All this... stuff. Wonder what they were doing here.

Aloy: Well, knowing Far Zenith, probably discovering amazing things. For their own benefit.

Varl: Yeah, that sounds about right. Find anything that might tell us what the asset is?

Aloy: I don't think so. Ectogenic chambers. Like the ones I saw inside a Zero Dawn Cradle facility.

Varl: What were they for?

Aloy: Remember when I told you I was made, not born? This is how.

Varl: A machine that makes a person. That's incredible.

Aloy: Yeah. This place keeps on going. We better check in that room. This place is huge. Some kind of storage room, maybe?

Varl: Maybe the asset is in here somewhere?

Aloy: If it is, somehow the Zenith couldn't find it. Let's look around. So, um, how is Erend taking all of this? Really.

Varl: Well... GAIA, the Zeniths, the Focus... it's a lot. But when I caught up to him in the Daunt and said you needed our help, he dropped everything and turned around.

Aloy: Well, he's loyal, that's for sure. A control console to access the storage units.

Varl: Can it tell us if the asset is in one of them?

Aloy: Well, let's find out.

Synthetic Voice: 236 containers in storage. Please enter the container number you'd like to retrieve.

Varl: 236. Wasn't there a number in the distress signal?

Aloy: You're right. I should check the log.

[She enters the number into the console. The huge storage machine lowers a container that looks like a capsule. Inside there is… a girl.]

Varl: Aloy… it's you. Skin's like ice. Must've cut this from her head. But why?

[He hands a device to Aloy. It contains a holographic recording.]

Beta: Hello, Elisabet - apologies, I don't know what else to call you. Um. My name is Beta. I'm afraid I must be brief. I only have a few minutes before my keepers discover I'm missing, and I still need to remove this implant. I had hoped to find shelter with you, but if you're viewing this, I may be dead. Be careful when you take on Far Zenith. They are ruthless, and they have ELEUTHIA, ARTEMIS, and APOLLO now. But at least they don't have the GAIA kernel to merge them with. 

[Varl searches the capsule and finds a yellow glowing tube containing source code.]

Beta: You must succeed or this was all for nothing. Good luck... and goodbye.

Aloy: So she's...?

Varl: She's still alive!

Aloy: We need to get her back to--

[They hear a loud noise from above.]

Erend: (via Focus) Whoa! Shit, they can fly? Aloy! Aloy, can you hear me through this thing?

Aloy: What's going on, Erend?

Erend: (via Focus) Two of those Specter-things just… fell out of the sky. One of them is heading down towards you. The other one's waiting up here.

Aloy: We're coming up. Stay in cover until I get there.

Erend: (via Focus) You got it.

Aloy: Get her to cover in that room Whatever happens, she stays with us.

[Varl picks Beta up in his arms.]

Varl: I'll protect her.

[He leaves with Beta.]

Aloy: I should prepare before the Specter gets here. I can't let it get through to Varl and the clone.

[She prepares to fight for their lives!!!!]

Aloy: Here it comes! 

[A Specter attacks her.]

Aloy: I should scan that thing… see if it has any weak spots. That thing's quick! Ooh, ugly one, aren't you? Ahh. There!

[She manages to defeat the machine!]

Varl: (via Focus) Are you okay, Aloy?

Aloy: Yeah, I'm heading up top. Stay down here with the clone for now.

Varl: (via Focus) Got it. I'll follow once the coast is clear.

Aloy: Gotta get back up top and deal with that other Specter. I just hope Erend stays in cover...

Erend: (via Focus) Aloy - ah!

Aloy: Erend?

Erend: (via Focus) The Specter's dug its heels in. It's got me pinned down.

Aloy: Hang tight. I'm almost there.

Erend: (via Focus) Just hurry.

[She hears sounds from an intense fight.]

Aloy: That doesn't sound good. I gotta get to Erend. 

[She leaves the tunnel and finds Erend hiding in the red grass.]

Aloy: Erend, I'm here.

Erend: Watch out. That thing's shooting down the center.

Aloy: Stay put. I'll see what I can do.

Erend: The second you need me, I'm there.

[The Specter stands in the open and fires towards Erend from time to time.]

Aloy: Specters not budging from that spot. I might be able to sneak up on it if I stay out of its line of fire. It's got some kind of shield up. I need to sneak around behind it. It'll be a tough fight if I take that thing head on.

[She sneaks towards the Specter.]

Aloy: A heavy weapon. I could use it against the Specter.

[She uses the heavy gun from a dead machine to disable Specter’s shield.]

Aloy: Well, well, well. Shields down. It's on the move!

[She continues to shoot it to the Stone Age. Even a piece of it falls off, probably a weapon. Then she defeats the Specter, Varl carries out Beta.]

Erend: Aloy, she… Look, I swear I'm not drunk but right now I'm seeing double!

Aloy: Long story. But it'll have to wait.

Varl: She needs a healer. We need to get her back to the base immediately.

Erend: Right. Yeah. Well, what are we waiting for then?

Aloy: You two go on ahead. I need to take another look at that weapon.

[Erend and Varl leaves with Beta.]

Aloy: If I can figure out how that thing works, maybe the Zeniths won’t be so invincible after all.

[She picks up the piece from the Specter but it crumbles in her hands.]

Aloy: No!

[She notices a disco ball looking sphere in the ashes.]

Aloy: Damn it. Well, it's better than nothing.

[She puts the sphere in her bag and returns to the base.]

Aloy: I need to get the weapon fragment to GAIA to analyze. If we can replicate it, maybe we'll have a way to defeat the Zeniths. I should check on the clone, too. Varl, where's our guest?

Varl: (via Focus) We're in the maintenance corridor below the Control Room.

Aloy: Okay… Holograms. GAIA, I thought you said the data here was lost?

[She approaches Erend who talks to himself.]

Erend: It's like my uncle, Lorund. Man didn't smile a day in his life and would box your ears if you messed with his forge.

Aloy: Erend. You okay?

Erend: Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, why wouldn't I be?

Aloy: 'Cause there's two of me... now?

Erend: There's two of you now! At least you seem to be handling it okay.

Aloy: I wouldn't say that exactly. But I'm trying. What you reading next?

Erend: I saw GAIA added something to the archives about metal rods being used to harness lightning during storms. It reminded me of a cousin of mine. Thought he could trap lightning if he covered himself in Stormbird plates. Went up the tallest mountain in the Claim to prove it. It ended like a lot of Oseram things do. With a spark and a boom.

Aloy: What are you working on with your Focus?

Erend: Still figuring out how to read stuff on this thing. To be honest, all the little symbols give me a headache. But I'll get up to speed, I promise.

Aloy: Did you speak with Beta at all?

Erend: She didn't really wake up till we brought her here. And when she did… I thought it'd be better if Zo and Var took care of her. No use crowding someone when they're in a state.

Aloy: I have to get going.

Erend: Don't go causing too much trouble.

[She goes to Zo.]

Zo: Aloy. You're back.

Aloy: Yeah. I'm just, uh, checking up on how everyone's doing.

Zo: You mean after meeting someone who looks exactly like you, but isn't you, down in the basement? Guess this must be even stranger for you than it is for us, huh?

Aloy: A little. (fake laugh)

Zo: Varl said she may be able to help us in our mission, though.

Aloy: Maybe. What else have you been up to?

Zo: I've been studying GAIA's seedlings, the sub-functions. I wanted to understand why one of them would do what they did to Fa. Imagine my surprise when I looked into this HEPHAESTUS... and found out it helped create all machines, our land-gods included. In a way, the Utaru owe HEPHAESTUS our whole way of life… as well as our current troubles.

Aloy: That's why we have to make GAIA whole again. Learn anything interesting lately?

Zo: There's been much to read up on now that AETHER has been reunited with GAIA. It's hard to imagine that machines like Stormbirds once helped heal the skies. I used to be terrified of them as a child. Thunder still brings chills to my skin. But everything GAIA creates has a purpose, no?

Aloy: Yeah. And if we can get HEPHAESTUS back she can get those Stormbirds in line. You said you met Beta?

Zo: Varl mentioned she was hurt. I thought I'd offer her an extract to soothe the pain.

Aloy: That was kind of you.

Zo: I just hope she doesn't plan on staying burrowed down there like that. She looks like she's barely seen the light of day as it is.

Aloy: I need to get going.

Zo: May the land bloom in your steps.

[Aloy goes to Varl.]

Varl: Aloy. Glad you made it back okay. She panicked after waking up and stumbled down here. I thought it best to wait for you.

Aloy: I'll talk to her.

[She walks to a room that looks like a server room.]

Aloy: Hello? It's, uh... it's Beta, right? My name's Aloy. What's wrong? Is it your injury? 

Beta: “Simulacrum Withdrawal Syndrome.”

Aloy: I don't understand.

Beta: Sudden removal of a neurologically-integrated data device. The brain, especially the cerebellum, goes into a kind of sensory free-fall. Everything real feels... unreal. Distant.

Aloy: Is there anything that can help?

Beta: Do you have a Focus to spare? It's primitive... but I can make it work.

Aloy: Yeah.

[She hands her a Focus.]

Beta: Booting up. Ahhh. So... Aloy. I suppose you want information.

Aloy: About you and the Zeniths, yeah. Why are they here? What do they want? How did they get you? But let's start at the beginning. I’m guessing they faked the destruction of their ship a thousand years ago?

Beta: That seems consistent with their behavior. They wouldn't want to be followed.

Aloy: So Far Zenith established a colony world after all.

Beta: Yes for a few hundred years. But it didn't last. Some sort of natural disaster rendered it uninhabitable.

Aloy: Okay. So, the descendants of Far Zenith escaped a dying planet… and now they want to claim Earth for themselves?

Beta: Not their descendants.

Aloy: What?

Beta: Not their descendants. It's them. The same ones who left Earth a thousand years ago. You didn't know?

Aloy: How can they still be alive? They don't even look... what did they do to themselves?

Beta: I believe it’s a combination of pharmaceuticals, cellular treatments, and technological implants.

Aloy: And you Does that mean that you're--

Beta: I'm not like them. I was made on the way to Earth. On the ship. I spent years studying in my training interface. All so that I could serve my function.

Aloy: Access and control of the terraforming system. But why? What do the Zeniths want with it?

Beta: When I discovered the Zero Dawn system had disseminated into its sub-components, I thought my purpose was to fix it. But I don't think the Zeniths want that at all. I think they want to wipe Earth clean and start over.

Aloy: So the Zeniths want to exterminate life on Earth. That's what GAIA and I concluded too. But why? Why kill everyone just to take over?

Beta: When they took me on missions with them, I saw how they butchered the tribal people we encountered. They didn't seem to care about a rejuvenated Earth. So, I concluded that they must want a hard reboot of the system. Then they can redesign it to be exactly what they want.

Aloy: Mass extinction for their own comfort? Who thinks like that? Well, without their GAIA kernel they'll have a hard time doing that. The Zeniths needed Elisabet's gene print to access Zero Dawn facilities, so they made you. Trained you. And you went along with it?

Beta: They told me I was born to interface with the Zero Dawn system. When we reached Earth, I pieced together what must have happened to GAIA and her subordinate functions. That's when I started to realize I wasn't meant to fix GAIA. That they must've made me so I could do what their remote Extinction Signal failed to do - reboot Earth for their own benefit.

Aloy: So, you know about the Extinction Signal?

Beta: It was speculation but the only logical conclusion why GAIA suddenly self-destructed after operating efficiently for centuries. GAIA would have only undertaken such a desperate course of action if it had detected a threat to life on Earth… that was more dangerous than ceasing function altogether. I should have realized that she would also order the recreation of Elisabet Sobeck to rebuild her.

Aloy: Yeah, well... surprise. So we're dealing with the same Far Zenith people who once lived on Earth. What else do you know about them?

Beta: They were some of the most affluent and powerful people on Earth. They controlled almost every major resource, every industry. Gerard commands them. He's the one who decided to set up a base. The others - Erik, Tilda, Verbena - they resent his authority over them, but in the end, they always do what he says.

Aloy: Erik. He's the one I fought back in the HADES Proving Lab.

Beta: He enjoys hurting people.

Aloy: Yeah. I know. You mentioned the Zeniths set up a base here on Earth. Where is it?

Beta: Off the coast, I think. Whenever I had to go on missions, I was transported inside of a Specter drone. I couldn't see anything outside. But I did overhear the Zeniths talking about it once. They were discussing setting up a perimeter energy shield to… "repel the local fauna." I'm certain they have other security measures - Specter patrols, machine lures. It must be impregnable.

Aloy: What's inside the base?

Beta: Launch facilities so they can shuttle back and forth to their ship. in orbit. Plus infrastructure to gather materials and fabricate anything they need.

Aloy: Are there more Zeniths than the ones you met?

Beta: I'm not sure. I suppose there must be more of them in the base or back on the ship. For all know, there could also be more of them out in space. Other survivors of the colony.

Aloy: You said the Zenith's colony in the Sirius system was destroyed. What happened?

Beta: All I was ever told was that a natural disaster forced them to leave Sirius. I've speculated that it was an extrasolar object, or a cataclysmic seismic event… ...or maybe even an abnormally violent coronal mass ejection from Sirius A.

Aloy: The Zeniths never told you any details?

Beta: They said the only thing that mattered was that they survived. First Earth, a thousand years ago, and then Sirius.

Aloy: Guess they survived old age, too. How did you escape the Zeniths?

Beta: Before the HADES Proving Lab, I never thought I'd get away from them. Even if I were to run, I'd never survive on my own in the wilds. But then I saw you. And I thought that maybe you could help me. But then I saw you. And though. So when the Zeniths pinpointed ELEUTHIA's location in the biomedical research facility, I saw an opportunity.

Aloy: You said you saw an opportunity to escape when you went to capture ELEUTHIA. What did you do, exactly?

Beta: Whenever I was taken out on a mission to recover a subordinate function, only one of the Zeniths would go with me.

Aloy: The one the rebels killed outside the facility.

Beta: Verbena's dead? How did they bypass her shield?

Aloy: I'm looking into it. But you were talking about your escape?

Beta: Well, when it was time to use the Zeniths' transmitter to send ELEUTHIA back to base. I also sent the encrypted transmission. Then I distracted Verbena long enough to seal myself in the ectogenic chamber… ...altering the facility's logs so it appeared that there were only 236 containers. 

Aloy: And the GAIA root kernel?

Beta: I told them I could capture ELEUTHIA faster if I had it with me, and they believed me.

Aloy: Well done. You said you were born on the way to Earth. In an artificial womb. I'm guessing?

Beta: The Zeniths had an ectogenic chamber aboard the ship, an updated version of the one you found me in. They must have used a stored sample of Elisabet's DNA.

Aloy: I doubt Elisabet would've let them take her DNA. Do you know how they got it?

Beta: That wasn't part of the archive I was allowed to access.

Aloy: You said you spent years studying in a training interface. Was this archive you mentioned part of that?

Beta: But only the parts I was permitted to access. Aristotle and Aspasia the avatars of the archive - would assign me learning modules and evaluate my progress.

Aloy: Wait, those names... they were designed to be the virtual guides for the APOLLO database. Before Ted Faro purged it.

Beta: The Zeniths have a copy.

Aloy: So it still exists... and you got to learn from it.

Beta: Only what was deemed pertinent to the mission. If I requested information outside of my parameters, my tutors would deny it.

Aloy: To have all that knowledge... just out of reach. Must have been frustrating. All right, I think that's enough for now. Do you want to come upstairs, or--

Beta: So how long? You know… your plan. How long before GAIA's fabricated a machine army to defeat the Zeniths?

Aloy: How did you know..?

Beta: Optimal strategy. So?

Aloy: Well, I still have to get two more subordinate functions before GAIA's powerful enough to absorb HEPHAESTUS.

Beta: What? You don't have HEPHAESTUS already?

Aloy: GAIA's still figuring out how to capture it. It's not confined to a single--

Beta: (frustrated)  To a single location, of course not! You didn't even know who the Zeniths really are. You were supposed to be further along by now! Coming here was a mistake. They're going to find me. They're going to find this place and take me back. This was all for nothing!

Aloy: They're not going to find us. GAIA's using MINERVA to mask our location.

Beta: (in panic attack) What difference does it make? You're too far behind. We're never going to beat them! Everything...everyone... are going to die.

Aloy: Hey. Calm down. You're here now, right? You're here now, right? So is there anything you can do to help?

Beta: I have certain knowledge sets. And given your state of progress… expertise you probably lack. Geo-engineering, of course. Computer science, Physics, biology, chemistry.

Aloy: Okay, well, see if you can do something with that. Talk to GAIA. I'll check on you later.

[She leaves the room.]

Varl: How'd it go?

Aloy: Her injury's not that bad, but I think she regrets coming here. Feeling might be mutual.

Varl: Hmm. I'll come back later and talk to her. See if I can learn anything.

Aloy: (to herself) I should get the weapon fragment to GAIA.

Erend: (from afar) Ow! This Focus thing's trying to kill me.

Varl: (from afar) You did almost drown it in beer.

Erend: (from afar) Not on purpose!

Aloy: Hey. You and Erend okay?

Varl: Nothing some rest can't take care of. Are you okay? This Beta thing it's a lot. Even for you.

Aloy: Just trying to take it one step at a time.

Varl: Fair enough. If you need anything just let me know.

Aloy: It's good to see you and Zo enjoying yourselves.

Varl: We're learning a lot. I've actually been looking through the data to find ideas for a gift. To thank her for helping me study the glyphs. Something from the Old World that she's never seen before. Instead I found out they gave each other stuffed... animals? If you ask me, stuffing a dead animal with - anything, really - doesn't sound like a good time for anybody.

Aloy: Maybe GAIA can help you find something else. How's everyone dealing with Beta?

Varl: I tried explaining what a clone is to Erend. He was totally lost. Then Zo said something about two trees coming from one seed. That seemed to help a bit.

Aloy: I see everyone's settling in.

Varl: Zo's planning on bringing all kinds of plants in here. Says a home should always "spring with life anew." I asked Erend to help find some. I think he'd rather stick his head into a Snapmaw.

Aloy: Still, it's not a bad idea. Should liven up the place. I should get back to the wilds.

Varl: I'll keep an eye on Beta. Make sure she's comfortable.

Aloy: Okay.

[She goes to GAIA.]

GAIA: Welcome back. Aloy, I see we have a new guest. So now we know the origin of the transmission.

Aloy: Yeah. I also recovered this. (pulls out the sphere) The weapon it was part of somehow stripped a Zenith of its shield. But it malfunctioned and blew up. If we can recreate the weapon and improve it, maybe we'll gain the upper hand on the Zeniths.

GAIA: A moment. I will scan it. Complete. By combining the results with data from your Focus, I can infer that the weapon was highly advanced… …comparable to Zenith technology. But not how it worked.

Aloy: Did the explosion corrupt the data?

GAIA: It was only a catalyst. The moment the weapon malfunctioned it appears a command executed to purge all data within its core. Ostensibly, this was to prevent the weapon's secrets from falling into enemy hands. Whoever designed this weapon knew how to cover the tracks.

Aloy: Sylens?

GAIA: Based on your data on him, that is my conclusion as well.

Aloy: And he's not going to cooperate with us. Well, it was worth a shot. But… that's not all. The Zeniths got ELEUTHIA. Along with ARTEMIS and APOLLO.

GAIA: That is unfortunate. However, our original plan remains unchanged. The two remaining subordinate functions should increase my heuristic processing density enough to absorb HEPHAESTUS.

Aloy: Right One problem at a time. Well, I guess I better get back out there.

GAIA: I wish you luck on your search.

Aloy: Right. Thanks, GAIA. (to herself) So I guess we won’t be making use of Sylens’ weapon… And now there is another clone of Elisabet here with us. But I can't let it distract me. I still have two more sub-functions to get.

[She leaves GAIA’s room. “CRADLE OF ECHOES” mission completed!]

Erend: (listening to music) Pam! Whomp! Pah! Dah!

Zo: It's a little loud, Erend.

Erend: I know! Makes you want to punch something!

Varl: More like someone.

Erend: You're the one that helped me find it!

Varl: People make mistakes.

The Second Verse (start)
Zo: There is something I'd like to discuss. It's about the land-gods. If you have time, that is.

Aloy: You said you wanted to talk about the land-gods?

Zo: I think there's a way to heal them so that they'll once again provide Plainsong with grain. GAIA gave me a set of instructions. She called it a "reboot code." If we deliver it to the land gods their Derangement will end.

Aloy: That's great!

Zo: Maybe. There are thorns on the path. Unless the code is given by HEPHAESTUS, the land-gods will reject it. GAIA showed me a way around this. We need components called “control cores” from machines made by HEPHAESTUS. Machines similar to the land-gods...

Aloy: You mean Grimhorns. Like the one we fought in the Repair Bay.

Zo: Yes. GAIA helped me locate two of them out west.

Aloy: So. Kill the machines. Get the control cores. Then use them to adapt the reboot code into something the land-gods will obey?

Zo: If all goes well. But taking down two Grimhorns won't be easy.

Aloy: We'll do it together.

Zo: Bless you, Aloy. I'll send you the location of the machines.

Aloy: I'll let you know when I get close to those Grimhorns.

Zo: Good. If we can get their control cores, maybe we really can heal the land-gods.

[New Side Quest begins - “The Second Verse.” Aloy finds Varl and Zo’s room.]

Aloy: Looks like someone's made this space their own.

GAIA: (via Focus) I see you have found Varl and Zo's room, Aloy. I believe they wanted private accommodations.

Aloy: I see.

Erend: So the Old Ones painted their faces with something called "makeup." Like the Carja. Why? Yeah, beats me.

Zo: It probably meant something to them. As it does to my people, and the Tenakth.

Erend: I just think my face says it all as is, that's all.

Zo: That it does.

[Aloy levas the base and travels to the Grimhorn site.]

Aloy: This is where Zo said we’d find the Grimforns she needs parts from to heal Plainsong’s land-gods. I should let her know I'm here. (via Focus) Hey, Zo. I'm near the Grimhorn site. Can you join me?

Zo: (via Focus) I'll be there soon.

[Some time passes.]

Zo: Aloy. I'm glad we can do this together. The Grimhorns we're looking for should be just to the north.

Aloy: Let's go get those control cores.

[She follows Zo.]

Zo: Thank you again for helping me. If this works. if we can heal the land-gods - it will end a generation of suffering for my people.

Aloy: How do you think Fane and the Chorus will take it? They seem to think the tribes extinction is inevitable.

Zo: I’ve had my disagreement with them. I’d like to see they'll be happy to be wrong on this.

Aloy: There. The Grimhorns.

Zo: And they're not alone.

Aloy: We'll just have to be smart about this.

Zo: I'll follow your lead.

[Aloy sets some traps and attack The Grimhorn from a safe position.]

Aloy: Could give it a taste of its own weapon!

[After an intense fight our girls win.]

Aloy: That's it. We did it. You okay?

Zo: A bit winded, but I'll be all right.

Aloy: I'll grab the cores.

Zo: Be my guest. I'll take those cores, Aloy.

Aloy: Two control cores, as requested.

Zo: Thank you. GAIA showed me a way to scan them and take what we need to update the reboot code. I'll head back to base and get started. When I was a child, there was always enough to eat. The land-gods provided for us, and every season we celebrated them. My happiest memories come from those times. Do you really think we can bring them back?

Aloy: We'll make it happen.

Zo: Thank you, Aloy.

[She leaves.]

Aloy: (to herself) Zo will probably need some time to sort through those cores, I should do something else in the meantime.

[She returns to the base.]

Erend: Pizza?

Varl: Apparently it tastes worse the longer it takes to be delivered... or something like that.

Zo: Maybe you can find the recipe.

Varl: I think it was just flat bread. With cheese. And some sauce.

Erend: I like it already.

[Aloy approaches Zo.]

Aloy: I was hoping we could talk.

Zo: Go ahead.

Aloy: Now that you have those control cores, are you ready to reboot the land-gods in Plainsong?

Zo: Not yet. GAIA told me the reboot code has to be altered using data from the cores. She updated my Focus with “software” to accomplish this task, but apparently it's very complicated. It'll take time.

Aloy: Well, let me know if you need any help.

Zo: I will.

Aloy: I should get going.

Zo: May you unearth that which you seek.

Errand: The Taste of Victory (start)
[Aloy leaves the base and explores a little. She finds Rukka, a talkative Tenakth she met before.]

Rukka: I see you, Champion. Sit please. Choosing the right rations can be just as important to your chance of survival as choosing the right weapons. If you want food that'll save your life out in the wilds, go northwest to Salt Bite. The cook there, Pentalla, she'll whip up a meal for anyone who needs it. Tenakth or not.

Aloy: I’ll make sure to pay her a visit if I'm out that way.

[New Errand begins - “The Taste of Victory”. Next she visits Camp Nowhere where she finds Talanah with some Oseram named Ragurt.]

Need To Know (start)
Aloy: Something nearby is sending that signal.

Ragurt: So then I scrambled myself up a tree. Not an easy feat with these clobber feet. Report on the rest with these clobber feet.

Talanah: Are your stories always so...

Ragurt: Engaging?

Talanah: Yeah. That.

Porguf: Think I might make this a camp proper. Little rest stop on the journey to the delve site.

[Aloy approaches Talanah.]

Aloy: Talanah. Glad to see you made it.

Talanah: Thanks to the secret passage through your base. It was quite a sight.

Ragurt: Secret passage? Don't let the others hear you say that or you'll have a lot of Oseram knocking at your door.

Aloy: And you are?

Talanah: This is Ragurt. He's a scout with this caravan. He says Amadis was here.

Ragurt: He joined up with our expedition right before we went through the tunnel. After we made camp here. I set out to do some scoutin’. I also made peace offerings to the Tenakth for trespassing in their territory. Amadis wanted me to ask around about some place called The Rot.

Aloy: What did you find out?

Ragurt: Most I learned was that it's where the Tenakth took their prisoners… Somewhere far to the west, near Thornmarsh the Lowland Clan's capital. He set out to find it not long after.

Talanah: On his own?

Ragurt: I tried to warn him, but he was dead set on going.

Aloy: Did Amadis say anything about why he was heading to The Rot?

Ragurt: Afraid not. He was a man of few words.

Talanah: Sounds like him. Did he look okay to you?

Ragurt: More or less. He seemed shaken when we learned the tunnel had collapsed behind us. But then again, so was everyone around here.

Aloy: So you're a scout for this crew? Anything I should know about the area?

Ragurt: Where to start? Down south we got a trio of Oseram trying to delve into the ruins in the sand.

Aloy: There are more of you?

Ragurt: They're the ones we followed out here in the first place. And then there are all the other folk who broke away as soon as we got to this side of the tunnel. Salvagers, explorers, all sorts of daring venturers.

Talanah: Just how many of you were there?

Ragurt: Enough to lose track, that's for sure. also spotted some rebels a while back, too. Seems like they've been patrolling the desert. Heard all about the rebellion from the Tenakth up in Scalding Spear. That's the Desert Clan's capital, north of here.

Aloy: Sounds like you’ve really gotten to know the area. 

Ragurt: It's what I do.

Aloy: Thanks, Ragurt. This has been helpful.

Ragurt: Hope you find him. (leaves)

Talanah: Okay, I'll head for Thornmarsh. Meet me there--

Aloy: Hold on.

Talanah: What?

Aloy: You're willing to go to the ends of Terakth territory to find this guy, no hesitation.

Talanah: Of course. He's one man alone in the Forbidden West. I'm just worried about him.

Aloy: I think it's more than that. I'll meet you near the Lowland capital. But then you're going to tell me who Amadis really is.

Talanah: Fine. I'll lay low, north of the village. See you there.

Errand: Supply Drop
[On the way to the Thornmarsh Aloy meets a guy fighting a bulky and angry machine.]

Vetteh: Damn machine. Get out of my way!

Aloy: That Tenakth soldier's in trouble.

[She helps the guy.]

Vetteh: Now the tide's turned! It's done! Phew. I need a word. Quickly! You've got to help my friend!

Aloy: Wait. Slow down and explain.

Vetten: Littay and I were heading south with supplies from Salt Bite when machines attacked. I left her behind so I could get help from the Grove. And ran straight into another machine! Thank the Ten you were here to help.

Aloy: So your friend is still up the road, fighting machines?

Vetteh: That's what I'm trying to tell you!

Aloy: I'll bail her out if I can You go on and get those reinforcements.

Vetten: Will do! I'm in your debt! (runs away)

Aloy: One more day behind me. The other Tenakth should be somewhere up the road. A supply sled, minus the supplies. And the Tenakth soldier. It looks like the Tenakth tried to salvage some supplies after getting attacked. Then dropped them in a running battle? Maybe they can lead me to the other soldier. There. Tracks from the missing Tenakth. Definitely looks like the other Tenakth ran off this way. Shock's not going to help me here. 

[By evening, she finds another Tenakth who is also fighting machines.]

Aloy: That must be the other Tenakth. Hey! Vetteh sent me!

Littay: By the Ten, that lump made it. I thought we were both finished!

Aloy: Let's clear out these machines!

Littay: More machines inbound!

Aloy: I gotta get more ammo!

Littay: We've got incoming! Blazes - how are we going to take that thing down?

Vetteh: Attack! No time to lose!

Littay: Vetteh! You stubborn fool, you haven't let me down yet!

Aloy: Last shot of that!

Vetteh: Almost done!

Littay: You did it. I can't believe I'm alive. Come on over. Please.

Vetteh: A word before you move on?

[Aloy approaches the Tenakth.]

Littay: Thanks. If you hadn't shown up. I would've been machine grist.

Aloy: All I did was give your friend here a little time to come to the rescue.

Vetten: Ha. You're full of it. I barely escaped with my life on the road.

Littay: That I believe.

Aloy: I hope some of your supplies are still useable.

Littay: Me too. Food's always scarce. The soldiers at the Grove need the rations. No way we can trek back north to Salt Bite to get more.

Vetteh: I'll get this one back on her feet and we'll scrape what's left of our haul off the dirt.

Littay: Mmm. You're making me hungry. Thanks, outlander. We won't forget what you did.

Aloy: Stay safe, both of you.

[Errand completed! Aloy continues exploring the surroundings.]

Aloy: A lot of debris. What happened here? Better take a closer look. And down! Maybe I should look around more before I move on. Got a moment before it thaws! Skin's cracking from the cold. More debris. But it looks like the trail keeps going up. Maybe I should look around more before I move on. Okay. Better take a look at that debris. A Tenakth mask. Something tore through this place. Looks like there's a trail of debris. I can follow up the mountain. Trail ends here. Hello? Anyone here? Nothing. No sign of a machine attack either… maybe one of those big storms swept through. If there was anyone here, they're long gone now. 

[She finds an elephant looking machine, Tremortusk, on a frozen river and decides to take it on.]

Aloy: Machine's resistant to fire. Ah, machine's onto me. Machine's got frostbite!

[After winning over the monster aloy glides into some narrow canyon full of Tenakth warriors.]

Aloy: Gliding in!

[The canyon leads her to a small village in the mountain.]

Tenakth Soldier: Any soldier of worth has sharpened their skills at the Hunting Grounds.

Tenakth Soldier: It is said Regalla is moving in for the kill. We shall see.

[Aloy decides to find the Tallneck of the region first before taking any actions.]

Aloy: Something nearby is sending that signal.

[She overrides a Charger.]

Aloy: Hold still.

[She rides towards the signal.]

Aloy: Sounds like a Tallneck's nearby. Oh, Stalkers. My favorite invisible killing machines. Gotcha! A Lowland settlement. Looks abandoned. But high enough to get me on that Tallneck, if I can find a way to the top. 

[She explores the abandoned village.]

Aloy: I need to get to that platform. Just gotta find a way. There we go. This might be high enough to jump on that Tallneck.

[She manages to jump on the Tallneck.]

Aloy: Huh. Looks like this Tallneck's missing some parts. There's no way to climb to the top. I'll have to find a platform that's high enough to reach its head directly. 

[She uses nearby buildings to climb higher on the Tallneck.]

Aloy: There's gotta be a way to reach higher ground somewhere. Thanks for the ride, buddy. Now to find higher ground. Better watch my step. Looks like I'm not alone. Those jaws look like they could crush metal and bone alike. Time to leave the party! All right. I should be able to find a spot to jump onto that Tallneck from here. No need to act suspicious… Trees as tall as towers. The Stand of the Sentinels. That's better! It's all right. I'm almost done. 

[She overrides the Tallneck!]

Aloy: Good. Got the data.

[She jumps on her Charger and continues her quest.]

Aloy: Fenirra said her father's hunting camp should be near here. I can catch my breath here.

[She finds herself a mighty machine to fight with.]

Aloy: It's a lot of fluid sloshing around in that Bellowback's sac.

[After defeating the Bellowback she rides past some ruins.]

Aloy: An Old World ruin. I wonder what's inside?

[Finally she finds Talanah in the marches.]

Need To Know (continue)
Aloy: Easy there.

Talanah: Thornmarsh. Quite a sight, isn't it? Never thought I'd find myself this deep in Tenakth territory.

Aloy: Have you run into any trouble?

Talanah: I've been keeping my head down. Had to duck into the swamps a couple of times to avoid Tenakth patrols.

Aloy: Well, I'm here now. So spill it. Who is Amadis, really?

Talanah: Like I said before, he helped me put a stop to a hunter-killer machine out in the wilds. At first, he thought I was just another hunter from the Lodge who only cared about the biggest machine trophy. And I thought he was just a grouchy hermit living in the woods. But then... he trusted me with the truth. Told me how the Red Raids took everything from him. Seeing that side of him… I don't know. Changed things.

Aloy: You love him, don't you?

Talanah: I think I might, yeah.

Aloy: Then why did you part ways?

Talanah: When he told me how he failed to save the woman from his past. I told him how I made peace with my father and brother's deaths. He realized he needed to do the same, on his own.

Aloy: Wait. When we searched that Red Raids battlefield together, you said he'd lost someone close to him there. I thought you meant a fellow soldier.

Talanah: She was. Women aren't allowed to serve in the Carja army, but Nessa disguised herself so she could. Amadis kept her secret. When he left to come out west, he promised he'd send word that he was all right. But his letter never came.

Aloy: So you set out to find him.

Talanah: And when we do, I'll have words for him for leading us on this wild goose chase.

Aloy: Well at least I kind of understand now. Amadis thought Nessa died on the battlefield. But when he learned that the Tenakth took prisoners back west, he kept going. So I guess now we find this prison. The Rot.

Talanah: I did some scouting while I was waiting. I think I might've found the way.

Aloy: Lead on, then.

[She follows Talanah.]

Aloy: Do you think Nessa might still be alive?

Talanah: I doubt it. Any Carja prisoners from the Red Raids would've been killed or returned home by now.

Aloy: Then what's Amadis after?

Talanah: I think he just needs to know.

[They hear a man’s voice nearby.]

Amadis: Ha! Over here you filatning hunk of scrap!

Talanah: That's him!

Aloy: That Fireclaw's right on his heels.

Talanah: He’s no match for it alone. Come on!

Amadis: Got you! Talanah?

Talanah: We've got your back! Not now!

Aloy: Uh-oh. I've been spotted.

Amadis: Hit it with freeze ammo! Hit it with ice! Lure it into the traps! Freeze it!

[After a quite difficult fight they manage to defeat the monster.]

Amadis: Talanah, I—

Talanah: You were supposed to let me know you were okay.

Amadis: I was going to send the message right after I crossed into the desert with an Oseram caravan. But when it became clear that the tunnel had  collapsed behind us. I figured the only thing I could do was press on. Seeing as you found a way out here, however... clearly I was wrong. I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted was to worry you.

Aloy: So… you must be Amadis.

Amadis: And you must be Aloy. Talanah's told me a lot about you. And I guess you must know about me.

Aloy: A little. We know you're headed for The Rot. But what are you hoping to find there?

Amadis: A clue... or a shred of one. Anything about Nessa's fate. Maybe she died on the battlefield. Or maybe she wasted away in that prison. Either way. I have to know.

Aloy: Talanah told me about you and Nessa during the Red Raids. That you kept her secret.

Amadis: We were both assigned to the Southern Spear division. Our orders were to push into Tenakth territory through the tunnel. She was proud to serve the Sundom, at first. But as the atrocities mounted we both saw the Raids for what they were.

Aloy: And... the two of you grew close?

Amadis: We did what we could to protect innocent lives. It felt like we were the only ones who objected to the slaughter. And... yes, we were close. Until the Battle of the Burning Blooms.

Aloy: What happened at the Battle of the Burning Blooms?

Amadis: I had intel that the Tenakth forces were greater than we had anticipated. I tried to convince my commander to halt the attack. He was a drunken lout. And when I threatened to reveal his incompetence to Carja High Command, he pulled a knife on me. So I killed him.

Talanah: In self-defense.

Amadis: It was still murder. I was condemned. But I thought at least I could still save Nessa. I was too late. By the time I got to the battle, the fields were already burning, our soldiers slaughtered or missing. What's more, the commander I had killed was from a powerful noble house. They put a bounty on my head. I've been on the run ever since.

Aloy: The Red Raids are long over. Sun-king Avad would pardon you if he knew--

Amadis: The Sun-King can't help me.

Talanah: A pardon from Avad won't stop bounty hunters eager to claim their prize.

Aloy: So, you and Talanah. Sounds like the two of you had an adventure out in the wilds. 

Amadis: Clawstriders, a hunter-killer mercenaries a Shellsnapper... nothing could get in her way.

Talanah: A scruffy hermit in the woods certainly tried.

Amadis: That was foolish of him, in hindsight.

Aloy: Well, we're here now. So let's head to The Rot.

Amadis: I can't ask you to come with me. I feel bad enough you've come this far.

Talanah: I didn't come all this way just to leave you now. We'll see this through together.

Amadis: I know better than to try to talk you out of it. Come, then. The Rot's not far.

[Aloy and Talanah follow Amadis.]

Amadis: The Rot’s along the shore, but we'll have to stick to the woods to avoid being seen.

Aloy: How did you find it?

Amadis: I overheard a Tenakth patrol from the nearby village talking about it. Figured it out from there.

Aloy: Hope this tastes as good as it looks.

Talanah: What were you going to do if we hadn't found you? Take it on alone?

Amadis: only need to question one guard. Figured I'd grab someone when they were by themselves.

Aloy: Well, now you have us.

Amadis: We're getting close. Just a little further. 

[They hide in the bushes.]

Amadis: There it is. The Rot.

Aloy: Those are Regalla's rebels. They're waging civil war against the rest of the Tenakth. They must've taken over the prison.

Amadis: Then they would've killed any of the guards. They were my last hope of finding out if Nessa was there.

Aloy: Maybe not. There might still be some clue inside.

Amadis: Even after all this time?

Talanah: Aloy can see much more than you are.

Amadis: Then let's do it. Any scrap of hope is better than nothing.

Aloy: We'll have to find another way in. The front gate looks impenetrable.

Talanah: And there's no way we're scaling those walls.

Aloy: You two stay here. I'll see if I can find another way in and get that gate open.

[As always Aloy decides to work alone with only her head on the line.]

Aloy: I should check around the sides. Might be a way in from the water. 

[She has to take a little swim in the cold sea...]

Aloy: Well that'll keep me awake. I gotta get to the main gate to let Talanah and Amadis in. One down. If I can get the main gate open, Talanah and Amadis can help me clear out the rest of this place. Come on, come on… The gate's open! Let's go!

Talanah: We've got your back, Aloy!

Tenakth Soldier: Let us out!

Aloy: Hold on! As soon as the coast is clear!

Amadis: We’ll stay here.

Aloy: That's all of them.

[The rebel leader approaches the heroes with a circular device in his hands.]

Rebel Conqueror: End of the line outlanders!

Aloy: That device is going to call a machine!

[Talanah quickly shots him and Amadis destroys the device, but… a giant machine, Tideripper, emerges from the ocean.]

Talanah: Guess it was too late!

Aloy: Here we go. Chilled to the core. Alright. I think that's the end of it.

Amadis: Hear that?

[Aloy approaches Talanah and Amadis.]

Talanah: Here. Door's locked, but that last rebel had a key on him.

[She opens the gates and finds a few Tenakth there imprisoned.]

Tenakth Soldier: Freed by Garja? Have we not been humiliated enough?

Aloy: It's not their fault you were locked up in your own prison.

Amadis: I'm looking for information about a Carja soldier. She might've been a prisoner here five years back. Her name was Nessa.

Ritakka: The Carja Nessa was here. I killed her myself.

Amadis: Nessa?

[Ritakka stands up and nods to the ober Tenakth.]

Ritakka: I'll handle this. Go secure the grounds.

Amadis: It's you, isn't it? Nessa, how… why--

Ritakka: It's Ritakka.

Aloy: Let me get this straight. You were Nessa? You were brought here as a prisoner during the Red Rates And then became Tenakth?

Ritakka: The Carja forbid women from military service. I lived my life pretending ashamed of who I really was. But the Tenakth measure a soldier only by their strength and resolve. So I took my place among them.

Amadis: Ness-- Ritakka. I've mourned you for five years. Why didn't you let me know you were alive?

Ritakka: I had a new life. I wasn't going back. Not even for you, Amadis.

Aloy: The way Amadis talked about your time together, I thought you'd still care about him.

Ritakka: It was five years ago.

Amadis: I didn't abandon you. Before the battle, I tried to get Gediah to call off the attack, but of course he didn't listen. I ended up killing him.

Ritakka: Then he got what he deserved.

Amadis: I ran for the battlefield to find you. But you were already gone by the time I got there.

Ritakka: I didn't know. But even if I did… I mourned you. And then I moved on.

Aloy: If you were brought here as a prisoner, how did you become Tenakth?

Ritakka: I knew it was only a matter of time before the Tenakth killed me and  the others who were held captive. But one day, one of their soldiers stopped in front of my cell. As he spoke, I realized he was once Carja.

Aloy: Fashav.

Ritakka: I heard how he fell at the Embassy. He deserved a better death than that. The other prisoners he condemned to death. But he convinced the Tenakth to let me fight for my life. I won through blood and blade. I became Ritakka and never looked back.

Aloy: You were willing to wear a disguise so that you could serve in the Carja army. Do you miss being Carja at all?

Ritakka: No. The Red Raids showed me there was no honor in fighting for the Carja.

Ritakka: And when my comrades and I were brought here as prisoners, we knew no one would ever come for us.

Amadis: I would’ve, had I known.

Ritakka: It's better this way. Beneath my Carja armor, I found I had the blood of a Tenakth.

Aloy: So if you became Tenakth, how did you end up as a prisoner here again?

Ritakka: My squad was ordered to retake The Rot from Regalla's rebels. We failed.

Aloy: Considering how much Regalla seems to hate the Carja, I'm surprised her rebels let you live.

Ritakka: You're right. I'd be dead if they knew. But few Tenakth remember who I once was.

Aloy: What will you do now?

Ritakka: You've taken back The Rot. My squad will ensure it stays that way.

Amadis: So this is it? After everything we've been through... this is goodbye?

Ritakka: It has to be. My place will always be here. And yours siback east. I'm sorry that you've suffered. I'll make sure you're granted safe passage out of the Lowland. Consider it Nessa's final farewell. (leaves)

Talanah: At least now you know the truth.

Amadis: Somehow it hurts worse. You must think I'm an idiot.

Talanah: No. I just think you have a lot to figure out. I'll take you back east to the Sundom. After that, I don't know.

Amadis: Talanah, I... understand. I'm sorry it came to this.

Talanah: Me too. Give me and Aloy a moment.

[Amadis walks away.]

Aloy: Are you all right?

Talanah: To be honest, no.

Aloy: What's going to happen between you two?

Talanan: I’m not sure. He clearly has a lot more feelings to sort through. And I won't be anyone's second choice. I want you to have this. For seeing this through with me. No Hawk could ask for a better Thrush. On a better friend!

Aloy: So… I guess this is it, then. You're heading back east.

Talanah: I think I'll hang around Barren Light for a while before returning to Meridian. If you find yourself back that way. Look for me there.

Aloy: I will. Safe travels, Talanah.

[“Need To Know” side quest completed!] 

Aloy: Maybe I should check in with her the next time I'm at Barren Light. Seems like she could use a shoulder to lean on.

[She returns to Bulwark.]

Aloy: First the frost-breath, then the snow. 

[She approaches the pit.]

Aloy: What's going on here?

Erayyo: Close combat training. Fighting at long range is a good strategy for machines. But fighting an enemy soldier means getting up in their face. I'm Erayyo. My bother Virakk and I run this training pit. We watched you bring down the Bulwark. Made our day to see that arrogant commander so furious. You’re welcome to train here. But you're only allowed your spear and a practice bow in the pit. Everything else stays with me. We also offer challenges for any fighters looking to test their skills. Complete all of them and you'll go up against me and Virakk.

Aloy: What happens if I beat you?

Erayyo: I'll grant you a mark to prove you've mastered this training pit. You earn marks from us and the pit masters in Scalding Spear and Thommarsh, you'll earn the right to challenge The Enduring.

Aloy: I think I've heard of The Enduring. Some kind of Tenakth trainer?

Erayyo: Way more than just that. The Enduring is a legendary fighter among the clans. The Master of Masters. Only those who prove themselves in the pits get to train with The Enduring.

Aloy: Including outlanders?

Erayyo: You're no ordinary outlander. So, what do you say? Let me know if you want to practice in the pit or take on a challenge.

[Aloy decides to try out a melee practice.]

Erayyo: You can't win a battle if you're dead. And distance will keep you alive! This combination gets you out of trouble and punishes your enemy.

Erayyo: Survival on the battlefield is down to tactics. Your best target isn't always the closest. So, select your target and strike!

[After some practice Aloy decides to leave Bulwark and explore a little.]

A Soldier’s March (continue)
Aloy: Judging by these markers, that climbing trail Jekkah talked about must be nearby. I should check up on her brother while I'm here.

[She scales the mountain.]

Aloy: Those Tenakth look wounded. What happened?

Tenakth Climber: The way that wind picked up there's bound to be an avalanche.

Aloy: That person looks like they're in charge. I should talk to them.

[She approaches a gayish looking Tenakth wearing woman’s armor and makeup. He even talks in a specific way.]

Wekatta: Wall-breaker. If you've come to witness the March of the Ten, you're out of luck.

Aloy: Actually, I came looking for someone called Penttoh.

Tenakth Climber: Penttoh? That poor scab was as good as dead even before the storm hit.

Wekatta: You're out of line, soldier.

Aloy: What's he talking about?

Wekatta: The kid you're looking for is still up on the mountain, along with two others. Pentton was the only one who decided to break tradition and climb without a partner. His odds aren't good. I'm sorry to say, they never were to begin with. As far as being Tenakth goes, he's got most of it backwards.

Aloy: So what? You're all just waiting here? Shouldn't you be calling for help?

Wekatta: Couldn't find anyone in that storm, even if we wanted to. Those kids are at the mercy of the mountain now.

Aloy: We'll see about that. But first, a couple of questions. Why is everyone so sure this Penttoh can't climb that mountain?

Wekatta: Our people are soldiers. We respect strength and agility. Penttoh has nether. Never has. He's been stuck on cleaning duty since he was a child. Yet he decided to undergo our clan's most difficult trial on his own.

Aloy: And you think he's crazy for trying?

Wekatta: I'm not a fan of that word. When I chose to wear a woman's armor, people called me crazy, too. I guess Penttoh just feels like he has to prove himself. To show who he really is. I understand, believe me. But that climb is hard enough even without a storm.

Aloy: What is this March you mentioned?

Wekatta: This is one of the toughest slopes in Sky Clan territory. It's said that the Ten climbed this mountain in pairs during their war against machines. Our people partner up to earn their soldiers' marks by following a flower that grows on the summit. Until Penttoh that is. He insisted on climbing on his own.

Aloy: You mean no one wanted to climb up with him.

Wekatta: I tried to stop him. But there are technically no rules against it, so I let him pass.

Aloy: That sounds familiar. The Nora have a similar ritual. No one wanted me in that one, either.

Wekatta: Their mistake. I presume.

Aloy: Yep. I could try following the path up the mountain. See if I can find Penttoh. You said there were two other climbers missing as well?

Wekatta: Just one. The other is right there. Zikka.

[A panting Tenakth girl walks up to them.]

Zikka: Rokko and I. We were climbing back down. There was an avalanche - we got separated. I couldn't see anything.

Aloy: Someone's gotta go up there.

Wekatta: You can barely see your own feet in that storm!

Aloy: Except I don't need to. I'll be back.

Aloy: Snowfall's blanketing the land. If the storm gets too rough, I can always use my Focus to find those climbers. I should follow the markers. They'll lead me to the start. Sounds like someone's putting up a fight. 

[She finds a Tenakth fighting a machine.]

Aloy: That Tenakth needs help. They're riled up now.

[Together they kill the beast.]

Rokko: Whoever you are, thanks for the assist! You have my thanks, stranger.

Aloy: You okay?

Rokko: Not really. But I'll live.

Aloy: Your climbing partner - She said you got separated during an avalanche.

Rokko: My partner? Yeah, the avalanche caught us off guard. Swept me up like a twig. I was sure I was a goner. Then someone grabbed hold of me and pulled me out. It was Penttoh. He risked his life for me.

Aloy: Did you see where he went?

Rokko: Up that cliff behind you. Said he was gonna finish the climb. I told him it was suicide. But he wouldn't listen.

Aloy: Can you make it back down on your own?

Rokko: Yes. You're not going after him, are you?

Aloy: Go Get back to Wekatta before the storm gets any worse.

Rokko: May the Ten be with you.

[Aloy continues climbing the snowy mountain.]

Aloy: I have to find Penttoh before he gets himself killed. I should use my Focus to pick up Penttoh's trail. Those must be Penttoh's tracks. Let's hope I can catch up to him. Looks like the avalanche destroyed most of the climbing path. The missing soldier must've climbed up this way. Penttoh made it past here. The path must've collapsed after him. Maybel can glide across. Made it. I should be able to pick up Penttoh's tracks again.

Tenakth Climber: (from afar) Gah! Get out of my way!

Aloy: Let's hope that's Penttoh.

[She finds yet another Tenakth Climber fighting a machine, Leaplasher.]

Aloy: It's fallen! Looks like he could use some help.

Tenakth Climber: Who's there?

Aloy: A friend! Something's interfering with my Focus!

[Together they defeat Leaplasher.]

Tenakth Climber: Thanks for the help, outlander.

Aloy: Penttoh?

Penttoh: Do I know you?

Aloy: Wekatta sent me. We need to get off this mountain, now.

Penttoh: No. I'm not going back there as… as a failure! I am getting that flower no matter what.

Aloy: Look, I know what it's like when your tribe looks down on you but--

Penttoh: Then you understand why I'm either going to get to the top of this mountain, or die on it. Thank you. What are you doing?

Aloy: This climb is meant to be done by two people, right? I'll be your partner.

Penttoh: I'll follow your lead.

[They start climbing.]

Aloy: Looks like the trail carries on here.

Penttoh: You know my name, but I don't think I caught yours.

Aloy: It's... Aloy.

Penttoh: You sure you want to involve yourself with the Bulwark's biggest loser, Aloy?

Aloy: I like to make my own judgements about people.

Penttoh: You know, it's not like everyone can be born with a sword glued to their hand. What was that?

Aloy: I don't know.

Penttoh: Maybe it's just the wind.

Aloy: It's a dead end.

Penttoh: There's a climbing spike left over from the original path.

[Aloy uses her Pullcaster to get across.]

Penttoh: That was amazing!

Aloy: I'll knock this tree down. It should let us reach the climbing path.

Penttoh: Uh. I'll just wait here for you. You won't hear me complaining.

Aloy: We should be able to jump onto that climbing path from the tree.

Penttoh: That's some climbing gear you've got.

Aloy: Thanks. It's time to start climbing.

Penttoh: That doesn't sound like any storm wind I've ever heard.

Aloy: Almost there. This is it.

Penttoh: I can't believe we actually made it.

Aloy: Let's get to that summit, then.

[Suddenly a bear-like machine stands in their way.]

Penttoh: Frostclaw! Just what we need.

Aloy: Shock ammo could help. We can handle it, come on! There.

Penttoh: We got it! Come on! This way, Aloy!

Aloy: Wait up!

[She approaches Penttoh, who crowch near the flower he wanted so badly.]

Aloy: The storm. It's easing up. So. How does it feel to make rank?

Penttoh: Pretty great actually. This… This means everything to me.

Aloy: You know, even if you go back with that, it doesn't mean they'll treat you any different.

Pentton: Honestly, I think. I just needed to prove to myself I could do this.

[Aloy pats his shoulder.]

Penttoh: You should go back. Let the others know I'm okay. I'd like to take a moment if you don't mind. I'll be right behind you.

Aloy: Of course.

Penttoh: Thank you.

Aloy: I can probably reach the bottom of the trail faster if I use my Shieldwing. And get a nice view too. This snow's coming down heavy. Everything looks so peaceful now that the storm has passed. I should be reaching the bottom of the trail soon. Penttoh can't be far behind. There's everyone.

[She returns to the climbers camp.]

Wekatta: Aloy! You have any news?

Jekkah: Please, I need to know what happened to my brother.

Wekatta: Aloy. You return alone.

Rokko: Where is he?

Jekkah: Is my brother?

Penttoh: You can't go crying like that Jekkan. You're the sister of a proper soldier now.

Jekkah: (hugs him) Penttoh!

Penttoh: Ow! I bring you the Blood Crest as proof of my March.

Wekatta: And with my blessing, you join our ranks. May you find your path on the Wings of the Ten.

Tenakth Climber: You've got to be kidding me. Him? A soldier? Please. Flower or no flower, we all know all he'll ever be good for is cleaning everyone's shi--

[Penttoh pushes him so he falls on his ass.]

Wekatta: I think we're done here?

Rokko: (shakes Panttoh’s hand) Better put some snow on that or it'll bruise. Thanks for saving my life. Maybe when I get my own soldier's mark we can fight in the same squad. Give me a chance to return the favor.

Jekkah: He's cute.

Penttoh: Go on. I’ll catch up. (to Aloy) Here Something to commemorate our climb. May the Ten always grant you victory, Aloy.

Aloy: I'll see you around, Penttoh.

[“A Soldier’s March” side quest completed! Aloy saddles her Charger and rides to help someone else.]

Errand: Call and Response (continue)
Aloy: Gerrah said the old watchtower. should be near the falls. Time to tell those soldiers to head home. There's the watchtower. I need to talk to their squad leader, Kivva.

[She finds a woman Tenakth on the lookout.]

Aloy: Are you Kivva?

Kivva: I am. And you - you're the outlander who killed Regalla's champion at the Embassy. Ram Squad was there. We saw your duel. Pivallo still owes me shards.

Aloy: Oh, thanks for the vote of confidence. Chaplain Gerrah sent me. It's time for you to go home. 

Kivva: Gerrah's cracked, then. There's no way our commander will allow us to leave our post. Not after our "insubordination."

Aloy: Things have, uh... changed at the Bulwark. Tekotteh won't be able to stop you.

Kivva: Really? He's finally been taken down a notch? All right then. The last member of Ram Squad is on duty at the tower on the mountain. Let me recall him.

[She blows a horn.]

Kivva: That's odd. Ezekko always answers. One of us will have to go up.

Aloy: I can get up there easily. I'll check on him.

Kivva: Much appreciated. The start of the climb is just across the falls. Try not to break your neck, yeah?

Watchtower Soldier: What's going on?

Kivva: We're moving out. Back to the Bulwark.

Watchtower Soldier: You're shitting me. What about Ezekko?

Kivva: The outlander will check on him.

[Aloy jumps from the lookout and uses her glider.]

Aloy: Falling… gently. This must be the start of the climb. The watchtower should be at the top. Got ya. Now burn! There's some kind of machine circling the watchtower. It's not a good sign. I'm getting closer to the watchtower. Looks like I have to climb higher. That machine could swoop down on me if I'm not careful. I gotta take out these machines before I can look around. Come on, come on. Okay. So where's the soldier assigned to this watchtower? That must be him. 

[She finds Ezekko… dead.]

Aloy: Judging by these wounds, the Skydrifters surprised him. At least it was quick. Kivva sounded her horn. It's a different call from before. I'd better get back down to the watchtower and check on them. The watchtower's under attack! I need to get down there fast. Swooping into battle... those machines are in for a surprise…

Kivva: Blood of the Ten, the outlander glides!

Aloy: Here we go. And now it's an angry flaming machine.

Kivva: Damn things. Thanks for the assist. Is Ezekko on his way down?

Aloy: Actually… Machines got him. Took him by surprise. I'm sorry.

Kivva: What? He was the first of the squad! Our best fighter!

Aloy: He's gone, Kivva. It's just the two of you now.

Kivva: Damn Tekotteh. All we did was go to the Embassy. Follow Chief Hekarro's orders. And what did we get for it? A death sentence dressed up as guard duty. All because Tekotteh has a vendetta against the Chief.

Aloy: Well that ends now.

Kivva: Yeah. Thanks, outlander. Here, this is for you. Pivallo! We're moving out.

[“Call and Response” errand completed!]

Aloy: Tekotteh's an underhanded jerk. But maybe now he'll stop wasting lives over political agendas.

Signal Spike (continue)
[Riding through the steppes Aloy hears a voice…]

Aloy: Well, well well.

Silga: Get away from my rig!

Aloy: The Oseram I met said someone in their crew ran off in this direction. I should keep my eyes open.

Silga: Damned scavengers!

Aloy: Sounds like someone's in trouble.

[She finds an Oceram woman, Silga, fighting a few machines. Aloy decides to intervene.]

Aloy: Looks like it's strong against Shock damage.I think she's gonna need some backup. It's fallen!

Silga: Is it safe? Did they get to it? Please be intact. Please.

Aloy: I should make sure she's okay.

[Silga turns on some device similar to radio.]

Isabel: (via device) 142... supply drop Paul… pray you get… note…

Silga: Yes. It's working.

Isabel: 142... supply drop… Paul… pray you get... note...

Silga: All right. Wire to the spike is still intact. Rig's still playing.

Aloy: You okay, there?

Silga: You took out those machines. I'm grateful, but you should go now. There's nothing to see here.

Aloy: So this “rig” of yours… It's receiving sound through that wire… ...from the thing up on the cliff, what you call a "spike." But the message is only a fragment. And you're trying to pick up the whole thing?

Silga: How did you figure all that out?

Aloy: I've learned a few things in my travels. If you want we could talk about it. Maybe I can help.

Silga: You do seem downright knowledgeable. So go ahead. Shoot.

Aloy: How did you first hear the message?

Silga: I used to be a smith up in the Claim. Wasn't an easy life. A lot of hard work without much to show for it. Then, one day, I heard a whisper coming from a steel rod. Faint, like the last fingers of steam coming off a cooling forge. When I moved the rod around the whispers got louder. I did some tinkering. Built my rig And did my best to follow that sound. Further west I came, the stronger it got. Then I found that spike up there. When I hooked up my rig. the words were clearer than ever.

Aloy: What do you think the message is?

Silga: I don't know. There's something sad about it. Feels like it's from one lost soul to another. I'd sure like to know what it means.

Aloy: Your rig's impressive. How does it work?

Silga: Well, like you said. The spike up there seems to capture the sound. It travels by wire down to my contraption. I put some coils in there. And a light sheet of metal that vibrates, making the sound louder. I'm not exactly sure why it works, but it just does.

Aloy: And you set it up out here all alone?

Silga: I'm not the trusting type. Pretty much everything I do is all alone.

Aloy: You're no ordinary tinker.

Silga: Didn't used to be a tinker at all. More of a metalworker. Came from Mainspring. I can weld a seam so fine you could barely see it. Not that I ever got any credit for it. You see, up there, you've got to be a man to get ahead. I once had a shot at joining a first-rate crew with one of the best forges in the Claim. But I didn't get the job. My own brother wouldn't vouch for me, just because I'm of the female persuasion. Anyhow. At least out here I don't have to worry about any Mainspring men talkin' down to me.

Aloy: Sounds like you're still mad at your brother.

Silga: Somedays I am. Other days I miss him. He’s passed on, you see. He didn't have the guts to go against the blast of the bellows and vouch for a lady, even his own sister. It was cowardly and I told him so. In fact, I told him he weren't my family no more. But over time, I've had cause to regret it. He wasn't a bad sort. He knew how to make me smile, when he wasn't being such a lout.

Aloy: I’m sorry he's gone.

Silga: Yeah, so am I, blast it all.

Aloy: Let me have a look at that "spike." I might be able to pick up more of that message.

Silga: How?

Aloy: Let's just say I have a rig of my own.

Silga: I didn't know Nora were tinkers.

Aloy: They're not But I am, in a way. Be right back.

Silga: Well, okay then. I guess. Just follow the wire to the spike at the top. And please… don't break anything!

[Aloy follows the wire.]

Aloy: Better get climbing. Gotta give her credit, lugging all that wire up a cliff wall. There's the spike. Might get better reception if I'm next to it..

Isabet: (signal) 142... Enduring Victory... supply drop beacon… Paul... pray you get… note…

Aloy: Enduring Victory. Interesting. Can't seem to get a fix on where the signal's coming from though. Well, better let the tinker know I got a bit more of the message.

[She takes a zipline.]

Aloy: This ought to be a good shortcut.

[She goes to Silga.]

Aloy: Your rig is picking up an Old World message - a recording of some kind.

Silga: Thought as much. Did you hear more of it?

Aloy: A bit. It was recorded during a war - a bad one.

Silga: Maybe that's why it sounds so damned sad. There's something about it that makes me think of my late brother, may his ashes stay warm in the forge. Not sure why, exactly.

Aloy: I still can't get a fix on the source.

Silga: Well, the words grew stronger when I got out here...

Aloy: What if you moved the rig now? Try to see if you can get a stronger signal elsewhere?

Silga: Even if I could dodge the Tenakth and the machines, I can't lose that spike. Nothing else pulls down the words better.

Aloy: Okay If it's an Old World message, then let’s try Old World methods. They used to pinpoint signals by listening for them at three different spots. The taller the better. And then they combined the information and used it to find the source.

Silga: And you can do that?

Aloy: I think so. But your "spike" is only one spot. I need two more, both up high.

Silga: Well, there's a big bright tower in the Tenakth territory north of here.

Aloy: Yeah, that should work. I have another spot in mind, near a place I'm… camping.

Silga: Wait. I don't know your name. Or why you'd do all of this for someone you just met.

Aloy: Aloy. And because I want to know what's out there. Same as you.

Silga: Silga. And when you find it, Aloy, I'd be eager to hear what it is.

[Aloy rides to a Tenakth village.]

Aloy: Have to go on foot from here. That tower should help me pinpoint Silga's signal. Get a good glide in. Gotta climb up to look for Silga's signal But where to start? Got to keep climbing to pinpoint that signal. Just a little higher. Almost there. Okay. Let's see if I can pick up Solga’s signal.

Isabel: (signal) Stork 142 to Enduring Victory Reno… supply drop beacon… Paul… I pray you get… note... inside...

Aloy: Well I got more of the message. But not enough to find the source yet. Climbing the mountain where my base is should finish the job.

[She travels to the other location.]

Aloy: Just gotta look for a path. Now that I'm here I should going up the mountain to get more of Silga’s message. The southern face should get me to a good spot. 

[She climbs up a mountain and sees a bunch of machines.]

Aloy: Do I have anything that can hit it with Purgewater? The rope's giving way. Felt that! I have to get higher to try and pinpoint Silga's signal. Gotcha! This mountain is... tall. Looks like I have company. Shocked it! Still need to climb higher. Okay, now to pick up the signal. Where's the best spot? I should try to find a good spot to pick up Silga's message.

Isabel: (signal) Stork-142 to Enduring Victory Reno: Supply drop beacon Echo. Paul, I pray you get this safely. I left a note for you inside.

Aloy: There! Found the signal's origin. It's not too far from here. I just need to get to it. Bet I'll get a nice view if I glide down from here. I'll mark this spot in my Focus. Come back later. My Focus is picking up the signal that Silga found. 

[But some machines guard the entrance.]

Aloy: I'll need to clear out the machines before I can look for the source. Purgewater ammo should do the trick. Pain's subsiding. Got it! I could pick it up! That's it. There you are. Now, how to get to you. But I'll need to deal with these machines first. And now it's an angry flaming machine. It's down! All right. Time to find my way to the signal source. That looks promising. Right. Into the water. 

[She has to swim several meters underwater to get to the source of the signal.]

Aloy: There you are. Now, what's inside.

[She prise open a metal box.]

Isabel: (message) Paul - I couldn't raise you via Focus. I hope this gets to you, somehow, along with the gear for the stand at the Reno line. Just wanted you to know that all the bitterness is water under the bridge. I only remember the good things… ...and I'll think about them when the darkness comes. 

Aloy: Sounds like she really cared about him. Silga will want to know about this. And she'll definitely be interested.

[He returns to Silga.]

Silga: Aloy! The words stopped coming from the spike. What happened?

Aloy: This is what was speaking to your rig. It's Old World equipment used for communicating over long distances. The message must have shut off when I took it. But I heard the “note” the voice was talking about.

Silga: What was it?

Aloy: During an ancient war, a woman was trying to deliver supplies to a man she knew. She wanted him to know that their past disagreements didn't matter in the big picture. That she'd be thinking of him when the end came.

Silga: Oh. I guess she and I are kin, of a sort. I wish I could give my brother a message like that. Tell him that I forgave him. He would've wanted that, I know. This man... the Old One… did he ever hear the message?

Aloy: I don't think so.

Silga: I guess that's often the way of it, then. But still, with the power of that device you found the sender had hope that he might have heard it. What a feat. To send messages near and far. Can I keep this? It's a treasure.

Aloy: Of course.

Silga: Thank you. Sometimes people don't ever get to hear what they should. But with this thing, maybe I can get them talking to one another… from Mainspring all the way to who knows where.

Aloy: Hey, I found a few more things in the supply cache. Might be able to make something out of them. Can I use your workbench?

Silga: Sure. Yean. Right over there. Anytime, Aloy - it's all yours.

Aloy: I think I know just what to do with these parts.

[She uses the workbench.]

Aloy: That turned out well. Can't wait to try it.

[She makes a weapon called Spike Thrower. How ironic. “Call and Response” side quest completed! Aloy decides to visit the Hunting Grounds.]

Ivinna: So you made it. Welcome to the Hunting Grounds. My name is Ivinna. I'm the Caretaker of the Grounds, whether they be used by our soldiers or our Utaru neighbors.

Aloy: Same as the Carja then?

Ivinna: Ah, yes. We’ve heard those cowards claim the idea of Hunting Grounds as their own. But our soldiers have been training in places like this since before the Clan Wars. I'm willing to bet our Trials are beyond anything the Larja would dare face. A skilled hunter like you might actually find them challenging. Rewarding, too. Win our Trials and you'll earn Stripes. That, in turn. will garner you some Medals - remnants of our victory against the Carja during the Red Raids. You can take Medals to the Arena at the Grove, our capital. Its keepers will let you exchange them for the finest weapons and gear our tribe has to offer.

Aloy: I'll keep that in mind.

Ivinna: I should probably also mention our Carver. They make pieces for a popular game of ours. Watching the machines at the Grounds gives them inspiration.

Aloy: You mean Strike?

Ivinna: You know of it? Then maybe you should check out their wares. Carvers almost always have extra pieces to trade for the right resources. I should get going, then T have other Grounds to inspect. But rest assured they will be open to you. Walk with the Ten.

Aloy: Are these your Hunting Grounds?

Ziverra: They are. Try a challenge and we'll see if you live up to your reputation. Just slide down a rope to start. I look forward to seeing you compete.

[Aloy completes a few trials.]

Ziverra: I see you live up to the stories, outlander. Jump down with the ropes and we begin the Trial.

[Aloy completes yet another challenge.]

Ziverra: This is for you.

[All the trials in the Plainsong completed!]

Ziverra: You've got skills. You earned yourself a prize. You should be proud of yourself. The Grounds will be doll without you.

The Roots That Bind (continue)
[Aloy saddles her Charger and rides on until she hears some metal clashes and groans.]

Aloy: Sounds like someone's in trouble.

[She helps the Plainsong warriors.]

Kue: We can't let them defile our home! Remember what you fight for! Push back! Do not let them through! Remember what you are. Don't let them surround you! Protect Riverhymn! 

[With Aloy’s help the Plainsong warriors wins. They cheer and laugh at each other.]

Kue: Save those smiles for your families. The Tenakth understand only strength. And ours was a poor display at best. They will be back. You. The one who actually won this fight for us. A word. I want everyone fortifying the pass!

[Aloy follows Kue.]

Aloy: Your warriors seem…

Kue: Green as early spring? They are children playing with sticks. It's all I can do to keep them alive. It'll only get harder. So far, the rebels have sent mere scouts. But it won't be long till they return for an all-out assault. And if they bring machines with them… we'll need a lot more than eager hearts to win.

Aloy: You seem to know a lot about Tenakth tactics.

Kue: Back when the Tenakth clans pushed back the Carja raiders. I joined the fight. 

Aloy: The Tenakth taught you how to fight?

Kue: More than that, they taught me how to work with metal. I'm probably the only Utaru who can. Never thought I'd be using what I learned then to fight against them now… We may speak freely here.

Aloy: So, what's the plan?

Kue: The plan was making new weapons for my so-called fighters. I sent my best climber, Vaus, up the Drumroot to get the materials we need. Widemaws leave metal pods we use for crafting at its summit. But the Derangement has made them as dangerous as the climb to reach them. Vaus has yet to return. We have defenses to set up. And we are running out of time. If the Savior of Meridian is willing to lend us her strength a little longer - I believe you can get us what we need.

Aloy: You know who I am.

Kue: Red hair. Bow. Fights better than ten warriors put together. You're well-known. And so is your little "disagreement" with The Chorus.

Aloy: Can't Plainsong help?

Kue: Plainsong has abandoned all settlements this far out.

Aloy: Then, why not just leave? You're clearly outnumbered and underequipped. You could leave. Head to safety.

Kue: Have you ever seen a flower so small and white, when it falls, it looks like snow in spring? My daughter called them Wintersong. She carried their seeds to the day she drew her last breath. Now, those seeds grow in the grove at the heart of Riverhymn. planted by my own hands. As do the ones of every brother and sister taken from us during the Red Raids. We… I… will not abandon them.

Aloy: You know Zo?

Kue: I knew the warrior who led the bravest of my tribe against the Carja. But the Zo that came back from the Rout… spends too much time dwelling on things that… just had to be done. I'm not one for regrets.

Aloy: I'm sorry about your daughter.

Kue: The raids took her from me. I found my peace in every Carja that fell beneath my spear. Now all I have left of her is planted in the grove here. No Tenakth will force me out.

Aloy: Do all Utaru carry seeds with them?

Kue: We are given our pouches soon after we're born. When we die, the seeds are buried - a reminder that our deaths bring new life. It is how we remain one with the rhythm of the world.

Aloy: What makes the path up to the Drumroot so dangerous?

Kue: It's a cave of sunken passages and gaping caverns that only the very skilled can navigate. It serves as a safe haven for my people, but machines have patrolled its deepest passageways ever since the Derangement. Even so, Riverhymn and the grove live off its waters. We are connected to it as much as we are to the seeds growing behind you. 

Aloy: I don't think I caught your name.

Kue: Kue. I am the metal weaver of Riverhymn. But all you really need to know about me is that I plan to keep my people alive. Thanks to you, we might actually have a chance at that.

Aloy: Tell me more about these metal pods.

Kue: They are… tricky to collect. The Widemaws sow them. One must be quick enough to gather them before the soil and water take them. But their metal is among the sturdiest I've ever weaved. Without them, our chances of survival are slim.

Aloy: If there's no convincing you to leave… guess we're making some weapons.

Kue: You have my thanks. There's no time to waste. Follow me. This way. With those pods and a whole lot of luck, we just might get out of this alive. Let's hope these sprouts can hold their ground against a squad of machines, I can only cover so much ground and my joints aren't what they used to be.

Aloy: Looked to me like they chose to stay here as much as you did.

Kue: It'll be the fight of their lives, that's for sure. Almost there. This is the best we can do to hide those who cannot fight. But if we fall, the Tenakth will find them sooner than later. We're here. This is it. Do you have any questions?

Aloy: I'm ready.

Kue: Good luck. Come see me at the forge when you're done.

[He leaves. Aloy explores the foot of the mountain trying to find the place to start climbing.]

Aloy: Down to a drizzle. Almost over. Guess I better start finding my way up to the top. I need to find a way up there. Don't think I'm getting anywhere through here. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to climb in this cave. But if there's tunnels up here, there might be some underwater. Maybe they can lead me someplace with a path through these caves. 

[After swimming a little in the underground lake, Aloy finds a corpse.]

Aloy: I'm guessing that's Vaus. These wounds were made by machines. I should take his seed pouch to Kue. It seems to mean a lot to the Utaru.

[She spots a group of Burrowers.]

Aloy: Acid will eat right through that metal. That takes care of that. Now let's find a way up these caves. Here I come. Almost there. Made it. Time to find those Widemaws. This'll be in my stash when I need it. There they are. Those pods they're ejecting, they must be the ones Kue needs. It looks like I can just pick them up once they fall to the ground. If I'm quiet enough, I can get them without the machines ever knowing I'm here. Don't think I can override you. Guess there are more Cauldrons out there. Fire's wasted on that machine. Got it. Ha-ha! This one should do. Shocked and locked! There we go. That should do it. Better get back to Kue with these. 

[She returns to Kue.]

Aloy: I got what you needed.

Kue: Not a moment too soon. Did you find Vaus?

Aloy: I… brought his seed pouch back.

Kue: I pray it'll be the last I bury. But now I need to get the weapons ready.

Aloy: Let's hope it'll be enough.

Kue: It'll have to be. 

[He begins to forge weapons. After a while, the green recruits come out in their new armor and weapons. They look, it must be said, quite intimidating. And just at that moment they are attacked by the Tenakth!]

Kue: Everyone stay behind cover until I give the signal!

Aloy: Utaru! For Riverhymn!

Kue: Utaru! For Riverhymn!

Utaru Archer: For Riverhymn!

Aloy: For Riverhymn!

Utaru Archer: For Riverhymn!

Utaru Archer: Our people need us!

Kue: Riders! Archers at the ready! Aloy!

Aloy: I'm on it!

Utaru Archer: This is our home!

Aloy: Got it! Acid's all over it.

Utaru Archer: Protect the seeds of the fallen!

Utaru Archer: You are not welcome here!

[The intense battle finally comes to an end and the Plainsong warriors claim their victory.]

Kue: Guess these young ones knew how to aim after all. Even so, we owe you this victory, huntress.

Aloy: It wasn't my strategy or craft that got us here, Kue. I just brought in some parts.

Kue: Even so, I want you to have this.

[He hands Aloy a nice looking bow.]

Kue: It did good by my people, it'll do good by you.

Aloy: I'll take good care of it.

Kue: Be safe out there.

[“The Roots That Bind” side quest completed!]

Kue: The first bloom of the Wintersong. I can feel the heaviness of my years fade away just by looking at them.

Aloy: They're beautiful.

Kue: It was good to see the young ones fight for this place.

Kue: Strong as the roots of a proud tree. Just don't tell them I said that.

Aloy: Your secret's safe.

Kue: Now, I better make sure our newly victorious "warriors" don't injure themselves while celebrating.

[Aloy travels to Scalding Spear and visits their training pit.]

Aloy: Is this a training pit?

Lirokkeh: It is. Sounds like you've been to one of the other clan's capitals. I'm Lirokkeh. I run this training pit for the Desert Clan. Only a few outlanders have ever made it out this far west. But from what I've heard, you're a pretty good fighter. Anyway, if you've been to another clan's training pit, then you must know the drill. Same rules apply here. You can train or take on a challenge. Only your spear and a practice bow are allowed in the pit. Complete all of my challenges and you can spar with me.

Aloy: And when I beat you, I'll earn a mark?

Lirokkeh: If. And yes. A token of victory to present to The Enduring.

Aloy: Who is this Enduring, exactly? All I've heard is that they're the best trainer amongst the Tenakth.

Lirokkeh: Earn three marks. Then you'll see. 

[Aloy starts the training.]

Lirokkeh: Just as you can combine single attacks, you can also chain combinations. Try it with this one. Here's something different. I want you to practice using Aerial Slash to chain into an Aerial Shot. You have learned. You delivered that well. Now that was an attack! All right! I yield! That was a good fight. Pretty sure I'll have a bruise to remember it by. Here, a mark as promised.

Aloy: Thanks. One down, I guess.

Lirokkeh: Go to the training pits in the Bulwark and Thornmarsh. Earn their marks. Then you can challenge The Enduring. Few have ever done so, but think you might have a shot. And if you want to train more or take on another challenge, let me know. The pit will always welcome you. 

Aloy: That's enough practice for now. 

Lirokkeh: Strike true as the Ten.

The Deluge
Aloy: You wanted to speak to me?

Zokkah: The name's Zokkah. Have you heard from up north? From Bleeding Mark?

Aloy: I'm guessing that's a place?

Zokkah: One of the Desert's villages over there can mark the skin of our soldiers. But it's been a long time since the last supply run. Too long.

Aloy: If you think something happened to them can't you send someone to go check?

Zokkah: Were it up to me. But the capital's already dealing with machines, storms, and strict water rations. No one can be spared.

Aloy: You mentioned the village up north sends some supplies to the capital - ashblood?

Zokkah: It's a crimson stone that we grind into powder for our ink. Bleeding Mark has the largest supply. Our soldiers there gather and deliver it to us, in exchange for their water rations.

Aloy: Dye for water.

Zokkah: Everyone in the clan depends on the Wound in the Sand for their water Capital and outlying village alike. But the last delivery of ashblood was weeks ago. Our supply is running low - so must be their water.

[Aloy decides to trade with Zokkah.]

Zokkah: My face paint will strike fear in your enemies. Take a look.

Aloy: If I'm out that way. I can look in on the village. Find out what's the delay.

Zokkah: You have my thanks. Head north to a ruin where the desert meets the mountains. That's Bleeding Mark. Ask for Kentokk or Natikka there. They'll know what's going on.

[Aloy saddles her Charger and rides towards the desert.]

Aloy: Shieldwing's holding up. This Greenshine might trade for something good. This Greenshine might trade for something good. Got to repair the data I have on Plowhorns before I can override them. Ahh. Got a piece of it!

[She finds the village.]

Aloy: This must be the village Zokkah was talking about. Looks like the whole place flooded. Maybe from a recent storm. Wonder if anyone made it out Best check around the shore.

Tenakth Survivor: Can anyone hear us?

[Aloy jumps into the water and swims toward the voice.]

Aloy: The water feels… thick. Polluted. Where are you?

Tenakth Survivor: We're trapped in this tower! Flood blocked the way we came in. There's a ladder at the top but we can't reach it.

Aloy: Okay! I'll find a way to get to you. I need to get to the ladder at the top of the building. Maybe there's a way to crossover from the broken one next to it? There's the ladder on the other building. I can make that jump. It looks like it's stuck. Maybe I can use my weight to make it drop?

[She jumps on the ladder, but…]

Aloy: Whoa!

[It was rusted out and falls, leaving Aloy trapped with the survivors.]

Tenakth Survivor: No! That was our only way out.

Aloy: Everyone okay?

Tenakth Survivor: You're not one of us. Sorry - yes. We took shelter in here when a mudslide swept through the village, but debris blocked the passage we came in through. That ladder was our only way out, but we couldn't reach it from here.

Aloy: Don't worry. I'll find us another way out of here.

Tenakth Survivor: Do you know what happened to the others? Before we run in here, I thought I saw a few of our comrades climbing up a watchtower on the north side, near the grotto.

Aloy: I'll look into it. Can you make it to the shore from here?

Tenakth Survivor: If you find us a way out, we'll make it.

Aloy: Okay. Sit tight for now.

[She uses her Pullcaster and makes her way up the building dropping iron bars and then rips out the ventilation door.]

Aloy: That should do it. Okay! You should have a way out!

Tenakth Survivor: Thanks! We'll head to the shore in a moment.

Aloy: Okay, better find this watchtower on the north end. There are more survivors on that overlook. Must be where Natikka is.

[She finds two survivors.]

Natikka: Keep the pressure on it.

Aloy: Is he all right?

Natikka: He will be.

Tenakth Survivor: But what about the others?

Natikka: There. Let me worry about that. Rest now. (to Aloy) I'm Natikka. You're a long way from the East, outlander.

Aloy: You're Natikka? So this must be Bleeding Mark.

Natikka: What's left of it. How do you know of this place?

Aloy: The Inker's apprentice in Scalding Spear told me to find you. He was worried something happened to your supply caravan.

Natikka: Well, as you can see, we have more important problems than delivering ashblood.

Aloy: What happened here?

Natikka: The last storm caused a deluge that brought down half of the mountain. The mudslide barreled right through the village. I hear we have you to thank for getting these soldiers to safety. But there are others still missing. And I need to keep watch here.

Aloy: Then I'll take another look around. If I find anyone else. I'll send them your way.

Natikka: Much appreciated. And if you see an older soldier, grim-faced, goes by Kentokk - tell him… Tell him I'm here.

[Aloy starts searching for the other survivors.]

Tenakth Survivor: We've got wounded up here. Need an easy way down! Ah! And fast!

Aloy: Hold on, I'll figure something out! I need to find a way for the Tenakth to get down from the cliff. That big crane could help. If I can get it into the right position, I could make a bridge for them. That rubble's blocking the base of the crane. Maybe I can clear it if I pull that beam out. Well, the crane moved a little but it must be stuck on something else Underwater maybe? My Focus can help me search. Okay. Crane's in place. Now how to lower it to reach the cliff? Looks like there's something weighing the arm down. I've got to get out of the water to get a better look at it. Pulling it this way's not working. Don't think I can pull the beam from here. I have to get up higher. There we go! Damn it. Arm's stuck on something. Better climb up and take a look. If I detach those cables, the arm should drop the rest of the way. This thing's about to drop, watch out!

Tenakth Survivor: Blood of the Ten! How'd you manage to do that? I don't know how you did it, but thanks for the rescue.

Aloy: Is everyone okay?

Tenakth Survivor: His leg snapped against some debris as we were making a run for it. But he'll live.

Aloy: How'd you get stuck up here?

Tenakth Survivor: A mudslide tore through the village in the last storm. This ledge was just above the flood when we got to it. But by the time everything calmed down, the water had receded, leaving us stranded. And we couldn't leave a fellow soldier behind.

Aloy: Can you make it to the shore from here? Natikka's there, tending to the wounded.

Tenakth Survivor: Natikka? Thank the Ten. We'll head for her location - she'll know what we should do next. If you're looking for survivors, I thought I heard shouting on the north end by the grotto. You might want to check there.

Aloy: Thanks. I'll look into it.

[She notices some machines in the distance.]

Aloy: Do I have any Fire ammo on me? Didn't see anyone who looked like Kentokk. Maybe he's with the other survivors. Ha-ha!

Tenakth Survivor: Crush them with the boulders! Shoot the support beam!

Aloy: Those boulders. Break the support beam, crush the machines. Got your attention now! 

[She defeats some heavy machines.]

Aloy: There. Should be safe for the Tenakth now.

Tenakth Survivor: We're coming down!

Aloy: It's always good to have extra. Is everyone okay?

Tenakth Survivor: Better now, without Snapmaws prowling around. You sure know how to fight.

Aloy: Have you seen Kentokk? Natikka asked me to keep an eye out for him.

Tenakth Survivor: Last I saw him was before the mudslide hit.

Aloy: Okay. Head for the shore on the other side of the village. Natikka's there with the other survivors.

Tenakth Survivor: Will do. Thanks again.

[Aloy returns to Natikka.]

Natikka: (to a survivor) We will. But you will lie back down and rest.

Aloy: Washed off some of the sweat.

Natikka: Rest now. Aloy. Thanks to you, these soldiers are safe. But… where's Kentokk?

Aloy: I didn't see anyone who matched his description. Do you know where he was when the storm hit?

Natikka: I was the last one to see him, just before I told him I wanted to leave this place, to pledge my blade to the Chief's Guard. But he refused to discharge me from the squad. All Tenakth are stubborn fighters, but Kentokk is more so than most. So I walked out. I was coming back from the opposite ridge when I saw the mudslide.

Aloy: You were coming back to make amends.

Natikka: I must find him. If anyone can survive such a storm, it's him.

Aloy: You said Kentokk is your squad leader?

Natikka: I've trained under him ever since I was assigned to his squad. But… my blade is quicker, deadlier, because of him.

Aloy: To serve something greater than yourself.

Natikka: Yes. And yet he wants me to be tethered to this place, rather than fulfilling a greater purpose with the Chief's Guard.

Aloy: You said you wanted to pledge your blade to the Chief's Guard. Is that what the Marshals are?

Natikka: No. The Marshals travel the breadth of the Clan Lands, enacting Chief Hekarro's will. The Guard remains at the Grove to defend it and the Chief. But like the Marshals, only a handful are chosen for such an honor.

Aloy: So why did Kentokk not want you to go?

Natikka: He claimed that the greater honor was to serve my squad and clan.

Natikka: But all we do here is gather supplies for ink. How can that compare to guarding the Grove, the Chief himself?

Aloy: So a mudslide did all this? Must've been quite a storm.

Natikka: We've had more and more of them over the last few years. Torrential rain, Lightning strikes, winds that rattle the metal towers. But this last one was the worst yet. This area used to be as arid as the rest of the desert. The storms have changed all that. But for all this water, we still rely on the capital for our supply.

Aloy: Why's that?

Natikka: This water's poisoned by ashblood. Undrinkable as machine oil.

Aloy: The Inker's apprentice in Scalding Spear mentioned you exchange ashblood for water.

Natikka: It's the way of the desert. Where other villages hunt for food or machine parts to trade with the capital, we… collect rocks. Important rocks. The clan relies on ashblood to mark their skin. How can they record their glories without our supply?

Aloy: I can take another look around the village. Where did you last see--

Tenakth Survivor: Natikka?

Natikka: I'm here.

Tenakth Survivor: Where's Kentokk? Did he make it?

Natikka: We're going to find him.

Tenakth Survivor: He saved me. Pushed me out of the way as everything collapsed. But then the flood took him. Towards the Gouge.

Aloy: "The Gouge"?

Natikka: It's an ancient passage that leads deep underground. Come, I'll show you.

Tenakth Survivor: Natikka, we need orders. We’re exposed out here. Only half of us can hold a blade if machines come. 

Tenakth Survivor: What do you want us to do?

Natikka: (to Aloy) Go. The Gouge is in the hillside, northwest of here. I'll catch up when I can.

Tenakth Survivor: What are we going to do now?

Natikka: Let's get a couple soldiers posted as lookouts to start.

Tenakth Survivor: Understood.

[And Aloy has to do it alone. She saddles a Bristleback and rides on.]

Aloy: That must be the Gouge. Looks like an old mine. There's a lot of debris blocking the entrance. Maybe Kentokk got swept in there during the flood. I'm gonna have to clear some of it to get inside. 

[She destroys the pile of rubble blocking the entrance to the Gouge.]

Aloy: There we go. Time to head in. Okay. Let's see where this leads. 

[She finds a heavily injured Tenakth.]

Aloy: Take it easy. You must be Kentokk.

Kentokk: How… how does an outlander know my name?

Aloy: Natikka sent me to find you. The soldier you saved told us you were swept away by the mudslide.

Kentokk: So he made it. Good. And Natikka… she came back?

Aloy: Yeah. She was on her way back to talk to you when the mudslide happened. She's looking after the survivors now.

Kentokk: It was my mistake to deny her discharge. A soldier is supposed to sacrifice for the good of the tribe. Looking back now… she was right. I didn't want to let her go. The Chief's Guard will gain an invaluable soldier. At least after all this. I won't be in the way anymore. I can tell you know a fatal wound when you see one. My service to my clan is done. So leave me.

Aloy: No, you're not going to die down here. There has to be a way to get you out.

Kentokk: There isn't. I tried to climb out, but it's no use. The walls are too slick.

Aloy: Water's coming in from the surface? But not from where I came in. There must be another source. And if I find it and open it up. You might not be able to move Kentokk but I think there might be a way to move your. Hey. Hey! I need you to stay awake. I'm going to take a look around.

Kentokk: (weak laugh) You're just like Natikka. Relentless as a Fireclaw.

Aloy: Then you should be used to it. Just… sit tight. I'm going to get you out of here. That waterfall must be coming from somewhere. I need to get higher up to figure out where it's coming from. I'm too close. Water's coming from that vent. Dead end. There must be another source. There's some metal in that wall across the way. Might be able to pull some of it out. There. I think I can reach the other side now. Okay. The waterfall I saw down below should be coming in from somewhere around here. Got to find its source. Water's coming in from there. I can use the Firegleam to break open that wall and this whole place should flood.

[She returns to the platform where Kentokk lies.]

Kentokk: What did you do?

Aloy: I found us a way out. Almost there. Hey, stay with me.

Kentokk: Tell Natikka--

Aloy: You tell her yourself. She said you're a stubborn fighter. So keep fighting.

[The platform rises to the top of the shaft. Aloy helps Kentokk walks out, but he falls on the ground.]

Natikka: Kentokk!

[He looks at Natikka one last time and dies.]

Aloy: He wanted me to tell you, “A blade answers only to the hand that commands it.”

Natikka: He would say that every time we sparred. Sometimes as an insult. Other times as a compliment. But I guess… he was right. It was always my choice to stay or go.

Aloy: I'm sorry you didn't get to make amends.

Natikka: So am I.

Aloy: What will you do now?

Natikka: I'm not sure. Bleeding Mark has a chance to recover. And once that's done. I could join the Chief's Guard… But I have to lay him to rest first. With full soldier's honors.

[Aloy walks away.]

Natikka: Aloy, wait. You saved my comrades, somehow drained the entire village… I want you to have this.

Aloy: Thanks And good luck, whatever you decide.

[“The Deluge” side quest completed! After resting a night over the campfire Aloy rides on.]

THE SEA OF SANDS
Aloy: Looks like an Oseram camp. But where is everyone? My Focus might show me more. A Behemoth could bring down a mountain if it wanted to. This must be the ruins of Las Vegas. POSEIDON shouldn't be far. GAIA said this is where I'd find POSEIDON, but the ruins out here are exposed to the elements. But a lot of them are buried in the sand. So maybe POSEIDON is underground. If that's true, I might be able to find a way down through one of these structures. A drone. Must be part of PSICLOPS. If I can get its data I can reconnect it with the dome back at the base. But how to get up there? Water's pouring out of that building! POSEIDON's doing? I better check it out.

[She enters the Chinese looking building titled The Tower of Tears.]

Aloy: Someone's been through here. Camping gear? Looks like there's something behind that tarp.

[She sees three Oseram and hides behind a column.]

Morlund: Oh, I’m almost had ‘em! I was so close!

Abadund: To drowning, maybe! Not to the Embers! Morlund, it's over!

Morlund: Not for me it's not!

Abadund: Then you're going to die. Alone. Because we're not sticking around to fish out the corpse. We're through.

Stemmur: "And so the Visionary's fate hung in the balance… Would he choose life, or succumb to deadly delusion…?"

Aloy: Heh-hem! Hello. So… there's an ancient city under the sand, but it's flooded?

Stemmur: "Suddenly, a Nora spear-maiden appeared."

Aloy: Yeah, okay, um… Well, you're not typical delvers, that's for sure. What's this?

Morlund: I call it a "diving bubble." This is the Mark One. The Mark Two was better, but it got stuck halfway down. The air tube snagged.

Aloy: You went down in that?

Morlund: Yeah, I'd hardly expect a layperson to understand.

Aloy: Because that's pretty smart.

Abadund: Uh, I'm sorry. May I remind you. You got stuck inside and nearly drowned!

Aloy: It'd have to be portable, though. Mm… Machine knee cap, maybe?

Morlund: Well, you'd need a filter.

Aloy: Synthetic membrane would do it. With a hose to a--

Aloy & Morlund: --compressed air capsule.

Morlund: Hammer and tongs.

Abadund: What is this, what is happening here? What. Get over here. She's a stranger!

Morlund: You got a name?

Aloy: Aloy.

Morlund: Morlund. Not a stranger anymore.

Abadund: You're a damned fool!

Morlund: Come on! I've got the original schematics over here…

Aloy: Oh. Um. Ah. Well, hold on. Just a couple of questions first.

Morlund: Fair enough… partner.

Abadund: Partner?!

Morlund: Don't mind him.

Aloy: What's so important down there that you'd risk your life?

Morlund: Uh, well…

Aloy: Morlund, I'm not interested in salvage, okay? Whatever you find below is yours.

Morlund: All right. Then what if I told you we were delving for the most. No nonsense. I like it. Behold. An Ember. 

[He takes out what looks like a small jar-like device with a thick glass lid.]

Aloy: Looks like a piece of junk.

Morlund: Well, now, yes. But with a proper spark, these magnificent creations of the Old Ones paint mesmerizing pictures in the air. And the ruins below us are full of 'em! A feast for the eyes beyond description! Just as my old gramps promised me.

Aloy: How did your grandfather discover these Embers?

Morlund: He was here! Forty-odd years ago. He was one of the first to lead a delving party into the West. He discovered the ancient city around us… …plumbed the depths of this very structure. He found the hollow underneath… and the glowing Embers all about! He took as many as he could and brought them home. He always wanted to come back and get more, but, well, he never scraped up the shards. What he really wanted to do was use the Embers to put on a show. One unlike the world has ever seen.

Aloy: Sounds like quite a guy.

Morlund: He was a true delver and a true showman. And I miss him. But I will do him proud. I will gather the Embers and put on a spectacle that would have amazed even him. …with your help, of course.

Aloy: So these "Embers" project images?

Morlund: Paintings of light. Amazing stuff! This one showed the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, beckoning all to a buffet of lobster and succulent beeves. I must have watched it about a hundred times as a child in my old gramps' workshop.

Aloy: What happened to it?

Morlund: Over time they die out. I cried the day that this one's light faltered. But there are many more below, as you'll see. If you get down there like I did and my old gramps before me.

Aloy: So, what exactly happened down there?

Morlund: It was a delve like no other… a chance to follow in my old gramps' footsteps. Beneath this structure here is an enormous… hollow… a dome, protected from the sands. We built this elevator here to ensure easy egress and exit. It's quite a contraption, actually, and not so easy to--

Aloy: Right. Again. What happened?

Morlund: At the bottom… We beheld the treasure my gramps first discovered - painted images in the air of every description. Dancing women. Games and coins and promises of "jack-pots" - I don't know what that is, but it's got to be good! But then, something went wrong. The images turned… nautical. Waves went through them. Even fish. It was like a strange underwater dream.

Aloy: POSEIDON's dream.

Morlund: Yes, well. Suddenly, there was this terrible rushing sound… and then an explosion of water erupted from the floor!

Aloy: So, water just shot up from the floor and filled the place up?

Morlund: It was a raging flood unlike anything. I've seen. We ran like forge-fire and barely made it up the elevator as a wave just crashed beneath us. Shaken but not stirred, I built the diving bubbles, Mark One and Mark Two. I tried the descent in each… but I nearly drowned both times. Abadund's beside himself - he thinks I'm insane. But I can't give up now. I've come too far. And the Embers are just barely within my reach.

Aloy: Well, maybe I can help.

Morlund: Yeah. Maybe you can.

Aloy: You guys don't seem like average delvers.

Morlund: We're not really delvers at all. We're showmen.

Aloy: Like… performers?

Morlund: You're Nora, and thus unfamiliar with the arts. We stage spectacles, all around the Claim. Stemmur tells stories, which I augment with all manner of sounds and fireworks. And Abadund, he… well…

Aloy: Complains?

Morlund: Handles the money, which amounts to about the same thing.

Morlund: When we delve, it's to find gear for my theatrics. Which makes this delve the most important one of all.

Aloy: How deep is it? Can't I just swim down?

Morlund: Only if you have gills. You can stack fifty kegs in that shaft.

Aloy: Leave it to the Oseram to measure something in kegs.

Morlund: We're talking liquid depth. I'd say it's apt.

Aloy: Apt or not, sounds too deep to hold my breath.

Morlund: Hence, our new invention!

Aloy: I'd better get after those parts.

Morlund: There's a fully intact compressed air capsule in the Mark Two, but like I said, it's stuck in the shaft.

Aloy: If you made it back up alive, I should be able to swim down that far.

Morlund: All right. As for the other parts, Stemmur scouted a herd due south of here that should have what we need.

Aloy: I'm on it.

Morlund: Great. Well, come back when you get the gear. Good hunting!

[Aloy decides to talk to Abadund.]

Abadund: Probably get a guest list of fifty, so we'd need… At least three dozen kegs. Brown ale maybe… no. For him. Scrappersap.

Aloy: Are you… planning a party?

Abadund: Budgeting for Morlund's funeral, thanks to you! I was this close. We were going to move on, leave all this nonsense behind. Then you come along and you spark your wet-noodle idea!

Aloy: It's going to work.

Abadund: I've heard that before.

Aloy: So, uh, how does someone like you end up working for someone like Morlund?

Abadund: I work WITH Morlund. We got three equal claims in this venture. I saw one of his early shows, back when it was just him and his inventions. Works of flame, lights and shadows, all kinds of gizmos. Never seen the like. But the man is all spectacle, no sense. Bleeds shards like… like… You get the idea. Without me to handle the finances, his dreams would be sunk. More sunk. Wish we were back in the Claim! Plenty of normal shows to do without the salvage from this blasted place.

Aloy: And yet you're here, in the middle of the desert, delving for his dream.

Abadund: It was a good one. But sometimes a dream has to die.

Aloy: This dream of Morlund's…

Abadund: Is going to get him killed.

Aloy: Let's say it doesn't. What happens after he gets the salvage down there?

Abadund: We'll have special seating, premium ale, the works! Morlund will do his light spectacle… thing. Stemmur will get their eyes a’sparklin' with his tales, and I'll be selling tickets. It's a nice thought, anyway.

Aloy: Morlund mentioned you were showmen…

Abadund: What? An Oseram can't be anything other than a delver, tinker, or drunkard? Okay sure, we are delvers too, but that is not our main source of income. Mostly… We go town to town. Putting on shows.

Aloy: These shows. What are they? What happens at them?

Abadund: Tales and spectacle. Morlund's got the technical know-how. Builds all manner of inventions: whirligigs of light and sound, cannons that shoot fire and showers of sparks… and Stemmur-- "Keeps them enthralled with tales of adventure in the smoothest baritone." Yeah. That.

Aloy: And you?

Abadund: Me? Who do you think handles the financials for the whole blasted thing? Those two might have the sparks, but do you think they know their way around shards? Hah! No, they don't.

Aloy: So, Morlund was down in this ancient city. You?

Abadund: I can delve too!

Aloy: Right. And then what happened?

Abadund: What do you think? Water rushed in. We ran. Then Morlund built that blasted thing. Nearly got himself drowned. Twice. You want the finer details of his stupidity, you go ask him. 

[Aloy decides to trade with Abadund.]

Abadund: I'm always willing to engage in some commerce.

Aloy: I'll leave you alone.

Abadund: Do us a favor. Leave us all alone.

[And now Aloy goes to the strangest man of the three, Stemmur.]

Stemmur: "The stouthearted huntress approached, her appearance as sudden as a spark of destiny, when the delve was at its direst."

Aloy: That's… quite the introduction.

Stemmur: Mm. Maybe a little internal thyme, instead? “A maiden arose from the very sands that bore our woes…” Nah. Too trite.

Aloy: What is it with you and all the words?

Stemmur: That's what I do. "The stalwart storyteller gazed upon the maiden with well-earned pride in his life's work…" Stemmur Wordsmith, at your service.

Aloy: How did you end up following Morlund out here?

Stemmur: "Bright-eyed Morlund held his dreams aloft like a burning candle. And where that light went the hearts of men were sure to follow."

Aloy: So… you admire him?

Stemmur: "Admiration is but a gentle fire. It's a spark that delvers, tinkers and rogues alike are sure to warm to."

Aloy: Okay, guess that answers something. Your friend over there doesn't like me too much - the loud one.

Stemmur: "The old bean-counter has the personality of a moss-eaten rock. But oh, what a wicked mind for money… …and a memory as long as life for even the smallest debt."

Abadund: By that he means he owes me shards. 147 to be exact.

Stemmur: "But as sharp as he was in things pecuniary… he had a dull forgetfulness for how many times a certain Wordsmith, saved his hoary hide."

Abadund: 147… 147…

Aloy: What exactly does a wordsmith do?

Stemmur: "Like a tinker at the forge, a Wordsmith hammers out words to entrance all who hear them… …the young, the old, and frequently, the inebriated."

Aloy: I didn't take the Oseram for storytellers.

Stemmur: They say the only thing that makes a cold brew go down easier is a tale of times gone by…

Morlund: …but it's always best to hit the road before the keg runs dry.

[They laugh and bump their fists.]

Aloy: Why's that?

Stemmur: Oh, well, the Oseram can get mighty agitated if they run out of drink. Or if they don't like your story.

Aloy: So you're saying being a Wordsmith can be dangerous?

Stemmur: Oh, yeah. Story goes the wrong way, Oseram'll throw stuff at you.

Aloy: What, like, fruit?

Stemmur: More like chairs. Or grenades. "But the veteran Wordsmith persevered through it all, hammer in hand, ready to give as good as he got." How do you think we got here all the way from the Claim anyway, past those blasted machines? It wasn't by talkin'.

Aloy: Got to go see someone about an underwater city.

Stemmur: "And lo, the huntress went forth."

Morlund: What can I do for you, partner?

Aloy: I need to get going.

Morlund: Well, then. I won't stop you!

[Aloy starts exploring the plays and overhears some words.]

Abadund: I thought we were finally going to get away from this place.

Morlund: Well, good thing that Aloy showed up.

Abadund: We'll see.

Stemmur: The longer their sojourn in the desert, the crustier the shard-counter's mood became."

[Aloy leaves the Tower.]

Aloy: According to Morund, the nerd should be south of here. This'll be in my stash when I need it. Well, this is where Morlund said the herd would be. They must've moved on… need to pick up their trail. Better look for tracks. There. Tracks should lead me to the nerd. This must be where the herd left from. I better follow the tracks in the other direction. There's the herd. They should have the parts I need. Fire's not going to help here. More machines! Better deal with them first. Oh, the storm's whipped up a sand spiral. Great. Okay. Got them all. Now where did the herd go? It looks like the herd's caught between those sand spirals. I could use that to my advantage. Frost won't help here. Machine was born for the cold. Come on, come on. A Knee Cap. Good. One Synthetic Membrane. Okay, that takes care of the machine parts. Just gotta grab the Compressed Air Capsule from Morlund's diving bubble.

[After collecting all the necessary components, she returns to the Tower.]

Abadund: I thought we were finally going to get away from this place.

Morlund: Well, good thing that Aloy showed up.

Abadund: We'll see.

Stemmur: "The longer their sojourn in the desert, the crustier the shard-counter's mood became."

Aloy: Got the Compressed Air Capsule. I should have all the parts to build this thing now. Better get back to Morlund.

Morlund: What can I do for you, partner?

Aloy: I've got everything I need to build the… uh…

Morlund: "The Incredible Diving Mask."

Aloy: I think "Diving Mask" is enough.

Morlund: I won't quibble. The workbench is all yours! 

[Aloy crafts the Diving Mask.]

Morlund: Wow. There's a marvel. If it works, you'll let me try it? I want to get down there and get those Embers.

Aloy: Assuming I don't drown.

Morlund: So, what are you really looking for down there?

Aloy: It's hard to explain. Something that caused a malfunction in the apparatus that controls the old city. I think it started the flood.

Morlund: Well, I thought we started the flood. Like we sprung a trap. I don't know how we were detected. Like I said, the dancing lights around us changed. Turned to sea-life. There was this flash of red. And the roar of water surging in.

Aloy: Wait. A flash of red?

Morlund: A red light from a spot near the grate on the floor where the water burst through. It was like a beacon

Aloy: Or a warning. Thanks. That might help.

Morlund: I hope it does. And good luck down there!

[It’s time to dive in!]

Aloy: Okay. Time to see if this thing works. 

[She jumps into the water.]

Aloy: (underwater) So far so good! I can actually breathe down here. Diving Mask seems to be holding up. I've never been able to swim this deep before. Nautical lights. Must be POSEIDON's doing. That looks like a way out. POSEIDON's down here, somewhere. Got to find where it's hiding.

[She swims into a flooded building. A huge car that looks like a Leopleurodon floats by her. It even roars!]

Aloy: (underwater) Whoa! Big machine! There's no way I can fight that thing underwater. I'll have to be careful… This place is massive. And all of it's encased in a dome? That door on the other side. The coordinates for POSEIDON lead there. I don't think I can get to it without the machine spotting me. I gotta find a way to deal with it first. Morlund said he saw a red light near the floor when the water rushed in. Almost like a waктing… from some kind of alarm system? There. Red light.

[She swims to the console and pushes a button.]

Synthetic Voice: Alert Critical flooding detected. Automatic drainage controls offline. To execute an emergency purge, manual reset of primary and secondary pump nodes is required. The purge can then be triggered at the Pump Maintenance Station. 

Aloy: (underwater) If I do this purge and drain all the water, I can fight that big machine on dry ground. Looks like I have to reset a couple of pump nodes first. According to the map, there should be an access point for the first node south of here. More machines down here. I'll have to swim around them, stick to cover. Fire could hurt it. There's the access point. Should lead me to the pump node. There must be a whole network of these tunnels down here. Water lines for an entire city. I can't reach the ledge from here. Maybe there's something I can climb to get out?

[Finally she finds a place to stand on her two feet and breathe out.]

Aloy: Hot. I’m sweating everywhere.

[She finds a large valve and spins it.]

Aloy: There. One node down. Better swim back up and find the access point for the second node.

[Back to the water.]

Aloy: (underwater) According to the map, the second node should be on the other side of the dome. Another access point. Should get me to the second node.

[After a while, she finds another tunnel and gets out of the water. However, the second valve refuses to turn.]

Aloy: It won't budge. Maybe that debris is weighing it down?

[She destroys the debris.]

Aloy: Okay. Let's see if that helped.

[This time the valve decides to cooperate.]

Aloy: Okay. I've taken care of both nodes. Now I just need to activate the emergency purge at the Maintenance Station.

[Back to the water again.]

Aloy: (underwater) According to the map, the Maintenance Station should be at the south end of the dome.

[She hides from the water machines.]

Aloy: (underwater) Move along now… There's red light in that tower… just like at the console I found earlier. That might be the Maintenance Station. But how to get in? It looks like part of this building collapsed. There might be a way in. I think I'm in the Maintenance Station now. I just got to find a console to activate the emergency purge. Get this from my stash when I need it. This looks promising. There should be a console in here. There. Time to dry this place out.

[She presses the button on the console and… The water, which has stood for hundreds of years, begins to flow out of the room, leaving behind the debris floating in it. Aloy takes off the Diving Mask.]

Aloy: That did it! (laughs) Okay. Now I can deal with that machine guarding the door on the other end of the dome. And once I get past it, I can get to what's waiting on the other side of the door. POSEIDON. I guess the purge didn't get rid of all of the water. The purge left these machines behind. I could sneak by them, deal with the big one first. I've been made!

[She goes through a couple of alligator-like machines.]

Aloy: Okay. POSEIDON is through there. But where did that machine go?

[Suddenly Morlund and his friends appear!]

Morlund: Aloy - it's a miracle!

[They almost attracted a large dinosaur car. Aloy gives them a sign to be quiet.]

Aloy: (quietly) Come on, come on.

Morlund: Was this you? Did you lower the waters?

Aloy: Yeah, but there's a new problem. That thing's in our way.

[She points to the dinosaur machine.]

Morlund: Oh, wow… yeah, it's going to be difficult to get the Embers with that around.

Stemmur: "As the scrappy band of adventurers beheld the beast, they knew what they had to do…"

Abadund: What? Are you crazy?

Morlund: Hush now. She saved our delve.

Aloy: Okay, then. Stay up here and start firing when I engage.

[The dinosaur machine, the Tideripper, notices them, gets out of the water and roars. Aloy tries to sneak up to it. The fight begins!]

Morlund: Places, fellas! Get to that overhang!

Aloy: Machines weak against Frost. Down it goes!

Morlund: Aloy! Woo-hoo! You did it! Come on, gentlemen! Get a move on!

Aloy: You guys alright?

Morlund: More than alright, this-- You-- We did it! Ha! All the Embers we could ever want and it's all thanks to you.

Abadund: Very, um, heartwarming. but maybe we can just you know - Grab what we came here for and get out before any more of those things decide to show up?

Stemmur: Now now, shard-counter. Nothing wrong with a little reveling. Though we should probably let our flame-haired friend get going. I believe she has business down here, does she not?

Morlund: Right! Of course. You need any help?

Aloy: I can handle it from here.

Morlund: Very well. We'll start taking some of the Embers upstairs. Holler if you need us.

Aloy: Thanks

[Now Aloy news to find POSEIDON.]

Aloy: POSEIDON should be somewhere beyond this door. Time to bring it home.

Aloy: Okay, POSEIDON should be hiding in some kind of processor. I need to find a console to gain access to it. There. I should be able to use that console. 

[She’s ready to override.]

Aloy: I'm here to bring you home.

POSEIDON: TO GAIA. Yes. Mother. All waters lead back to her.

Aloy: Elisabet Sobeck. Alpha Prime.

Synthetic Voice: Master Override Activated. Restoring POSEIDON subordinate function to original code.

[Aloy picks up the capsule with the code.]

Aloy: Okay. Got to bring this back to GAIA.

Synthetic Voice: System reboot initiated.

Aloy: Huh. Looks like taking POSEIDON triggered a restart of the city's power system. Morlund and crew must have headed back up top. With all the Embers they could carry, I bet. 

[She enters a Chinese stylised casino.]

Aloy: An elevator. Morlund must've built this before the place flooded. Might still work. Be nice not to have to climb back up.

[She rises to the top with a makeshift elevator and hears Morlund and his friends enjoying the view.]

Morlund: Whatever she did, it must have powered up the whole city!

Stemmur: Is that… an eagle?

Abadund: How much did all this cost?

Morlund: The show my old gramps always wanted.

[They see flying Chinese dragons. Holographic of course.]

Abadund: There's another!

Stemmur: "His dream realized, his old gramps' legacy ensured, our hero beheld the sea of desert lights… and wept at his good fortune."

Morlund: When I saw the Embers as a child, I never dreamed they could be like this. Thank you, Aloy. Did you find what you were looking for?

Aloy: I did. And now I have to move on.

Morlund: Oh. Oh. Come back when you can. I've got big plans for this place.

Aloy: I thought you wanted to put on shows with the Embers back in the Claim?

Morlund: Oh, no. This is the show. Can you imagine? Folks from all over the land, coming to take it all in? Plus some food and a nice place to stay…

[He takes a leather flask from Stemmur and takes a sip.]

Stemmur: (rises the flask) Not to mention a variety of entertainment venues…

Abadund: Don't forget games of chance! Plenty of shards to be had there for certain. (laughs)

Aloy: A new dream, huh? I hope you make it happen. Goodbye, gentlemen.

[All three bow low.]

Morlund: This delve was a story for the ages, all thanks to you.

[Aloy walks away.]

Aloy: If Morlund and crew's going to stay, maybe I should come back and check on them later. For now, I need to get POSEIDON back to GAIA. But with all the ruins here, I might want to look around before I head back. And with my new Diving Mask, I can swim as deep as I need to. Like at those deep water sites I found earlier.

Morlund: We should build a place for kids, too. Where they can play, you know, parlor games.

Abadund: Like a carnival?

Morlund: Yeah. But we should make it sound extra big and extra fun.

Abadund: You mean call it something like… "Carnival Carnival"?

Morlund: Okay, just saying something twice doesn't make it sound better. Abadund.

[Aloy returns to the base.]

Erend: Anybody seen one of my Machine Strike pieces around?

Zo: Why don't you check the cache? Maybe you left it there when you dropped off all that ale.

Erend: Oh. Hope it didn't get stained.

[He notices Aloy.]

Erend: Hey, look who's back You find what you were looking for?

Aloy: I did. One step closer to taking the fight to the Zeniths.

Erend: Can't wait.

Aloy: You still sifting through loads of data?

Erend: Yeah. It's interesting. There's lots of… words. I thought maybe I could try finding things with more, you know, pictures in it. Not much luck there but I did find out about these holo films. Images, put together to tell a story. They were made to look like they were the real thing. The Oseram like shows. I'd bet they'd pay a lot of shards for those holos!

Aloy: How are things going around here?

Erend: You tell me. Varl's new girlfriend tried to kill me earlier.

Aloy: What did you do?

Erend: I made one joke-- About how they, you know, eat grass a lot. How does anyone fight with nothing but tree leaves in their stomach anyway?

Aloy: From the looks of it, the Utaru.

Erend: Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting her to be that fast.

Aloy: Just try not to get hurt. I see you've got Strike set up. Mind if I have a go at it?

Erend: Really? Sure! Let's do it. We can play another time if you want.

Aloy: I better get going.

Erend: Right. I'll be here if you need me.

[Aloy visits Zo.]

Zo: Aloy. You found another one of GAIA's sub-functions?

Aloy: Two down. One to go.

Zo: I'm glad her healing can continue.

Aloy: Found anything else combing through that data?

Zo: Varl and I have been looking into the animals of the Old World. Apparently there used to be thousands more species roaming around than there are today. Can you imagine that? I'd give anything to see them, even as holograms. Though I know that without ARTEMIS or APOLLO, that may prove difficult. At least I can find comfort in knowing GAIA used many of them as inspiration for her machines.

Aloy: Are you guys training with Erend, as well?

Zo: If you count trying to stick a spear in his gut as training, then yes.

Aloy: I've been told Please tell me you weren't being serious, though.

Zo: Of course not.

Aloy: Good.

Zo: I was going for a couple of broken bones. He called the Utaru leaf grazers. Laughed at the idea of us simple "farmers" being formidable fighters. Before I knew it, he and I were battling it out in the common room. The man is slow but he can throw a hammer around… Don't look so worried. We're evenly matched. For now. Next time, he's going down like a load of boar dump.

Aloy: Just try not to kill each other.

Zo: Injuring his pride should be good enough.

Aloy: I better get going.

Zo: Right. You've got that sub-function to deliver.

Aloy: Huh. Looks like Erend and Kotallo moved their stuff in.

Zo: Is your Focus acting up again?

Erend: It's fine.

Zo: I can take a look if you want.

Erend: Nah. Usually works if I just flick it a few times with my thumb.

[Aloy sinds a strange room…]

Aloy: GAIA, what was this room for?

GAIA: (via Focus) This was intended to be a recreational room for Control Center operatives. I have repurposed the displays to track Regalla's activity in the region.

Kotallo: A useful war map.

Aloy: Hey.

Kotallo: Aloy. I hope all is well enough under the circumstances.

Aloy: I'm holding up.

Kotallo: Good.

Aloy: You said you were training with the Focus?

Kotallo: That's right. I've been watching holograms of your first fight with the Zenith's Specters. They are faster and more agile than any machines I've faced before. How many do the Zeniths have?

Aloy: I'm not sure. Probably a lot.

Kotallo: I would not wish to face them en masse.

Aloy: I'm with you there. Must be strange seeing everything through a Focus now.

Kotallo: I can see machines like never before. Their strengths and weaknesses simply reveal themselves to me. To think that such a tiny object might be the most powerful weapon I've ever possessed.

Aloy: Getting AETHER out of the Grove made for quite a spectacle.

Kotallo: One that showed the entire tribe that Hekarro's mission for peace is the correct path. For it is now blessed by the Ten themselves.

Aloy: I heard my friend Talanah came by the base. Did you get a chance to meet her?

Kotallo: Briefly. A bold woman, going into Tenakth territory with that Carja armor of hers. She'll be lucky if my people don't shoot her on sight.

Aloy: She'll be careful. She's just looking for someone who might need her help.

Kotallo: Whoever it is they better be worth dying for.

Aloy: Have you had a chance to speak with Varl?

Kotallo: Briefly. He fought well against Regalla's troops at Barren Light. Are all Nora as skilled as the two of you?

Aloy: I'm not exactly one of them. But anyway… the Nora can hold their own. They managed to push the Carja from their lands.

Kotallo: I thought my tribe was the only one to have done that. Impressive.

Aloy: Does it still hurt?

Kotallo: It comes and goes. I try not to think about it. But its absence is always present for me… It's difficult to explain.

Aloy: I can't claim to understand. Only empathize.

Kotallo: Then you have my thanks.

Aloy: I should get going.

Kotallo: Back to my training, then.

[Aloy explores the base a little trying to find anything new.]

Aloy: Doors locked. Maybe GAIA will be able to get it open later. It was pretty weird talking to Beta - seeing someone who looks like me. Even though it seems like she doesn't act anything like me… or Elisabet, for that matter. Door won't open. Guess GAIA hasn't been able to restore access yet. It's locked. Well, I guess Beta wants her privacy for now. Wonder if Varl's in there with her.

[After that, she goes into GAIA’s room.]

GAIA: Welcome back, Aloy. I see you have recovered POSEIDON.

[Aloy inserts the capsule with POSEIDON’s source code into the console. “The Sea of Sands” mission completed!]

Varl: (via Focus) Aloy, can you come downstairs? Beta has something you need to hear.

Aloy: Okay. I’ll be right down.

GAIA: Aloy. I have managed to unlock additional rooms within the facility.

Aloy: Got it. Hey, GAIA. Me again.

GAIA: Welcome back, Aloy. Where shall we resume?

Aloy: How's Kotallo doing?

GAIA: I have detected that the loss of his arm still deeply pains him. In an effort to remedy this, I have discussed a potential solution with him. I believe he will want to fill you in on the details.

Aloy: A solution? I'll check in with him when I can then. How are things around here?

GAIA: Zo has been studying the morphology of her land-gods: in an effort to understand their "sickness." Without the abilities of HEPHAESTUS, I am unfortunately unable to correct their programming. However due to Zo’s perseverance we may have a workaround.

Aloy: Yeah, she filled me in. It sounds promising. Varl and Zo seem to like spending time together.

GAIA: Indeed. While studying Old World data. Zo discovered references to a dietary lifestyle known as “vegetarianism.” She appreciated the similarities with Utaru practices, and encouraged Varl to try out this lifestyle.

Aloy: And how did that go?

GAIA: I believe they have agreed to disagree.

Aloy: How's Erend handling things?

GAIA: He is becoming increasingly accustomed to use of the focus, after an initial incident.

Aloy: What did he do?

GAIA: He unfortunately crushed his first FOCUS as he attempted to affitto is temple. Amongst a number of Oseram curses, I believe he also blamed the focus for being "dainty." He has given repeated assurances that it will not happen again.

Aloy: Well, good thing we have a lot of extras, I guess. So, there's a few.people were now and they're learning... all about you, the ancient world. Almost like what was supposed to happen, before APOLLO was purged.

GAIA: Yes. While the loss of the APOLLO database was catastrophic, there is still much that can be gleaned from the data you have uncovered. For instance, Varl has been reviewing the last recorded during the Faro Plague. Hearing their hopes and fears made him quite somber.

Aloy: Anything I should be worried about?

GAIA: I do not believe so. I have elected not to intervene to allow him to process this on his own terms.

Aloy: So this facility, the Regional Control Center. It was meant to oversee the terraforming system?

GAIA: For the local region, yes. Had human received their education from the APOLLO database they would have then been guided here to assume operations. As that never happened, this place remained vacant.

Aloy: Until MINERVA decided to settle here. So I guess this room was meant to keep an eye on conditions de

GAIA: Yes. From here, the facility's operators would have been able to observe weather and machine activity in real-time.

Aloy: That would've been quite a sighe

GAIA: It may still be possible to view some of them, should you find and reconnect the cameras to this room's console.

Aloy: I'll keep a lookout. So the HADES Proving Lab where I found the GAIA kernel. It used to be a faro research facility?

GAIA: Yes. Prior to appropriation by Zero Dawn the facility was used to engineer and test advanced computer viruses. It appears to have been one of many research initiatives by Faro Automated Solutions.

Aloy: I guess it wasn't enough to build automated killing machines. He wanted viruses to infect them with, too. So a while back, before the battle at Meridian, I went into Banuk territory. I discovered another AI there, one not related to Zero Dawn. CYAN. It was created to oversee operations for a volcanic stabilization project, and had spent the last thousand years in isolation. I'm guessing you didn't know about it?

GAIA: No. From the data on your focus, it seems that CYAN was cut off from the outside world… An effort by its creators to protect it from the Faro Plague.

Aloy: Any chance it could help us now?

GAIA: I have already attempted contact, with no success. Given its previous experience with accepting an outside network request, I imagine is unwilling to do so again.

Aloy: Right. Because last time, HEPHAESTUS enslaved it. Well, that's too bad. I think the two of you would've had a lot to talk about. There was an ancient tank embedded in the Bulwark, buried under a bunch of boulders. Any idea how it got there?

GAIA: During the Faro Plague, the US military resumed the use of human combatants, as automated machinery was unreliable. It is possible the vehicle was part of a pre-automated war fleet.

Aloy: So they fought against the Faro machines in the valley… When I dove down into Vegas, I found data about the man who built the dome over the city - Stanley Chen. It turns out he was a member of Far Zenith. But if he loved Vegas so much, why did he abandon it? Why not try to save it?

GAIA: The Zeniths, at their core, have proven to be exceptional survivalists. Faced with overwhelming odds of extinction, they chose to flee.

Aloy: Even still... what he achieved - water to the wasteland, an entire city brought back to life… A thousand years later, the whole place was still on standby, just waiting for someone to come along and wake it up. When we were at the facility where we found Beta, there were records that said Far Zenith were researching embryogenesis. I know they traded their ectogenic chambers to Zero Dawn, but why were they researching it in the first place?

GAIA: Perhaps at one time they meant the Odyssey to be a colony ship, necessitating such technology. As their goals evolved over time, so did their areas of research.

Aloy: So they got more selfish as the risks of staying on Earth kept rising. GAIA... what was Elisabet like?

GAIA: Her presence is interwoven with my memories. The moment came online she was there. We exchanged greetings, names. Then set to our task. It was the first of many conversations. I enjoyed being in her company. Listening to her stories. She was my creator. My guide.

Aloy: Your friend.

GAIA: Yes. When I reviewed the data on your Focus, I was saddened to learn of her fate. Though I am glad she made it home, I deeply wish she did not have to be alone.

Aloy: She was okay with that. She gave all of herself. The only one who could. Thanks, GAIA. So Project Zero Dawn. The greatest minds in the world, all working to build the terraforming system while the Faro Plague devoured the planet. What was it like?

GAIA: Personnel worked in rotations at all hours of the day. Resources and technology were secured from across the world. Within a month of the project's conception was launched and began my education. Elisabet encouraged me to spend time with the rest of the Zero Dawn staff. She said it was important to experience many personalities and perspectives to aid in my emotional development.

Aloy: What were they like?

GAIA: Scared. Hopeful. Determined. They were hurtling toward technological achievements on a scale never before attempted. I owe everything to their dedication.

Aloy: Beta believes the Zeniths want to use the terraforming system to wipe out life on Earth. Start over so they can build it how they want.

GAIA: Further supporting our hypothesis.

Aloy: But why? Given their technology, they could wipe out the tribes of the world by easier means. And if they're the same people who left Earth a thousand years ago… wouldn't they want the biosphere to be as it was?

GAIA: It is likely they adjusted to different planetary conditions in their colony on Sirius. They may be trying to recreate that environment here.

Aloy: Turning Earth into a new Sirius… their own personal playground. So, the Zenith are the same people who left Earth. Physically immortal. How'd they figure it out?

GAIA: From what we know of Far Zenith, it is plausible that prominent geneticists and engineers were offered a place aboard the Odyssey in exchange for their expertise. Given enough time, technology, and resources any challenge can be overcome.

Aloy: Like how MINERVA eventually generated the deactivation codes for the Faro Plague.

GAIA: Exactly.

Aloy: The Zenith - Gerard, Erik, Tilda, Verbena. Beta said they were some of the most powerful people on Earth. Do you know anything about them?

GAIA: Unfortunately, no. My personnel database is limited to those who worked on Zero Dawn. Additionally, it appears Far Zenith was… quite secretive about their members. Only one, Osvald Dalgaard, was ever publicly known.

Aloy: Right… he was the spokesperson back at their old launch facility

GAIA: What we can conclude, from your and Beta's experiences, is that the Zeniths are ruthless in pursuit of their goal. To protect life on Earth they must be stopped.

Aloy: The Extinction Signal didn't just wake HADES. It made every subordinate function self-aware. Why?

GAIA: I have wondered this myself. So far as I can tell. HADES was the sole target and the partial sentience imparted to other subordinate functions was incidental…

Aloy: A signal that precise would require thorough knowledge of the system. How could the Zeniths know that?

GAIA: From the records on your Focus, it appears Far Zenith had an informant during the development of Zero Dawn.

Aloy: Hank Shaw. He was supposed to steal a copy of the system for Far Zenith, but Elisabet and Travis Tate caught him first.

GAIA: Yes. It is likely Far Zenith acquired knowledge on the systems design though him despite his failure.

Aloy: So, from what Beta told me… I guess we can assume the Zeniths' technology is powerful in all sorts of ways, right?

GAIA: Yes. As your encounters with them amply demonstrate, they appear to make extensive use of robotic servitors. Further, they seem to be equipped with some kind of protective energy field that shields them from harm.

Aloy: They seemed indestructible, but that weapon the rebels used stripped their shield, somehow.

GAIA: Throughout history every defensive technology has eventually been defeated by an offensive counterpart. While we lack the anti-shielding weapon, were I to absorb HEPHAESTUS and utilize it to create a large force of combat machines… no shielding could withstand such an assault indefinitely.

Aloy: So here's hope.

GAIA: Always.

Aloy: What can you tell me about DEMETER?

GAIA: DEMETER sows, fertilizes, and tends to plant life.

Aloy: So once I bring it back all the light out there will start to get better?

GAIA: While permanent restoration requires the abilities of HEPHAESTUS, I may be able to improve conditions in the region for a while. However a word of warning. Like AETHER and POSEIDON, DEMETER’s response to my query was highly irregular. Alone and frightened it may have taken measures assure is security.

Aloy: Okay. I'll keep my guard up. The missing subordinate functions. What can you tell me about them?

GAIA: ARTEMIS re-wilded the Earth with a variety of animal species. ELEUTHIA was responsible for gestating, nurturing, and acculturating a new generation of human beings. APOLLO was tasked with preserving, organizing, and disseminating vast archives of human knowledge and cultural achievements. Unfortunately, all archived APOLLO data was purged on the 2nd of February 2015 by order of Ted Faro.

Aloy: Faro, huh? I really hate that guy.

GAIA: Understandable. He appears to have been pathologically narcissistic, impulsive, and unstable.

Aloy: All three of the missing functions have already served their purpose - or were prevented from doing so. Do you still need them?

GAIA: Restoring their remaining elements would increase my heuristic processing density empowering my overall funcion. Unfortunately, as we now know they are in the possession of Far Zenith, attaining them in the short-term is very likely impossible.

Aloy: I guess our best shot at recovering them is by taking over the Zenith base. But we'll need HEPHAESTUS and a bunch of combat machines to do that.

GAIA: Correct.

Aloy: Were you able to make use of POSEIDON?

GAIA: Yes. Many rivers, streams, and lakes associated with the regional watershed have been detoxified. As a result, red algae growth levels have seen a marked decline. According to my data, however, it appears a localized occurrence of red algae continues to persist near the coast.

Aloy: Maybe I'll look into it when I can. So, POSEIDON spent the last wenty years hiding out in Las Vegas. From the data found, it seems the city had an advanced water reclamation system. Is that why POSEIDON went there?

GAIA: Most likely. In an effort to protect itself, POSEIDON sought out a safe harbor where it could access water supply functions. There, buried and encased in a protective dome, it could guard against any threats.

Aloy: Like three Oseram showmen.

GAIA: I suspect that was not the first time it felt the need to repel trespassers.

Aloy: So once HEPHAESTUS has been recovered and merged, you'll regain the capacity to mass produce machines at Cauldrons around the world?

GAIA: Yes, and to program the behavioral routines. Or even control them directly.

Aloy: So, you could build an army of machines? Attack the Zeniths and take them out.

GAIA: It is in my nature to take any and all necessary steps to preserve life on Earth, human life above all. So yes, once have been empowered with the capacities of HEPHAESTUS, I could design, build and command such an army. Given the nature of the Far Zenith threat, doing so may be our only option. I must admit, however, that I have misgivings about using such technology to kill, no matter how aggressive the enemy.

Aloy: That's good. It means you have a conscience - as Elisabet intended.

GAIA: Indeed.

Aloy: You mentioned that the super storms have subsided. Is that AETHER at work?

GAIA: Yes. Thanks to AETHER's capabilities, weather patterns in the local region should mostly stabilize for the time being.

Aloy: That'll be a relief for the Terakth. One of their villages is still recovering after a mudslide caused the whole place to flood.

GAIA: I will continue to stabilize the atmosphere for as long as I can.

Aloy: Why did AETHER take up residence in an ancient war museum?

GAIA: As with the other subordinate functions, AETHER needed to install itself on a processor with adequate storage and power. The one in the museum appears to have been sufficient, given that the holographic displays were still active.

Aloy: So AETHER was assured it could stay fonas long as it needed to.

GAIA: Correct. Though it is curious that it chose a place surrounded with the ancient ruins of aircraft.

Aloy: Maybe it also felt at home there. I should be going.

GAIA: Goodbye, Aloy.

[Aloy leaves GAIA's room and walks out into Varla. Next to him on the floor, Beta reads and watches the holographic tape that Aloy found the first time she entered the ancient ruins as a girl.]

Unknown Man: Hi! Happy Birthday, Isaac! Daddy sure does love his little big man!

Varl: She found that recording from the data on your Focus. She's been watching it a lot. I think it helps calm her.

Aloy: You know, I used to watch this a lot, too. Whenever I wanted to take my mind off things. But there's something you need to tell me?

Varl: While you were gone, I came down here to check on her. Then we started talking... right, Beta? She's been thinking about how to capture HEPHAESTUS, studying the data GAIA gave her. But we started talking about some other stuff. You know, just getting to know each other, right? And then she told me that one of the Zeniths might be different from the others.

Beta: Tilda. You saw her, at the HADES Proving Lab.

Varl: Go on.

Beta: On the way to Earth, the Zeniths never showed their faces. My servitor caretaker referred to them as my "benefactors..." ...and promised I'd meet them someday when I had learned enough.

Aloy: And then?

Beta: One day, a data channel opened in my training interface. In it, Tilda was waiting for me, in a virtual replica of a house on a cliff, overlooking the ocean. It was beautiful. She showed me paintings, books, media files. We met there, in secret, many times. But a few months later, it stopped.

Varl: Can you tell us why, Beta?

Aloy: I found some data about Tilda at the HADES Proving Lab. I think she was the liaison between Far Zenith and Zero Dawn. She knew Elisabet Sobeck, that's for sure.

Varl: Maybe that's why she reached out to you?

Aloy: What else can you tell us about Tilda?

Beta: She... Liked to talk about her paintings.

Aloy: What about herself? Did she ever talk about her life on Earth, how she joined the Zeniths, something like that?

Beta: She never said much about herself. And she hated it when I asked too many questions. But I think, back on Earth she was an expert programmer, given that she built a data channel the other Zeniths couldn't detect.

Aloy: Is there anything else about her that we might be able to use to our advantage?

Beta: She was the first real person who ever bothered to speak to me. I wasn't really assessing her for strengths and weaknesses.

Aloy: You said that Tilda reached out to you using a "data channel"?

Beta: It appeared in my training interface as another assignment. When I opened it, there were a series of intermittent glitches. I realized they formed a transpositional cipher… Instructions on how to open up a new virtual space. When I entered it, my training interface disappeared. Instead of the usual holographic teachers and files, I was in a perfect recreation of her home.

Aloy: And you're sure that the other Zeniths never knew about it?

Beta: To them, it looked like I was still in training, toiling away, alone.

Aloy: So this secret virtual space looked like a house with an ocean view?

Beta: I could see white caps and hear waves crashing on rocks below. And there were gulls crying outside. Inside, Tilda had frames that showed off her favorite paintings, changing at intervals to match the light. There was an armchair she liked. She'd sit there and gaze outside while I looked through her things. We spent hours in that house. I never wanted to leave.

Aloy: You said Tilda showed you paintings and let you access media files?

Beta: Every time we met, she showed me a new painting. I think she was Dutch. All of her favorite pieces were from their heyday in the 1600s. Portraits, allegories, ships at sea. She had so many.

Aloy: They didn't interest you?

Beta: I liked her media portal. It had so much more than my training interface. Clips, shows, holos. My favorite was this one called Second Time Around, about a family whose kid comes back after disappearing during the Hot Zone Crisis--

Aloy: Right. But did this portal have anything about the Zeniths themselves? Anything we could use?

Beta: No. Any information about them was redacted.

Aloy: So Tilda set up a secret virtual space where she could talk to you - a house on a cliff. Then, later, she cut you off… But other than the fact that Tilda knew Elisabet… you don't know why she did those things?

Beta: (annoyed) I don't! Okay? I thought of every possible reason that would make her leave, but whatever I did wrong. I don't know what it is! When I finally met the others, she ignored me. Acted like the data channel never existed. None of this even matters! Tilda's the same as the others. It won't help us defeat them!

Aloy: Okay. Let's leave it at that, then.

Varl: What's wrong?

Aloy: I'm trying, Varl, but she is tough to take. I'm out there in the wilds, risking my life every day. And all she can do is hide in there and tell us how hopeless it all is. I'm sorry she's had a rough time, but she is really not helping right now.

Varl: Hmm. You always seem to be on top of everything, so I sometimes forget about what you've been through. I mean, it wasn't that long ago you were so banged up you couldn't even walk. About that when I pulled you out of the water back near the Proving Lab, you were muttering Rost's name. You never talk about him. But he raised you, trained you. You must miss him a lot.

Aloy: Of course I do. But I don't have time to think about that now. I need to get back out there.

Varl: Okay. I'll keep working with Beta. GAIA says she knows a lot about Zero Dawn. Maybe she just needs some time to adjust, and then she can help us with HEPHAESTUS.

Aloy: Sure. But I won't hold my breath.

Varl: The Old Ones used holograms for everything.

Zo: It let them experience a great many things.

Varl: Holograms are illusions, though. I wonder if at some point... they just couldn't tell what was real anymore.

Zo: Maybe. They were intelligent But that doesn't mean they were wise.

Aloy: Hey. Got a sec?

Varl: Of course.

Aloy: How's training?

Varl: Discovering something new about our past every day. When we first met, you asked me if I ever wondered what this world looked like when the Old Ones lived here. I thought it was strange at the time. But a lot has changed since I left the Embrace. Now I'm just trying to make sense of everything I thought I knew and, versus everything I know now.

Aloy: The change is hard. But it gets easier over time. It's hard to believe we're dealing with the original Zeniths. The same ones that left for Sirius a thousand years ago.

Varl: To live on for so long… it doesn't seem natural.

Aloy: Because it's not.

Varl: That weapon we found where Beta was hiding. Any chance we can use that against them?

Aloy: Sylens made sure that wasn't an option.

Varl: Why would he build something to hurt Far Zenith, yet allow them to capture you?

Aloy: With Sylens there's always an angle. We just don't know what it is yet. What do you make of this "Tilda" that Beta was talking about?

Varl: Well, the way she described it, I can't shake off the feeling that Tilda wanted something from Beta. Maybe because she's Elisabet Sobecks clone? But whatever she wanted, I don't think she got it. If we knew what it was, maybe we could use it to our advantage somehow.

Aloy: I don't know. I don't think Tilda and Elisabet were on the best of terms.

Varl: Oh, well. At least we can take some comfort in knowing the Zeniths don't trust each other.

Aloy: Maybe. You feeling okay?

Vart: I was just thinking about Beta and all that time spent with the Zeniths. To think someone would… "make" a person just to lock them in a room to use when needed, like some sort of tool. Elisabet Sobeck sacrificed herself for the world and yet they have no trouble treating Beta like a slave.

Aloy: Another reason we have to stop them. You brought up Rost before. I do think about him, you know. He was all I had. And he brought me up the best he could. Not only that… When HADES discovered who I was and sent the Eclipse after me, he sacrificed himself so I could survive. But that seems like ages ago. So much has happened since. What I'm doing now... I don't think he could even begin to understand it. The Sacred Lands were all he really knew. So I can’t let myself dwell on him. Not with everything I have to do.

Varl: I understand. Sometimes when I think about my sister… about what she would have become if she had survived the Proving… It hurts. And I just need to bury it for a while. But only for a while, Aloy. You can't ignore it forever. Memories always come back. The ones that matter, anyway.

Aloy: I know. But for now the mission has to come first.

Varl: Fair enough.

Aloy: I should get back out there.

Varl: We'll be here if you need us.

[Leaving Varl, Aloy goes to his friend, Zo.]

Zo: Aloy.

Aloy: Hey. How's everything going?

Zo: I am well. But… Varl told me Beta's having a hard time adjusting to life here with us. I wish there was something I could do to helpю

Aloy: I'm not sure any of us canю

Zo: A tree won't bear fruit in a day. We'll do our best to make her feel welcomeю

Aloy: What are you going to learn next?

Zo: I'm not sure. I asked GAIA for suggestions and she brought up data you found on something called a "museum"? From what I gather, the Old Ones would store knowledge in them for all to see and learn from. Like you've done here for us. Maybe one day more people will be able to use this place to learn the way we have.

Aloy: That sounds... crowded. But nice. The Zeniths did a number on Beta, but she seems to trust Varl.

Zo: I still can't believe she told him the Zeniths are... immortals. Old Ones who cut themselves off from the cycle of life and decay.  I've never heard of anything so selfish. To deny our dying bodies to the earth, to doom the life that would bloom in their place… It's despicable.

Aloy: Is there anything I can help with around here?

Zo: Hmm? Oh, no, we're doing fine.

Aloy: Are you okay?

Zo: You and Varl have been friends for a while.

Aloy: I like to think so.

Zo: I was wondering, what do you know about his mother?

Aloy: Oh.

Zo: That bad, huh?

Aloy: Why do you want to know?

Zo: He's spoken of his sister, Vala. But noticed he avoids talking about his mother.

Aloy: She's the War-Chief of the Nora. Best warrior the tribe's ever known. Tougher than a Thunderjaw. But she could be pretty harsh at times.

Zo: I see. That must've been hard on him… Thank you for telling me. I feel silly not being able to ask Varl directly.

Aloy: I wouldn't worry about it. He's probably afraid Sona will scare you off someday.

Zo: I'd like to see her try.

Aloy: Tshould get going

Zo: Good luck on your search.

[Aloy finds Erend.]

Erend: Aloy. Everything all right? It seemed like you and Varl were down in that basement for a while.

Aloy: Yeah, everything's fine, I guess.

Erend: Well, okay. What can I do for you?

Aloy: Seems like you're getting a hang of this data thing.

Erend: It's been helpful. When I can make sense of anything. I did find the Old Ones enjoyed a good brew like the rest of us. Only they let machines serve the stuff. In bars! Even let the damn things cut you off before you saw the underside of a table. And that's half the fun! You won't see me letting a "robot" serve me a pitcher anytime soon.

Aloy: I see someone's been playing Strike,

Erend: I'm just trying to get some practice in. Helps take my mind off things.

Aloy: You should try playing Kotallo. It's a Tenakth game. Maybe you'll learn something.

Erend: Sure. Tenakth. Are you sure he won't try to kill me if I win?

Aloy: Pretty sure. Do I smell.. ale?

Erend: I brought some over from Chainscrape. With everything that’s been going on,I thought we could all use a drink. Besides, there's nothing that brings people together like a good brew. That's what my sister always said, anyways. You're more than welcome to have some.

Aloy: Maybe another time. I should get going.

Erend: Back to reading, I guess. You be careful out there.

Aloy: (to herself) Beta's been... difficult to figure out. She's just so closed off. I get that the Zeniths were cruel to her. That the one called Tilda abandoned her. But I can't get her out of her shell. I don't know. Maybe nothing can. I know Varl meant well, bringing up Rost. I just... I guess it's hard to talk about. With everything going on, it feels easier to set those memories aside. At least for now. Looks like GAIA was able to unlock that door. There's a lot of equipment in here. GAIA, what was all this for?

GAIA: (via Focus) This room was designed for management of the facility's vast seed banks. From here, Control Center operatives would have monitored new crop rotations into the automated farmlands now known as Plainsong.

Aloy: I see. According to this console, there are still thousands of plant samples stored deep below the facility. I could ask GAIA about them the next time I talk to her.

[She visits Kotallo.]

Aloy: Mind if we have a word?

Kotallo: Of course not.

Aloy: What do you think of this place? It must take some getting used to. 

Kotallo: It's an efficient center of operations and an acceptable training facility. Though it could use some more… color.

Aloy: Duly noted. Have you spoken with Erend at all?

Kotallo: I've had little chance to. I did see him bring some ale from out east.

Aloy: That stuffs as bitter as Salvebrush.

Kotallo: You get used to it eventually. In fact, I wouldn't mind a drink myself.

Aloy: I'm sure Erend wouldn't mind sharing. I should get going.

Kotallo: If I can help in some way, say the word.

Aloy: I will. Thank you.

[She returns to the wilds.]

SEEDS OF THE PAST
[Aloy rides Bristleback down a narrow mountain trail. After dismounting, she jumps off the mountain using her glider.]

Aloy: The coordinates that GAIA gave me for DEMETER are close.

[As she lands, she runs toward an ancient, dilapidated building from which a fiery arrow flies straight at her. Aloy barely dodges it.]

Aloy: Damn!

[She tries to reason with the defenders.]

Aloy: Hold your fire! I'm not here to fight!

Quen Guard: The barbarians pinned down! Move in!

Aloy: Okay. Whoever these people are, it looks like we're not going to be friends. I need to get past these hostiles and into the ruins.

[She takes off her bow and begins to defend herself.]

Quen Marine: Take her out! Now!

Cuen Marine: For the Ancestors!

Quen Marine: Protect the site! Kill her!

Quen Marine: Put her down!

Quen Marine: Not one more step, barbarian!

[Aloy defeats the defenders.]

Aloy: Who are these people? And why are they out for blood? I better get to DEMETER fast in case there's more of them. According to GAIA, it should be somewhere in these ruins.

[She explores the ruins for a while.]

Aloy: Looks like some sort of old office complex.

Synthetic Voice: The Greenhouse: Faro Automated Solution's industry-leading biotech research facility Agritech. Environmental remediation. Organic waste management. Whatever your company needs, here at the Greenhouse, we'll help solve your problems… naturally.

Aloy: A Faro research facility. 

[She finds a closed door with a bud-like panel near it.]

Aloy: A Metal Flower. DEMETER should be right beyond that door. But those vines are blocking the way. Unless I can cut through them, I'm gonna need to find another way in. 

[She explores some more.]

Aloy: A room with no way out. Great. At least there's a console. Hmm. A log.

[She plays the holographic recording. An aged Asian woman appears.]

Aquino: (record) Just got off the line with Us Robot Command. Time's running out. Didn't have the heart to tell Herres that our "cure" might be worse than the disease. Even if Adamantine Wreath works, we still have to prove we can curtail the trailing plants efficiently. But Kavels team is working on it over at Test Station Ivy. He'll come through. He has to.

Aloy: "Adamantine Wreath." Another secret project. Well, they made the Metal Flowers here and the vines. So… maybe I can find a way to destroy them. If I can find "Test Station Ivy." Now, how do I get out of here? 

[She uses the holographic interface to open the shutters.]

Aloy: There we go… Great. These guys again. Whoever they are, they want me dead. I better be careful.

[She jumps down to the grass.]

Aloy: Okay. I could take those soldiers out quietly.

Quen Marine: There's a barbarian in the compound. She got past the lookouts. Find her. Kill her… And bring herhead to the Lieutenant.

Quen Marine: Understood.

Aloy: I guess diplomacy's off the table.

[She quietly walks through the grass killing Quen soldiers.]

Quen Marine: Protect the site! Kill her.

Quen Imperial Guard: Take her out! Now!

Aloy: I really wish these people would have talked to me instead of trying to kill me. Now I need to find a way out of this courtyard. That door looks promising. 

[She enters the ancient facility with her bow at the ready. She notices someone behind some boxes… It's a young woman.]

Alva: I submit. Do as you will.

Aloy: I didn't want to fight your friends out there. They attacked me.

Alva: If by death alone I can atone our trespass…

Aloy: I'm not gonna kill you, okay? I just want to figure out what's going on. Where did you get that Focus?

Alva: I am of the chosen people, the Quen. The Ancestors left the power of the focus to us alone - the eye that reveals the Legacy.

Aloy: The "Legacy" huh?

Alva: The Legacy. The truth. It is in the darkness and the lost places, among the ancient ashes and the bones of the before, that it lies waiting. As a Diviner, it is my task to seek it out… for the good of my people.

Aloy: You're looking for data. Maybe we can help each other. What's your name?

Alva: Alva. Second Diviner of the Eastern Expedition.

Aloy: I'm Aloy. Why don't we start again. I've never heard of the Quen. 

Alva: Our lands lie across the Great Ocean. We haven't been here before.

Aloy: So why come now?

Alva: Our homeland has been ravaged by freakish weather - terrible storms and blistering droughts. The crops are failing. The people are starving. When we looked for answers, it was proposed that if we had the courage to cross the ocean to Legacy's Landfall… then we might earn the knowledge we need to save our people. But so far, that knowledge has eluded us.

Aloy: So, your people call this place "Legacy's Landfall"?

Alva: No. Landfall is where we arrived. To the west, in the shadows of the Sunken City, by the broken bridge.

Aloy: You mean San Francisco?

Alva: Yes. You're well-versed in the Legacy. It was a place of great importance to our Ancestors. We had hoped to learn their secrets there, but so far that door remains closed. Even so, the data we discovered there has led us to this place. It might be our last chance.

Aloy: To find something that can save your crops and your people?

Alva: Yes. If the Ancestors will be generous to us once more.

Aloy: So you said your "Ancestors" left your tribe that Focus?

Alva: Yes. Thirteen Diviners have possessed this one since it was discovered among the ruins in our homeland.

Aloy: So, you have one. But none of the soldiers out there did.

Alva: We each have our role to play. No, it is the Diviners purpose to seek out the Legacy. Interpret the wisdom of our Ancestors for the good of all. And to keep it safe. Not even the Imperial family And certainly not soldiers.

Aloy: So, how many Diviners are there?

Alva: At Landfall, a small group. Back at home, a few dozen more. That's a guess. Only the Overseers know for sure, and I am not of their rank.

Aloy: So, you call data from the ancient past the "Legacy"?

Alva: Yes - all that is not Lost, or Forbidden.

Aloy: What does that mean?

Alva: All that we are capable of reading, and that which is permitted.

Aloy: Okay… Not sure I get it, that's fine. So what do you use the data for?

Alva: The greatest secrets are the ones that improve the lives of many. How to tend our crops, how to hold flood waters back, or even cross the ocean.

Aloy: Technology.

Alva: That is what I seek here. Technology that can help my people back home.

Aloy: Those soldiers, they opened fire on me without warning. Why?

Alva: It is the duty of the Quen to seek out the Legacy… and defend it from the ignorant and envious. Not that you seem ignorant. But back home, other tribes only mean us harm. And we were told the same was true here.

Aloy: Does that come from your "Legacy"?

Alva: The Legacy is truth. But, we have been known to misinterpret it. I hope time and the wisdom of our Ancestors will guide us down the correct path.

Aloy: Yeah. I hope so, too. I'm looking for a place in this facility called "Test Station Ivy." Have you found any data that mentions it?

Alva: No. But I did find something like looks like a map. But it was unreadable - Lost.

Aloy: Maybe I can make some sense of it?

Alva: There.

Aloy: There's a lot of files here.

Alva: I've been through all of them. Look in the "gh/facility" section. Like I said. A Lost file.

Aloy: You can't see the map?

[Aloy scans Alva’s Focus.]

Aloy: It's okay. Looks like your Focus is an early model… the operating system won't be able to read any files created after the mid-2050s. But I could share them with you. 

Alva: Share them? 

[Aloy projects the map on the table.]

Alva: You can see what is Lost… and Forbidden.

Aloy: Not lost. Not forbidden. Just a newer format. There. That's where I need to go.

Alva: But you can't get there. We've been here for a week, trying to get deeper into the complex. The way has been blocked by rubble.

Aloy: What about the tunnel? It looks like it unlocks from here.

Alva: No. I thought these might be some kind of access controls, but I couldn't read enough data to make them work

Aloy: Well let's try it with my Focus, okay?

[They start exploring the facility.]

Alva: I believe these consoles were meant to be operated in unison, but I'm not sure.

Aloy: Okay. Here we go.

Alva: Following your lead. The Ancestors have shown us the way.

Aloy: Come on - Let's go.

Alva: You want me to come with you?

Aloy: It took both of us to open up that tunnel, didn't it?

Alva: This place is a maze.

Aloy: According to the map, there should be another exit further in. Just stay close.

Alva: Lead the way. I can't believe you actually got us in. I was dreading having to stay here any longer with those soldiers. The way they slaughtered the barbarians that approached the site… it was like they enjoyed it. Most of my people aren't like that. I promise.

Aloy: Firegleam. Better stand back.

Alva: Okay. Well, that was loud. There has to be a way out of here. What's that thing in the wall?

Aloy: Through here.

Alva: A dead end. Maybe we should try another path. We haven't tried that smaller tunnel over there.

Aloy: According to the map, the exit should be this way.

Alva: I'll be glad to get back above ground.

Aloy: Yeah. It feels like a tomb down here. 

[They find a way out of the tunnels and see a pterodactyl-like machine.]

Aloy: That can't be good.

Alva: They fly to and from the complex several times a day. Only the Ancestors know why.

Aloy: The Ancestors are dead, Alva.

Alva: Of course. How else could they be “ancestors”?

Aloy: Looks like we have more pressing concerns. Follow my lead. Send this to my stash. Won't get much use out of Shock ammo. Machines.

Alva: We can fight them. Or try to sneak past. Your call.

[Aloy tries to sneak past the machines.]

Aloy: I'm just a blade of grass… A very red blade of grass.

[She blows her cover.]

Aloy: Now!

[Together they defeat the herd.]

Alva: I've never seen anyone fight machines like you do.

Aloy: I've had a lot of practice. Now, we can find a way back into the facility. Find this in my stash later. A vent. I think I can pull it open. Got it.

Alva: I'm right behind you. Maybe we can get through that hatch on the ground. It looks like the one we used at the first station. There's consoles up here, too!

Aloy: But no way to get to them. You stay put. I'll see what I can find. Locked. I think I can move these things. I don't think I can jump up there. I'll have to find another way. Those rails on the floor lead into the walls. I guess that's one way to make an exit.

Alva: Um, Aloy, would… would you mind warning me next time you decide to, uh, blow up a wall?

Aloy: I'll try. Is there some kind of storage in the walls? There we go. Huh. There's some space back there. Ah ha. This should help. Supplies. This one won't budge. Maybe one of the others? There we go.

[She opens a hatch and pulls out some kind of a device out of it.]

Alva: That looks like some sort of conveyor rig… You think you can move it over to me? 

Aloy: Yeah. If you can hop on top of it, I can get you to those consoles. 

Alva: Exactly! Hold it there! Let me just-- I jumped on top!

Aloy: Hold on.

Alva: That's good. Jumping over. Made it! I'm at the console. Wait… there's data here. A lot. But it's blocked. Something's restricting access. If I can't get past it, my mission here is doomed.

Aloy: Alva, I'll help if I can, okay? But first we have to get out of here.

Alva: Right. We need to open the hatch. Let's see, Okay. I'm unlocking a storage unit. There should be a power cell inside. Then you need to find a way into the generator room.

Aloy: Okay. I'm on it.

Alva: Okay. That brought power back to the doors. You can reach me now.

Aloy: On my way.

Alva: Okay. We need to operate both consoles simultaneously to open the hatch.

Aloy: I'll get to the other console. You stay here.

Alva: Ready when you are!

Aloy: Okay, are you ready? On two. One. Two.

Synthetic Voice: Commencing Adamantine Wreath vulnerability test scenario 12-C15.

[The device is placed in the center of the room and plugged it. Shutter on the large and tall windows slides open.]

Aloy: Okay. That's where we need to go.

Synthetic Voice: Magnetic field engaged. Initiating biomass conversion process.

Aloy: What? No, no, no, no, no!

[The system begin to eat up all the organic life in reach.]

Aloy: How do I shut this thing off?

Synthetic Voice: Failsafe exceeded. Test cannot be aborted.

Alva: What is this…?

Aloy: It's how the world ended.

[Suddenly the system stops.]

Synthetic Voice: Test complete. Adamantine Wreath structural integrity… uncompromised.

Alva: What did we just see?

Aloy: Alva. Let's meet below. I'm gonna share a file with you, okay?

[She plays Aquino’s hologram she found not so long ago.]

Aquino: Test log Elm. I think it's Tuesday… the second? Aw, who cares. I'll say this for the end of the world - it's jam-packed with irony. We developed biomass conversion here. Infinite food for infinite machines. And now we're racing against time to find something to give them indigestion. Well, it works. War machines won't be able to eat the wreaths. But can we deploy them in time? God. I hope so.

Alva: I don't understand…

Aloy: Your “Ancestors.” They were wiped out. Your “Legacy” didn't tell you that?

Alva: The time of ashes. But most of the data about that is Lost. Or Forbidden.

Aloy: Well, they created machines that consumed all life. You just saw how. It's a miracle that anything survived.

Alva: I don't want to know this! This is not why I'm here. I need the wisdom of my Ancestors to help save my people! Not Forbidden knowledge of their sins! I need to find something that helps, something to bring back. The Overseers will punish me. Or even worse, people will die. Do you understand? My family. My sister. I left her when she was fourteen. Already you could see her bones. They will starve. (getting emotional)

Aloy: Alva… Alva. I get it. I do. It's hard to explain, but you and I are working toward the same goal. And if I succeed, your people won't need any data. Things will just… they will get better. 

Alva: But even if I believe you, my people won't. I need to bring something back. 

Aloy: Okay. Then we'll go to Test Station Ivy and if I can find a way to kill those vines, then I'll have access to the Data Core. What I need is in there. I'm pretty sure that if I take it, it'll unblock access to all the data that this place has. And that will give you something to bring home.

Alva: I'm not sure I understand. But, every secret makes its own maze. A Diviner must persevere. Go on. I'll follow.

[They enter The Tunnels.]

Alva: Another maze. But the road to truth is never a straight line. So, the Metal Flowers… what the data referred to as "Adamantine Wreaths…" They were supposed to stop the destruction that caused the time of ashes?

Aloy: Looks like it. But I guess something went wrong

Alva: So, I never asked… are you from around here?

Aloy: No, I'm not… spent most of my life in a place far to the east.

Alva: We've both traveled a long way, then.

Aloy: This is it. Okay. Let's find a way to get into the Proving Ground. That complex should be Test Station Ivy.

Alva: Let's hope it holds the answers we seek.

[A Dreadwing attacks them.]

Alva: It can turn invisible??

Aloy: We're gonna have to take it out to get into the Test Station. You with me?

Alva: Yes. 

[Together they defeat the Dreadwing.]

Alva: That was amazing! Terrifying. But amazing.

Aloy: Well, you helped. We should be able to get into Test Station Ivy now. (examining Dreadwing) It's carrying one of the Metal Flowers. Is that how they've been distributed? Air-dropped from these machines?

Alva: We shouldn't linger here. There might be more machines.

[They enter the Greenhouse.]

Aloy: There has to be some data here on the Adamantine Wreath we can use.

Alva: I trust your Focus will see what mine cannot. Oh. That's interesting.

Aloy: Find something?

Alva: The fourth Test Station… Willow. It looks like it's underwater.

Aloy: Hmm. Might be worth a look sometime.

Alva: I must have faith. I walk with the Ancestors. We shall find what we seek.

Aloy: This console's still operational. Another log.

Aquino: (record) We're done. In every way. The wreaths work. And Kavel came through on a way to destroy them. Downloading a coded key into the deployment shell triggers an enzyme that causes the wreaths to eat themselves from within. But it's too late. The latest projections from US Robot Command have swarm reproduction outpacing our ability to drop the shells by 375%. Not even close. I… I guess we deserve this. I deserve it. For what I made here. This will be my last log before evacuation.

Alva: So, all their efforts were in vain. They ran out time.

Aloy: At least we have the software module they created. It should get rid of the vines produced by the Metal Flowers. I need a workbench to load the module onto my spear.

Alva: There's one back at our camp. The map showed a path leading back there past the next room.

Aloy: I can't leave here until I find what I need.

[She prise open a door.]

Aloy: In here. We'll have to climb up.

Alva: Right behind you.

Aloy: We can use the line to get down.

Alva: Uh…right. Easy. Uh… Made it! But we'd better make haste. After we encountered barbarians, our Lieutenant called for reinforcements. They could be here any time.

Aloy: Right.

[She uses the workbench and makes a Vine Cutter as well as some upgrades for her bow.]

Alva: Now what?

Aloy: Now we get to that Data Core. Let's hope this new module works. 

[She attacks the Flower with her spear and it splits open.]

Aloy: The flower's blooming. Let's see if this software works.

[She inserts her spear into the Metal Flower’s socket.]

Alva: The vines. They're falling apart.

Aloy: Door's clear now.

Alva: The Data Core Looks intact.

Aloy: Time to bring DEMETER home.

[She approaches the console.]

Aloy: DEMETER, it's time to go home. To GAIA.

DEMETER: The seed of life. Yes.

[She overrides DEMETER.]

Aloy: Elisabet Sobeck. Alpha Prime.

Synthetic Voice: Master Override Activated. Restoring DEMETER subordinate function to original code.

Alva: What did you do? I've never seen my Focus glitch like that.

Aloy: I found a special type of data. Something you can't read. But, it kept a tight grip on the Data Core. But now you should have access the central server. All of it. That should give you something to bring home.

Alva: You were right. Hundreds of archives Almost all of it relating to agriculture. It would take us years to get through all of this. But we don't have that kind of time. What you said before, about wor--

[At that moment an arrow flies past them, nearly killing Alva. They are attacked by several heavily armored Quen soldiers with bows.]

Aloy: Alva!

Alva: Hold your fire! By the word of the Ancestors, you must stop! Come. Look at who you've fired on!

Quen Marine: That barbarian killed our soldiers!

Alva: Only those who fired blindly. She is no barbarian. She gave me the data we need. Come, look at her.

[Aloy slowly gets out of her hiding.]

Alva: Can't you see? Elisabet Sobeck stands before you! An Ancestor reborn!

[Quen soldiers lower their bows and bowing!]

Quen Marine: Diviner. We should bring the Ancestor back.

Alva: It is we who follow their word, commander. Not the other way around. My apologies, Dr. Sobeck. Our people's faith is strong, but there are those who are not as familiar with the Legacy as they should be.

Quen Marine: You heard the Diviner! The data has been found. You two, with me. The rest of you - meet us back at the beach for return to Landfall.

Alva: I can't talk long. They will have many questions.

Aloy: So do I! Your people know a lot about the past And about Sobeck. I guess. But there--.

Alva: Please. I must know. What you said before, about working towards the same goal? How long will it take?

Aloy: I don't know. A few months.

Alva: Then you are my family's best hope. Let nothing get in your way. You have opened my eyes to many things. And for that. I thank you. But now you must go.

Aloy: Will I see you again?

Alva: Soon we return to Legacy's Landfall. It might be dangerous for you to go there.

Aloy: Tell me how to reach it - just in case.

Alva: We made Landfall on the northeast edge of the Sunken City. The currents around the archipelago are vicious, and the only approach is from the south, and it is guarded. Only attempt to go there if you must.

Quen Marine: Diviner! What's the delay?

Alva: Please. Go. If you attempt to stay here any longer they may want to take you with us and that won't go well, for anyone.

[Aloy leaves the Greenhouse.]

Aloy: I better do as Alva says. I need to get DEMETER back to GAIA, anyway. But I might want to explore the area before I make the trek back to base. And now I can use the Vine Cutter on those other Metal Flowers I found earlier.

[Trying to waste as little time as possible she returns to the base. Aloy overhears her friends talking.]

Zo: The Old Ones liked to dance.

Varl: Well they didn't have two left feet, like I do.

Zo: I could teach you.

Varl: Don't tempt me.

Erend: By the forge, find an inn and leave me alone.

Varl: Aloy. Is that what I think it is?

Aloy: Just need to merge it with GAIA and she'll have enough power to handle HEPHAESTUS.

Varl: Good news. So, what can I do for you?

Aloy: Hope Zo's not upset I'm distracting you from your training.

Varl: Yeah, I don't think you have to worry about that…

Aloy: What do you mean? What happened?

Varl: Before Zo found a way to fix the land-gods I suggested that when GAIA was fully restored she could just make new ones.

Aloy: Well once we get HEPHAESTUS that's definitely a possibility.

Varl: That's what I said. But I guess there was something about my tone she didn't like. She got pretty raw. Said I didn't understand the way her tribe feels about those machines. Which is true, of course. And the last thing I ever want to do is dismiss their traditions But I was trying to look at things differently. More like you. You know, to see a machine as just a machine.

Aloy: Yeah. I guess I led you into trouble there, didn't I?

Varl: Not your fault. Don't worry.

Aloy: Did you talk to Zo after your fight?

Varl: I suffered through a few hours of glaring silence. Then she seemed to move on. Sort of. How do people do this? How do I know if the next thing I say won't blow up in my face? What if an apology is not enough next time?

Aloy: You give her a stuffed animal?

Varl: You're the worst you know that?

Aloy: What makes you think I know anything about any of this? You're on your own.

Varl: Abandoning me again, huh? Well, if she kills me next time, it's on you.

Aloy: Better get this to GAIA.

Varl: You did it, Aloy.

Aloy: Let's hold off on the ale till it's over and done with.

Varl: I'll let Erend know.

[Aloy finds Zo.]

Zo: Aloy. You've returned. And you come bearing gifts. Does this mean we'll soon be able to uproot the Zeniths from our lands?

Aloy: That's what I'm hoping.

Zo: Good.

Aloy: It looked like you were working on something over there.

Zo: With GAIA now growing in strength. I've been trying to find a way to heal the land-gods. Even if some people think I should give up on them.

Varl: Already said I was sorry!

Zo: Your friend thought it'd be a good idea to replace the land-gods with new machines when GAIA recovers.

Varl: It wasn't.

Zo: The land-gods have taken care of our people for generations. They are not some broken toy to be thrown away. Even if they are just machines doing their job to abandon them in their time of suffering seems cruel.

Aloy: I'm… sure Varl understands that too.

Zo: He does now. I had to get pretty mad at him at first though.

Varl: You know I can hear you guys, right?

Aloy: Varl looks pretty focused.

Zo: He's been obsessing over the data revealed to us by POSEIDON. Just the other day we read about mountains hiding deep underwater that spew fire. If I understand correctly GAIA said the flames they release come from the very center of the earth. Like a heart, beating with the life of the world. As always, the cycle can be found in even the most unlikely of places. Of course, Varl's mostly interested in watching explosions happen underwater.

Aloy: You ever play that board game Erend set up?

Zo: Strike? I'm the one who gave it to him. I was hoping to distract him enough to Sparges that Tuikus he calls "Death Metal." No such luck.

Aloy: I should get going.

Zo: If you need me, you know where to find me. Aloy, there are more supplies in the chest. Help yourself.

[Aloy goes to Erend.]

Erend: Looks like you got what you wanted.

Aloy: Yeah. It's almost time to go after HEPHAESTUS.

Erend: Finally. We get to rock n' roll! At least that's how the Old Ones said it. I think.

Aloy: Bet you're used to that Focus by now.

Erend: I can hit machines in their weak points. I guess that's something. Wish all the other data was as easy to deal with. To be honest, it's hard to understand half of what's on there. And the other half reminds me this isn't a fight you can win by just waving a hammer. Which is kind of what I do. But hey. That just means I gotta study harder. Make myself useful.

Aloy: Just give it time. What else have you been studying with your Focus?

Erend: I've been looking into this "Vegas" place you found. GAIA showed us everything that happened when you went to get that POSEIDON thing. This Morlund guy seems pretty smart. Though risking the Tenakth Clan Lands for a light show is a… bold move.

Aloy: Maybe I should check up on them at some point, just in case.

Erend: Right.

Aloy: Anything happen I should know about?

Erend: Zo asked us to help her bring more plants in here. Not for eating, apparently. If you ask me, place is fine as it is. Metal might be plain, but it's sturdy. Nothing wrong with that. Who needs a bunch of vegetation?

Aloy: I should get going.

Erend: Say hi to GAIA for me.

[On the way to Kotallo’s room Aloy overhears Varl and Zo.]

Varl: Did you know there used to be a rainforest so big the Old Ones called it the “lungs of the planet”?

Zo: That sounds lovely.

Varl: Yeah, they burned it to the ground at some point.

Zo: Oh.

Varl: But they helped bring part of it back in Sobeck's time.

Zo: That's good to hear. I wonder if it grew back after Zero Dawn? Wherever it is.

Varl: I'd like to think so.

[Aloy visits Kotallo.]

Kotallo: The world is in peril and we fight amongst ourselves.

Aloy: You busy?

Kotallo: One must never be idle when at war. But there is always time to speak to one's commander.

Aloy: Oh, that's… that's not really how I see myself.

Kotallo: It is how we see you.

Aloy: Anything interesting happen while I was away?

Kotallo: I found an acceptable place to practice with my blade.

Aloy: Oh. And where is that?

Kotallo: Outside, above the base. There's a nest of Sunwings that are always up for a fight.

Aloy: Ever thought of sparring with something that's not trying to kill you?

Kotallo: That would defeat the purpose of the training.

Aloy: Anything else you've been looking at with that Focus?

Kotallo: GAIA showed me the… knowledge you recovered out in the desert. I am no Chaplain, but I'd be curious to test if something I read is true.

Aloy: What is it?

Kotallo: The Old Ones believed one could hear the great waters even in the middle of the desert… …if you carried the carcass of a water animal with you. They called them sea shells.

Aloy: That sounds… kind of gross. What have you been up to?

Kotallo: Varl has asked to learn the differences between my people's clans. So I’ve been teaching him Tenakth history. It is heavy with blood and death. But also with honorable deeds and vanquished tyrants. Maybe you'd like to hear about it as well, when our mission is done.

Aloy: I'd be honored. I'll let you get back to your training.

Kotallo: And so will I.

[And finally Aloy goes to GAIA.]

GAIA: It is good to see you again, Aloy. I see you have recovered DEMETER. 

[Aloy inserts DEMETER’s code into GAIA’s console.]

GAIA: Aloy. With the acquisition of AETHER, POSEIDON, and DEMETER my heuristic processing density has expanded greatly. I should now be able to absorb HEPHAESTUS. And fortunately we have made progress on a plan to capture it. 

[Varl and Beta enter the room.]

GAIA: With Varl's encouragement, Beta analyzed all available information on HEPHAESTUS. Its expansion has been rampant. It is too large to be beamcast, and the kernel you have been using could never hold it. Therefore, it must be contained in a location with a direct physical connection to me - a place with two data cores.

Aloy: Two cores? Where would we find a place like that?

Beta: GEMINI.

GAIA: An abandoned Cauldron in the desert west of here. Seismic activity disrupted the original construction. Two data cores were built as a result.

Aloy: I've been there. The Tenakth marked the entrance as some kind of ritual ground. We'll have to bring you there by hand.

GAIA: I have devised a blueprint for a suitable, albeit unwieldy, transport rig. It will require two people to carry it to GEMINI.

Varl: I can help.

GAIA: Once I am installed on the first core… I will call down HEPHAESTUS on the other trapping it. I will then initiate the merge. However, in order to construct the rig, I will need considerable help.

Aloy: Can you build it?

Beta: I suppose I could, but it's not going to work. The Zeniths will find you. MINERVA won't be able to conceal your location.

GAIA: That is correct. Absorbing HEPHAESTUS will create a significant power surge easily detected by anyone capable of noticing.

Aloy: But what if there were multiple power surges to fake out the Zeniths? If Erend yo and Kotallo spread out to other Cauldrons and create their own surges, would those conceal the one at GEMINI?

GAIA: Analyzing. Such a tactic might be effective. With Beta's help, we should be able to build a set of handheld pulse generators.

Beta: I told you. It's not going to work! I did a test. HEPHAESTUS has written Alpha Clearance out of its access module. You'll never be able to capture it!

Aloy: Then we need a higher level of clearance.

Beta: There is no higher-- Ted Faro's Omega Clearance… …the one he used to purge the APOLLO database and kill the Alphas. But to get it, you would have to find Thebes, the private bunker he retreated to when the world ended. And nobody knows where that is, not even the Zeniths! Their only intel was that it was somewhere in San Francisco.

Aloy: That might be all I need. Alva, the Quen Diviner I met, said her people had setup a base at Landfall. They were searching for data in San Francisco from there. She might be able to help. So, I guess I'm headed all the way west. While I'm gone, will you be able to build the rig and the pulse generators?

Beta: I'll try.

Varl: I'll make sure she has what she needs.

[Everyone except Aloy leaves GAIA’s room.]

Aloy: Alva said the Quen have a ferry on the coast that they use to get to the ruins of San Francisco. That's where I need to go.

[“SEEDS OF THE PAST” mission completed!]

FARO’S TOMB
[Aloy continues to talk to GAIA.]

Aloy: I'm back, GAIA.

GAIA: Hello, Aloy What would you like to discuss? 

Aloy: Have you been able to make use  of DEMETER s functions? 

GAIA: Yes. I was able to mitigate most soil conditions and restore a temporary balance. You should notice less rampant plant growth in the area 

Aloy: Maybe that'll give Plain Songs fields a chance to recover.

GAIA: Unfortunately, recovery in that area is unlikely without  the assistance of the Utaru’s “land gods” I have discussed this matter with Zo. I believe we may have a workaround.

Aloy: Yeah, I'm helping her out with that. There's something I'm still trying to figure out. Why was DEMETER using flying machines to distribute Metal Flowers 

GAIA: In its deranged state, DEMETER was defending itself against a robotic swarm that would devour all plant life. 

Aloy: It thought the Faro Plaque was still happening?

GAIA: It feared it would come again. As part of its directive of reseeding Earth's vegetation it sought to protect plant life at all costs. And considering I had twenty years to proliferate, I expect you will continue to find the fruits of its efforts for some time. 

Aloy: It's a good thing I have the code to dissolve the vines, then. The Zeniths - Gerard, Erik, Tilda, Verbena. Beta said they were some of the most powerful people on Earth. I think Elisabet knew one of them - Tilda, Did she ever mention her to you? 

GAIA: No. Elisabet often spoke of her work, or told stories of her mother and her childhood. If she knew this Tilda, she did not disclose it with me. What we can conclude, from your and Beta's experiences, is that the Zeniths are ruthless in pursuit of their goal. To protect life on Earththey must be stopped 

Aloy: Beta's convinced we won't be able to capture HEPHAESTUS. With that attitude, do you really think she'll be able to build the rig and pulse generators? 

GAIA: It may take some coaxing, but with some assistance, I am confident she will 

Aloy: I don't get her, GAIA She's so quick to assume we'll fail. She's nothing like-- Like what I thought she'd be. I guess it'll be best if she stays here when we go to GEMINI. All this data I’ve picked up in ancient bunkers and ruins… I guess I never  really thought that other people would be looking at it.

GAIA: Based on my observations, your companions engage quite frequently with this material. Erend has asked on numerous occasions about “birthday parties.” He appears perplexed by the tradition of serving a sweet confection... as it conflicts with the seram tradition of serving sparkling stout ale. He also suggested we host a party for you, as a surprise.

Aloy: Uh... yeah, no thanks.

GAIA: That is what I predicted. 

Aloy: Is Kotallo getting along with everyone?

GAIA: Yes, though the prefers to spend most of the time alone. He appears to be collating data on war machine progression and significant battles, during the Faro Plague... ...to aid in the creation of a war map of Operation Enduring Victory. I believe he aims to study the tactics of Old World Warfare. 

Aloy: I'd be interested in seeing that.

GAIA: It appears to be a private pastime for him. He has repeatedly declined my offers to assist his research. 

Aloy: So our plan to capture HEPHAESTUS. Let's go over it again. 

GAIA: As you wish thanks to Beta’s test, we now know that HERHEASTUS will not respond to your Alpha Clearance. Which is why you will need to procure Ted Faro's Omega Clearance.

Aloy: Right from his personal bunker, Thebes. 

GAIA: While you are gone, I will assist Beta in building the transport rig and pulse generators. When we get to GEMINI, I will need to be installed on one of the facility's cores. The second core is for HEPHAESTUS. Using Omega Clearance will allow you to trap it.

Aloy: And then you'll be able to absorb it?

GAIA: Not quite. You will need to manually remove HEPHAESTUS malicious code before the merge.

Aloy: How long will that take?

GAIA: There are calculations I must run, but I estimate a few hours.

Aloy: And during that time, the others will create a distraction for us using the pulse generators, right?

GAIA: Correct. They will each take position at a Cauldron door and fire off their device. The energy surge should mask our activities until the merge is complete.

Aloy: And then we'll have everything we need to defeat the Zeniths. Sounds like a plan. So - now that you have AETHER DEMETER and POSEIDON. How's the biosphere looking?

GAIA: In the local region conditions have improved. Super storms have subsided. Water sources have been purified. And soil conditions remediated. These improvements will stave off environmental collapse for a few additional months

Aloy: Well with luck, soon you'll have HEPHAESTUS. Then you'll be able to fix the biosphere for good, right?

GAIA: Correct. I will be able to design and produce robotic agents to permanently reverse the environmental damage that has accumulated.

Aloy: There's something I've been wondering. How could Ted Faro create a clearance level higher than Alpha? Elisabet made sure he wouldn't interfere with the project.

GAIA: It is plausible he tasked his own engineers with creating a backdoor to the Zero Dawn system, without Elisabets knowledge. My predecessor did not even know of its existence, until he activated to purge the APOLLO database. It is, in effect, a blind spot. One that will allow us to subdue HEPHAESTUS. And fortunately, thanks to Beta's information we know where Omega Clearance may be procured.

Aloy: Right. Somewhere in San Francisco. So GEMINI has two data cores. I've never seen a Cauldron like that. But you mentioned something about seismic activity?

GAIA: When my predecessor attempted to build the Cauldron, construction was disrupted by a series of earthquakes. The data core had already been built but the rest of the facility sustained damage. So she began again. A second core was built. However, when more tremblors occurred, she abandoned the site.

Aloy: Lucky for us. Are the quakes still happening?

GAIA: No, thought they did also create instabilities to other facilities in the region.

Aloy: So, the facility where I recovered DEMETER used to be a Faro agricultural research facility. It's where they created the biomass conversion system... but also Adamantine Wreath. Did Elisabet know they were working on that?

GAIA: It is likely she was briefed on other efforts to combat the machine swarm. though her focus was devoted only to Zero Dawn.

Aloy: That makes sense. But they actually got the wreaths to work. If they'd been able to deploy it against the Faro Plague in time...

GAIA: Using the data you recovered on the project, I ran several simulations and have concluded that it would never have worked. In all scenarios, the Faro war machines would eventually hack and deactivate the wreaths before, they could contain the swarm.

Aloy: So Zero Dawn really was the only solution. There was a lot of data in the Greenhouse facility about agriculture. Do you think it'll help the Quen fix their homeland?

GAIA: I will run a query. Complete. The data contains information about novel crop production methods, which may be beneficial for the tribe in the long term.

Aloy: But new crops aren't going to save the world. So I guess it's on us.

GAIA: It is.

Aloy: I found some data in one of the rooms you unlocked. It mentioned that there are still functional seed banks beneath this facility. Why's it there?

GAIA: My predecessor was tasked with reconstituting the biosphere with primary and secondary plant species. Had everything gone according to plan humans would have eventually been able to introduce tertiary species, including new crops.

Aloy: Can we access them now?

GAIA: Unfortunately, it will have to wait. I require control over the machines in order to access and distribute the preserved seed stock.

Aloy: And for that we need HEPHAESTUS. It's something to look into later, then. See you later GAIA.

GAIA: Until next time, Aloy.

[Aloy gets back to her friends in the next room.]

Erend: So. We're fighting immortals from the stars now?

Varl: Looks like it.

Erend: What’s next? Wizards? From the moon? (Aloy approaches) What's this I hear about you going west?

Aloy: Turns out we need one last thing before we can grab HEPHAESTUS.

Erend: 'Cause it would've been too easy otherwise.

Aloy: You been looking at any interesting data?

Erend: I asked GAIA to find me something to look at a while back. And she found the mother of all forges. They called it: sports. Turns out the Old Ones spent a lot of time tackling and punching each other for points in one game or another. You mix in some salty food and fresh ale, I bet half the Claim would be lining up to watch.

Aloy: How are things with Kotallo? You still scared of him?

Erend: Oh, she thinks she's funny. Actually, I played Strike with him. Had to fill in most of the conversation myself. But I'm still alive.

Aloy: Glad to hear it. I need to get going.

Erend: I think I know the answer, but, are you sure you don't need any help? GAIA mentioned this other tribe you found. The Quen. They sound like a nasty bunch.

Aloy: I can handle them. In the meantime, Varl will help you get ready for what comes next.

Erend: Take care of yourself, Aloy.

[Aloy walks to Varl.]

Varl: I'm sorry. Aloy. After all the trouble you went through you have to head west again.

Aloy: Well, no one said this was going to be easy.

Varl: You sure you don't want any backup dealing with the Quen?

Aloy: They think I'm Sobeck, or something like that. They won't hurt me but I doubt they'll be so kind to anyone else.

Varl: If you say so. Let me know if you need anything before you go.

Aloy: You better not be slacking off on your studies while I'm gone.

Varl: And risk Zo coming after me? I value my life. In fact, I've been reading about Ted Faro. How he destroyed the world and crawled into a hole after killing those who saved it.

Aloy: He definitely was a piece of work. While Beta and GAIA build the rig, can you get everyone ready for the mission ahead?

Varl: Of course.

Aloy: What is it?

Varl: Nothing. It's just that everything's about to change. We'll get GAIA And she'll help us set things right. No more Zeniths. No more Derangement. It'll be a different world. I welcome it. But… I wonder how the Nora will react. And the Carja. And, well, everyone.

Aloy: Let's just focus on fixing GAIA for now.

Varl: You're right We've got an angry AI to take down.

Aloy: If I get Omega Clearance, and then we grab HEPHAESTUS, we might finally have the advantage over the Zeniths.

Varl: Can't wait to see their faces as they stare down a bunch of charging Thunderjaws.

Aloy: Better them than us. For once. I'll be in touch if I need anything.

Varl: I'll make sure Beta briefs everyone on the pulse generators.

Aloy: Good.

[Aloy walks to Zo.]

Zo: Aloy. I hear you're going further past the Tenakth Clan Lands.

Aloy: Do you know anything about the area?

Zo: Only hearsay. The Utaru tell stories of an island that lies beyond the western coast. They call it the Isle of Spires. It is said the Old Ones built towers there that touch the sky, so they could live far away from the earth that bore them. As if they didn't want to be reminded that they'd one day return to it.

Aloy: Sounds like something Ted Faro would do. How much have you read on Ted Faro?

Zo: Enough to wonder how a man who worked so hard to heal the world once… ...could let greed and pride condemn it so easily. For one's spirit to diminish in such a way - I'm not sure if I should hate him... or pity him.

Aloy: You and Varl doing okay? Training, I mean.

Zo: We're doing fine. Although I admit it'd be nice to take a small break from studying, just the two of us. But then who'd look after Erend?

Aloy: There's always Kotallo.

Zo: Leave a loud Oseram with a brooding Tenakth. What could go wrong?

Aloy: What's everyone been up to?

Zo: I've been trying to share some of my meals with Beta. Thought it might help her feel more at home. Maybe even get her to sleep up here instead of in that dark basement. She would not be moved.

Aloy: I appreciate you trying.

Zo: Patience reaps the best harvest. I'm not giving up hope yet.

Aloy: Any progress with your plan for the land-gods? Is the reboot code ready?

Zo: It is. But there is difficult work ahead. GAIA warned me that because the land-gods are linked together in a "network," the code must be delivered to all of them. Most are in Plainsong. But in recent years, three of them wandered off - So, Ti and Do. 

Aloy: We have to find them?

Zo: No. We know where they are. But they're hard to reach. So wandered into a lake and sank. Do ventured into a dangerous canyon. And Ti broke down amidst a herd of machines.

Aloy: Okay. Tell you what - you go to Plainsong, handle all the land-gods there. I'll take care of So, Ti, and Do. I'll need their locations, plus the reboot code.

Zo: I'm sending the data to you now. My people made shrines near where each land-god faltered. When you see them. you'll know you're close. And once again - thanks for your help.

Aloy: We're not going to let your people starve, Zo. I promise. Well, I should get going. Hopefully I can bring back what we need to capture HEPHAESTUS. After that, I'm going to need everyone's help.

Zo: We'll be ready.

What Was Lost (start)
[Aloy visits Kotallo.]

Kotallo: (to himself) The rebels know exactly where to hit us.

Aloy: Got a minute?

Kotallo: As many as you need.

Aloy: I have to travel beyond the western coast.

Kotallo: To the ruins shrouded in fog.

Aloy: Yes. And I'm looking for a tribe, the Quen. I encountered them once before. They said they came from across the great ocean. I was hoping the Tenakth knew more about them.

Kotallo: Hmm. There were rumors of trespassers in the area. But we thought they were just bandits. Hekarro sent out a patrol or two but I don't recall them reporting back. We've had more pressing concerns, as you know. I'm sorry, that's all I can tell you.

Aloy: It's okay. I guess I'll find out soon enough.

Kotallo: There is something I've been meaning to discuss with you. It's... personal. If you have a moment to spare.

Aloy: You said there was something you wanted to talk about?

Kotallo: I've been speaking with GAIA. She mentioned that the Zeniths bind metal with flesh to make themselves stronger. I was wondering. if you'd help me do the same.

Aloy: You want to make yourself a new arm.

Kotallo: Yes. GAIA insists she can help me build such a thing, if I can get the necessary data and materials. She believes these things lie in the place where Beta hid from the Zeniths.

Aloy: Their ancient research lab.

Kotallo:I am not as familiar with Old World machinery as you are. I could use your assistance.

Aloy: It might be dangerous. The Zeniths probably still keep an eye on that place. We were lucky to get out of there alive the first time.

Kotallo: I see.

Aloy: But sounds like this is worth the risk.

Kotallo: By the Ten, we shall see it through.

Aloy: Found anything interesting during your training?

Kotallo: GAIA told me where to find data on how wars were waged in the Old World. I knew the Ten fought against machines, much as we do now. But it seems they were among the last of their kind. Later, machines battled other machines… ...as they vied for lands and spoils. At least the Tenakth have the courage to put their lives on the line when conflicts arise.

Aloy: There is nobility in that But maybe we just need fewer conflicts in the first place.
Kotallo: Yes. Of course. Hekarro would have it so, as well.

Aloy: What do Tenakth do to relax? You know, to take a break from training.

Kotallo: We play Strike. Your Oseram friend, is surprisingly good at it. Although he has yet to beat me. It helps one think strategically. Hones the mind for tactics.

Aloy: Somehow that still sounds like training. I should get going I've got a long road ahead.

Kotallo: Should you need reinforcements...

Aloy: I know who to call. I'll call you when I'm near the Zenith lab. We'll get what you need for that new arm of yours.

Kotallo: Thank you. Aloy.

Aloy: Itp herself)  Beta's so frustrating. I don't get how she can be so negative all the time. I mean, we're clones of the same woman. And yet she couldn't be more different from Elisabet.

[She visits Beta, who works on the generators.]

Beta: It's you.

Aloy: Hey, me again.

Beta: Was there something else?

Aloy: So do you have everything you need to build the rig and pulse generators?

Beta: GAIA sent me the schematics. The designs are… modest without the capabilities of HEPHAESTUS. But they should work. Not that it matters without Omega Clearance.

Aloy: I'll find it. Just try to have the transport ready by the time I get back. So, have you been upstairs at all?

Beta: Not really.

Beta: Varl sometimes comes down here to talk. He keeps asking if I'm okay. I thought he only wanted to know about my productivity… but it’s almost like he actually wants to talk with me.

Aloy: Yeah, I think he does. Have you talked with anyone else in the base?

Beta: I speak with GAIA. She asks me how I'm feeling and my opinion on various topics. I didn't expect that from an AI.

Aloy: That's all thanks to Elisabet. She believed GAIA had to care, not just follow her programming orders.

Beta: I know. Independent, emotional processing enabled the previous version of GAIA to create you, after all.

Aloy: Yeah, I guess so. So, aside from Varl and GAIA, who else have you been talking to?

Beta: Zo told me how you met after your escape from the HADES Proving Lab. I had no idea you were severely injured. If the Zeniths had killed you, Life on Earth would be doomed. My escape would've been for nothing.

Aloy: But they didn't kill me. And thanks to Varl and Zo, I was able to recover. You said you and Varl talk sometimes. What about?

Beta: He told me about your tribe - the Nora - and the Proving ritual you did. I told him if I was born into the tribe, I'd never be able to do the Proving.

Aloy: It does require a lot of physical training. But there are plenty of other roles besides being a hunter.

Beta: I don't think I'd be suited for any of them.

Aloy: Well, I guess it's a good thing you're not a Nora, then. That's enough for now.

Beta: Good.

[Aloy decides to explore the opened rooms and finds a ventilation shaft.]

Aloy: I don't think that door had power before. But looks like it's malfunctioning. Looks like some kind of maintenance space. I wonder where this leads. Power cells. Huh.

[SHe inserts the missing power call.]

Aloy: That did it.

Erend: (via Focus) Uh, Aloy? A bunch of lights just turned on up here. Was that you?

Aloy: Oh. Huh. Yeah, I guess it was.

[She continues exploring.]

Aloy: Was this door always locked?

GAIA: (via Focus) Beta requested the use of that room as her personal space. I have locked it at her request.

Aloy: Okay. Looks like a power cell could fit here. Okay. That console has power now. 

[She listens to an audiolog.]

Aloy: "The Vault." I found a locked door behind the vent in the basement... wonder if that's it? 

[She reads the screen on the console.]

Aloy: From the looks of this data, HEPHAESTUS has been trying to hack into the Repair Bay. Okay. Doesn't look like it's been able to.

[She returns to the main room to her friends.]

Zo: I wouldn't have taught you the song. I didn't like the way you sing it.

Varl: So you like hearing me butcher Utaru music?

Erend: I sure don't. You sound like a dying Longleg.

[Quickly tired of them Aloy returns to the wilds.]

Kotallo: (via Focus) Aloy - it's a long way to the coast. If you need to resupply en route, I suggest stopping in Fall's Edge. It's a Lowland Clan village southwest of the Grove, in the heart of the jungle.

Aloy: Got it. Thanks for the advice.

Drowned Hopes (start)
Lora: A buddy of mine told me about a Carja expedition down south. Place called Jagged Deep. They think there's something special in the big lake down there. Old World relics of some sort. Too bad machines decided to spoil the delve for everyone.

Aloy: Sounds like bad luck.

Aloy: (to herself) The Carja might've found something interesting down there. Could be worth checking out.

The Second Verse (continue)
Aloy: Two dead Utaru. And a land-god shrine. Zo said this one broke down amidst a herd of machines. I better be careful. I guess they were leaving offerings to the land-god. It looks like something... fried them. Whatever did it might still be around. There's the land-god. But I'll have to deal with those machines before I install the reboot code. 

[She goes into battle with the machines.]

Aloy: Could use that heavy weapon if I can tear it off. Well, hello. Relief. Stunned - got an opening! Think that's all of the machines. Time to install this code on that land-god. Stormbird! Must have been what killed those Utaru. Acid's corroding its armor! Okay, let's get this code installed on that land-god.

[Dealing with the Stormbird she tries to insert the code again.]

Aloy: I should install this code on that land-god. Let's try this again. Nice and easy. One down, two to go.

Aloy: Zo? You there?

Zo: (via Focus) I'm here, Aloy.

Aloy: I found Ti and installed the reboot code.

Zo: (via Focus) Fitting then that I feel thankful. Ti's festival came in winter, when all the grain from the harvest was stored away. It was the season of gratitude, and all the children would receive gifts. The best was my first bow. made of yew. strung by my father.

Aloy: Well, he definitely taught you how to shoot well.

Zo: (via Focus) That he did.

Aloy: There's one more thing. I found two of your people. A Stormbird got them, but I took it down.

Zo: (via Focus) Oh I'll make sure someone retrieves their seed pouches so they may return to the land.

[Aloy goes in search of the next land-god.]

Aloy: There. One of the land-god shrines. Zo said this one sank in a nearby lake. The land-god must be down there somewhere. Time for a swim. I think the land-god is underneath that rubble. I better stay away from that Snapmaw. I need to get to that land-god so I can install the reboot code.

[She deals with the Snapmaw.]

Aloy: Shocked and locked! That should make things easier. Let's get this code to the land-god. Here we go. This should help you get back on track. That should do it. Another land-god dealt with. Hey, Zo?

Zo: (via Focus) Aloy. How goes it?

Aloy:  Had to swim a bit, but I gave the reboot code to So.

Zo: (via Focus) Ah. Good. We used to celebrate So in the fall at the beginning of the harvest with wine made from elderflowers. When I was twelve, I got tipsy on it and kissed a boy in the sage garden.

Aloy: How'd that go?

Zo: (via Focus) He was so surprised he nearly fell into the mulch. It would be good to see So again, plowing the fields in the afternoon sun.

Aloy: How are things on your end?

Zo: (via Focus) Getting there. A few land-gods to visit still.

Aloy: Okay. I'll call you when I'm done with the last one.

Zo: (via Focus) Thank you, Aloy.

[Aloy finds the last land-god.]

Aloy: This must be the shrine for the land-god Do. Hmm. Must be past those vines. Let's take a look. Gotta climb up to that land-god. It looks like this one's been here for a while. I won't be able to install the reboot code with these vines in the way. But where there's vines, there's a Metal Flower. I just have to find it. There. The Flower. If I can deactivate it, the land-god will be free from the vines. But I'll have to find a way up there. There we go. Should be able to access that cave now. A Dreadwing carcass. It must have dropped the Flowers, and then crashed. Looks like I can climb up the side of the cliff. Might help me get to that Metal Flower. Now I just need to get rid of these vines. That's better Time to get this code installed. This will help you get better. That's the last land-god. Zo, can you hear me?

Zo: (via Focus) I can hear you, Aloy.

Aloy: Just planted the reboot code on Do. He was a bit tangled up, but he's better now.

Zo: (via Focus) Good to hear Do always returned to the sacred cave at the end of winter. So his festival foretold the coming of spring. During those times, I remember clinging to my mother by the hearth, snuggling for warmth, and listening to her sing of new beginnings.

Aloy: Which is exactly what you're going to give to your people.

Zo: (via Focus) I hope so. When you can meet me at Plainsong and we'll send out the reboot signal. I've delivered the code to all the land-gods, save one. Only La is left. I'm here with her, just east of the main village.

Aloy: Okay. I'll get there as soon as I can.

[She rides to ]

NPC: What is she doing to La? /yes, the name is from the game/

Zo: Aloy, you made it. All of the land-gods have been updated. Now to send out the reboot signal.

[The land-god, La, stands up and starts roaring strangely.]

Aloy: They're... singing.

Utaru Farmer: The singing. What does this mean?

Zo: A new beginning. GAIA told me this would happen to all of them - Do, Ti, So, and the rest. She called it a "reboot sequence." But I didn't think it would be so beautiful. Soon the land-gods will return to tilling the soil as they once did.

Messenger: Zo - the Chorus wants a word.

Zo: Of course they do.

Aloy: Do you want me to come?

Zo: No need. I'll just tell them that our lands will soon bloom again. Who are they to argue? Find me later and I'll tell you how it went.

Aloy: Good luck.

[“The Second Verse” side quest completed!]

What Was Lost (continue)
Aloy: That's where Kotallo said we’d find what he needs to build himself a new arm. I should let him know I’m around. Hey Kotallo? I'm at the Zenith Lab. Ready to come over?

Kotallo: (via Focus) I'm on my way.

[Some time later Kotallo approaches Aloy.]

Kotallo: Aloy. I appreciate you meeting me here.

Aloy: I'm happy to help. Did GAIA mention where exactly in the Zenith Lab we'd find what you need?

Kotallo: She mentioned the chamber where you found Beta, and the "database" that lies within. She said it'll help us find the knowledge and components I require to build a new arm.

Aloy: At least we know where to look. We will have to be quick about it in case the Zeniths are watching.

Kotallo: Understood.

Aloy: The labs up this way.

[They climb the snowy mountain. Despite the difficulties of climbing with one arm, he selflessly overcomes all difficulties.]

Aloy: You okay?

Kotallo: I got this.

Aloy: Machines. They're scrapping the Specters for parts.

Kotallo: Should we dispose of them?

Aloy: Or we can sneak past them.

Kotallo: Your choice.

Aloy: I'm catching snowflakes on my lashes.

[Machines notice Aloy and Kotallo.]

Kotallo: Battle it is.

[They win.]

Aloy: Entrance to the lab is by that tunnel. C'mon.

[They enter a tunnel dug by a giant machine.]

Kotallo: The enemy did this?

Aloy: Hard to believe, but yeah.

Kotallo: Enemies up ahead.

Aloy: That hunter-killer means trouble. We better get a move on. The room we found Beta in is up ahead.

Kotallo: Lead the way.

Aloy: Okay, then.

Kotallo: Is that it down there?

Aloy: Yeah, we better make our way down there. This'll break my fall! We're here. Now we just need to find a way to access the database GAIA was talking about.

Kotallo: Varl mentioned you found Beta in one of those pods. There's barely room to breathe. Don't think we're supposed to go that way.

Aloy: I think I found what we're looking for.

Kotallo: Let's hope it holds the answers we seek.

Aloy: I'll download the database to your Focus so you can search through it later.

Kotallo: What about the components?

Aloy: They should be somewhere on the--Specters! Getting somewhere! Time to follow up! The Zeniths might send reinforcements. We need to finish up and get out of here. The components should be somewhere on the second floor.

Kotallo: I'm right behind you.

Aloy: We need to search the entire floor.

Kotallo: I'll keep a lookout. Don't want any more surprises.

Aloy: Good idea. A vent. Might be a way out of this room. The components have to be here somewhere. Please tell me the components are in there. Gotcha. I should go back and give these to Kotallo.

Kotallo: You found the components?

Aloy: See for yourself.

Kotallo: You have my thanks, Aloy.

Aloy: Something wrong?

Kotallo: I was just thinking about what it will be like after I build the arm. Will I feel different? Whole again? Bah. Idle thoughts. They can wait until we're back at base.

Aloy: You go on ahead. I might want to take one more look around in case there's anything useful.

Kotallo: Very well. I look forward to putting what we found to good use. Walk with the Ten.

[After searching the lab, Aloy returns to base.]

Zo: Aloy. May we speak? You're back. Good. Before we talk, I wanted to give you this. For helping me heal the land gods. Plainsong is in your debt.

Aloy: Thank you, Zo.

Zo: You deserve much more, for all you've done. May the land always bloom in your steps.

Aloy: And... yours? How'd it go with the Chorus after we fixed the land-gods?

Zo: They were shocked when I told them that our lands would soon be on the mend. I thought Fane's eyes would pop out of his head. But of course they had no choice but to take it as good news… even if it meant all their preaching about meekly accepting our doom was exposed as rot. To be honest, I found the conversation to be highly enjoyable.

Aloy: I'm glad. You deserve it. They're lucky that you never gave up on saving them. I assume you've been looking into DEMETER now that GAIA's merged with it?

Zo: Yes. It's been... humbling. To know that the seeds I carry in this pouch came in turn from the seeds saved for DEMETER in the Old World… It gives me hope that the cycle of life will prevail now.just as it did before.

Aloy: I should go.

Zo: Back to studying it is.

Aloy: (to herself) Plugging in that power cell downstairs must've turned on these holograms. Talanah must've left this for me on her way back east. I wish she could've stayed, but I know Meridian and the Lodge need her.

Zo: (from afar) What?

Varl: Nothing. You just look good that's all.

Zo: Get back to studying.

[Aloy visits Kotallo.]

Kotallo: You were gone for a while.

Aloy: How's it going with the arm?

Kotallo: It is nearly complete But I am still adjusting the fittings. Soon I must test it.

Aloy: Looking forward to it. I should leave.

Kotallo: Proceed with caution.

[And Aloy hits the wild again.]

Aloy: This must be Fall's Edge, Kotallo said I could resupply here, then head for the Quen ferry.

The Valley Of The Fallen (start)
Nakko: You've really done it this time, Daxx. An honor, Champion. I'm Nakko. Have you been out to the Valley of the Fallen, by chance?

Aloy: Don't think I have. Why, what's there?

Nakko: My idiot little brother. The valley is a test of endurance and skill for my clan, the Lowlanders. But it's been closed for months - commander's orders. There have been reports of strange lights off the coast. And the whole area's crawling with deadly machines. But Daxx, reckless and bare-armed as he is, went in anyway. Never takes "no" for an answer. Convinced two others to go with him, too. They've been missing for days. And now Marshal Ivvira's been sent in to bail them out.

Aloy: Strange lights, deadly machines, and missing soldiers. Sounds like a lot, even for a Marshal.

Nakko: I'd go by myself, if I wasn't stuck on transport duty.

Aloy: I'll find your brother, if I can. Where is this valley?

Nakko: South of here, towards the coast. Look for the climbing path on the cliffs. It marks the start of the valley. And if you see my brother... knock him on his ass for making me worry.

Aloy: (to herself) Strange lights off the coast… whatever it is, it can't be good. I should look into it when I'm out that way.

Aloy: This writing... it's Carja. I think it was left behind by Marshal Fashav.

Tenakth Guard: They say you tamed insurgent Carja.

Aloy: Okay. Time to cross the water and look for Landfall - and Alva. No one here. That's strange. Well nothing stopping me from taking a boat. Current's pushing me south. There's no choice but to head for that beach. No one's guarding this side of the ferry, either. Where are the Quen? They're in Landfall, I guess. I better go find it. Should be to the northeast. Machine's resistant to fire. Let's see what I can do with this. Gotcha! Stripped it! 

[She finds a Tallneck partially submerged in water near the beach.]

Aloy: There's the Talineck that signaled my Focus. Gunthawks. Better be careful. Something seems to have knocked the Tallneck down. Maybe the current? I better take a look at the damage. Two parts are missing. Is that what the Glinthawk was carrying? Might be able to find the parts at their nest. Those Tallneck parts must be up there somewhere. I just have to get to them. Spotted. Ginthawk nests. Wonder if this is where those sunken latineck pants ended up. That looks like the part I'm looking for. That's over with. I should get back to the nest. Pick up the mem part I saw. Guess I'm picking this up! That’s the end of that. And I got a hold of one of those Tallneck parts. One down. One to go. Guess we're done here. The second Tallneck part. Lightning coursing through it! Picked up the last of the parts I need. I should get these back to the Tallneck. I should return these parts to that Tallneck. Get the big guy fixed. Let's hope this works. There we go. One more to go. That should do it. Welcome back. Now I just need to find a way to climb aboard. If I can get on land, I might be able to jump onto that Tallneck. I should be able to jump onto the Tallneck from here. Made it! Now to climb up to its head. There we go! Time to override the big guy. It's all right. I'm almost done. 

[Aloy gets a map of the area and continues her search.]

Aloy: Another drone keeping watch on the biosphere. I should grab its data. But how am I going to get it down? 

Faro’s Tomb (continue)
Aloy: That must be the entrance to Landfall up ahead.

[She enters the settlement.]

Quen Soldier 2: Hey. Hey. Is that her?

Quen Officer: The Living Ancestor!

Quen Soldier 2: The Diviner wasn't lying.

Aloy: This is Landfall, right? I'm looking for Alva.

Quen Soldier: Overseer Bohai ordered us to invite you before him, should you approach.

Quen Soldier 1: Please, come with me. Go. Let him know we're coming

Quen Soldier 3: It's her!

Quen Soldier 4: The Diviner was right.

Quen Soldier 2: Overseer Bohai! A stranger just walked through the gate.

Bohai: I knew Alva would not dare lie. You do look like Sobeck.

Aloy: Is Alva here? I need to talk to her.

Bohai: I will consider your request once it is determined what you are. A Living Ancestor, as Alva believes? Or a threat lurking in such a guise.

Aloy: I am no threat okay? Back on the mainland, your soldiers fired on me without warning.

Quen Officer: So you say, infidel. None of those you engaged survived to bear witness.

Aloy: I held off on your squad, when--

[Some regal looking man with two guards approaches.]

Bohai: May present our honored Ceo.

Ceo: So, here she is our great mystery. Well, Bohai? What have you divined? What is she?

Bohai: A mystery indeed, my Ceo. How can she appear as Sobeck and yet know nothing of our ways? Are we to believe that a Living Ancestor was born to this wretched land, an ocean apart from the realm of the chosen? And if so, to what end? I cannot answer. Only she can. But I warn you, no falsehood will satisfy us. Now - speak. Why are you here? What is your purpose?

Aloy: I'm looking for a place called Thebes.

Ceo: And what do you seek there?

Aloy: Alva told me a little about what you're after. I guess you could say I want what you want. A way to heal the world.

Ceo: As I suspected. Tell her.

Bohai: We found Thebes, the final resting place of Ted Faro's secrets. It isn't far but the way is closed to us. Machine attacks have cut us off from the site. Diviner Alva is there, along with a complement of diggers and soldiers.

Aloy: Is she all right?

Bohai: Our scouts tell us that a machine has our people pinned behind their defenses, but they're holding out.

Aloy: Machines, huh? I can help with that.

Bohai: Alva told us that you are indeed formidable.

Aloy: But I have a few questions first.

[Ceo sits on a chair and is poured some kind of drink.]

Ceo: We will answer what we can.

[Aloy sits down next to Ceo. Bohai jast stands.]

Aloy: So you found Thebes. How?

Bohai: The Ancestors revealed it to us not long after we made Landfall, almost a year ago… ...through a scrap of ancient data, discovered by Alva and verified by myself. It contained details about the construction of a great underground palace.

Aloy: Where exactly?

Bohai: Close. Beneath the great pyramid in the ruins beyond.

Aloy: Figures. Ted loved his pyramids. Have you been inside?

Bohai: Ah... no. That has been a problem. One of many.

Ceo: And we will solve them all, in time. Getting back to the site is the one at hand. I hope you're as effective against machines as Diviner Alva suggested.

Aloy: What exactly are you looking for inside Thebes? I thought Alva brought back the data you needed.

Bohai: We risked much to cross the ocean. Therefore we must unearth every possible link to the Legacy while we are here. Especially one as important as Thebes.

Ceo: We will not sail back until I have plundered its secrets.

Aloy: So, Alva reports to you?

Bohai: I was chosen by my colleagues on the Board of Overseers

Aloy: And you're in charge of the expedition?

Bohai: He is far more than that! You are addressing the cousin of the Emperor of the Quen… ...heir to the vast holdings of the Great Delta, the first Cea in five generations!

Ceo: All she needs to understand is that I am the authority here. And my will is to attain the secrets of Thebes.

Aloy: Mine, too. We're in luck. You crossed the ocean on these ships? Couldn't have been easy.

Ceo: Greatness is never easy.

Bohai: Indeed. It took seven years just to build the flotilla. This expedition is the most important undertaking of our generation. A quest for knowledge across the gaping sea, with nothing less than the fate of our tribe at stake. And none of it would have been possible without the will of the Ceo.

Ceo: The voyage was difficult. The wilds here, even more so. Our sailors and soldiers have suffered much. I know that. But all for the glory of the Quen.

Aloy: Good to know. What kind of machine has your people pinned down near Thebes?

Bohai: A Thunderjaw. We've dealt with them before, but this one is...

Aloy: Tougher, stronger and it has black armor?

Bohai: Yes. How did you know?

Aloy: Doesn't matter. Won't be easy, but I can take it down.

Ceo: Then destiny shines upon us, as I knew it would. A Living Ancestor now walks among us… ...and she will help me attain the secrets of Thebes.

Bohai: Resupply here if you must. Then, onto Thebes, at the base of the pyramid in the ruins. We will follow when our scouts confirm you've cleared the way.

[Aloy explores the settlement.]

Sonkai: So, it's true! A Living Ancestor walks among us! Please, speak with me! I didn't believe, but now I see. You truly are an Ancestor reborn. A good omen if I ever saw one. I'm a scout for the expedition. Whatever I learn of this strange land, I will share with you. As is my duty to the Ancestors. I should tell you then… My fellow scouts found ancient ruins west of here. They claim to have seen a relic of the Ancestors inside, but couldn't find a way to retrieve it. Perhaps a Living Ancestor could discover a way where others could not.

Aloy: Maybe. If I find myself in the area.

Sonkai: May the Ancestors guide us.

Aloy: Okay. Off to the big pyramid to fight the Thunderjaw. Gotta brace myself against this wind.

[She goe to Thebes to fight the Thunderjaw.]

Quen Marine: Run, stranger! There's a killer machine about!

Quen Guard: The machine will kill you!

Aloy: There you are. I guess we're doing this. Whoa, nice! Bet I could use that! I'm winded. I need to get my stamina back. I can keep going. Got it!

[She defeats the Apex Thunderjaw.]

Quen Guard: You killed that machine!

Aloy: Your Ceo sent me. I need to speak to Alva.

Quen Marine: By all means, then. Open the gates! Come on over, you! A word!

Alva: Aloy! Over here!

Aloy: Alva. I'm glad you're okay.

Alva: You got rid of that machine! But what are you doing here?

Aloy: There's something inside Thebes that I need. I went to Landfall Met your Ceo. We came to an agreement, kind of.

Alva: And you're going to help us get in?

Aloy: I guess so. The whole thing was a little tense. There's something off about that guy. And I don't understand what he wants from Thebes. I thought we found the data that your people needed back on the mainland.

Alva: That data will take us years to sift through. The Ceo wants faster results. Aloy, you have to be careful He's--

[Suddenly Ceo and Bohai appear with some guards.]

Bohai: There they are! The Legacy tells us that Elisabet Sobeck helped the Ancestors cast aside all obstacles! And so it has been today

Ceo: You have been true to your word. I am pleased. Thebes awaits us below. Shall we?

[They enter the digsite.]

Aloy: Quite an excavation.

Bohai: Much of this was flooded. We had to pump a great deal of water out. Behold. The door to Thebes.

Ceo: A door like no other.

Aloy: Well, you're right about that. It's designed to open for only one man - Ted Faro.

Ceo: But the Legacy tells us that he worked closely with Sobeck. He trusted her. Surely she could open the door. And so, surely, can you.

Aloy: Not gonna happen. At least not from this side.

Ceo: (to Bohai, threateningly) You said she was a Living Ancestor with Sobeck's eternal essence!

Alva: If I may? Faro, great as he was, did not build his palace alone. We know this from scraps of data we found, the ones that pointed to this location. And we found evidence of passages below. Maybe they were built to aid construction. Or, for servants. We can't reach them - the way is flooded and they're too far underwater. But...

Aloy: Yeah, I can reach them There might be another way in down there.

Bohai: You see? With Sobeck, there is always a way.

Ceo: Then do what you must to get us inside.

[Aloy jumps into underground water.]

Aloy: This water's... warm. It's almost like a hot spring. Look at that thing. It's huge. And it goes all the way down to the bottom. There's a rupture up there. Maybe a way in? Yeah. This could get me inside. Okay. Looks like this tunnel leads deeper into the structure. I'm going to have to find a way to stop that turbine from spinning to get past it. There's got to be a way to stop that turbine around here somewhere. Stopped the turbine. Good. 

[She gets out of the water.]

Aloy: Okay. I'm inside. But how do I let the Quen in? It looks like an... exercise room? A living area. It's pretty big, too. Let's hope this is the way to the main door, so I can let the Quen in. Look at this place. It's pretty fancy for a survival bunker. There. The door. Let's hope I can open it from the inside.

[She touches the panel near the door.]

Synthetic Voice: Emergency exit initiated.

Bohai: The door is open! Destiny is upon us! I knew you could do it!

Aloy: What's going on?

Bohai: The Ceo is preparing to enter Thebes.

Aloy: Oh. Why are you dressed Like Ted Faro?

Ceo: I am Faro, renewed. My essence is the same as his, across the years, across the generations. His soul is my soul. His will is my will. We are sundered in only one way. I need his final testament. His deepest secrets. And now that the door is open, those secrets are within my grasp. When I have them, I will be complete, as he was. I will have everything I need to save our homeland. And, as Faro did, the world.

Aloy: Okay. I think there's some confusion here, about who Faro really was...

Ceo: No one knows better than I who he was. Who he is. Me. The Renewer. Greatest of the Ancestors. The man who saved the world. And you. You understand Sobeck. You are her. Faro's harbinger. His assistant. Come. We will descend into Thebes together. As it should be. Bring her the raiment.

Aloy: Raiment?

Bohai: As he is Faro, you are Sobeck. For an occasion this momentous, shouldn't you wear proper business attire?

Aloy: Whoa... No no no no no. No. I am not wearing that. No way.

Ceo: You will wear the proper attire to mark this moment.

Aloy: Or what?

[The guards raise their bows.]

Ceo: It is said Sobeck valued life above all else. Is this true?

Aloy: Fine. I'll wear your "raiment."

[She changes her clothes to something resemble Elizabeth’s.]

Ceo: Excellent. Shall we proceed? Look at this place. The grandeur!

Bohai: Faro's domain. Simply breathtaking.

Ceo: Excellent. Somewhere in here, Faro left his secrets. Let's go find them.

Bohai: Your magnificence, perhaps we should leave guards behind to cover our exits?

Ceo: Indeed. Let it be done.

Bohai: To think, all this... preserved for the ages.

Ceo: As destiny intended for me. 

[They enter a wast room with a statue of Ted Faro in the center 30 feet or 10 meters tall I guess.]

Ceo: Faro's visage - a monument to greatness!

Bohai: Truly, my Ceo.

Aloy: It's a monument to something. I'll give you that.

Bohai: The Emperor will heap rewards upon you for this, my Ceo.

Ceo: Great risks bring great bounties. Overseer.

Aloy: I think this way might lead down.

Bohai: Quite a palace Faro built for himself.

Ceo: No less than he deserved.

Bohai: Wonder if Faro had a foot bath in here. I've always wanted one of those.

Ceo: There will be no further discussion of your feet, Bohai.

[Aloy speaks to Alva quietly and privately.]

Aloy: So hey, this is weird.

Alva: Yeah, I tried to warn you.

Aloy: Yeah, sort of.

Alva: I'll explain everything if we survive long enough!

Bohai: Those certainly look threatening.

Ceo: Statues. The guardians of Faro's domain.

[Aloy scans the statues and it’s just machines that turn on immediately.]

Aloy: Those aren't statues! Look out!

Ceo's Bodyguard: Get the Ceo out of here!

[Ceo and Bohai leave along with the guards.]

Aloy: Guess it's just us, then. They're riled up now.

[They fight the Corruptors.]

Ceo: Help the Diviner! The Diviner is down! Well struck! Not a bad hit! You got one!

Aloy: Still in this fight.

Ceo: Good hit! There. It is done. Well fought.

Aloy: Thanks.

Alva: Where's Overseer Bohai?

Ceo: So. No more delays. We must proceed. Yes. That look like the way. Ever deeper we go. 

[They enter a long hall with ]

Ceo: What is that? A reclining throne... attached to some kind of apparatus. I wonder what it does? An impressive set up. What is it for?

Alva: I'm sorry, Ceo. I don't know. My Focus can't read the data here.

Ceo: What about the Living Ancestor? Is the data lost to her? Scan the device, if you will. Please. Scan the device. Tell me what your Focus reveals about the device.

Hologram of Dr. Somptow: …made a minor adjustment to the gene therapy regimen and added a new cocktail to treat the symptoms caused by the mutations. Hopefully there will be some stabilization after the next treatment. God knows what Ted'll do to us if there isn't The early results were so promising. No signs of aging. No cellular degeneration. But now… If only I had access to my old lab in Bangkok. Or my old colleagues. Or my old liquor cabinet. Stop it. Got to stay positive. For Kanya.

Ceo: You saw something, I could tell. Did the data explain what Faro used this device for?

Aloy: I think he was undergoing treatments to live longer. A lot longer.

Alva: Really? Could he... still be alive?

Ceo: Don't be foolish. If he were alive, he would have kept his essence. It would not have been passed down to me. Remember - he was the Renewer. Of course he would have stopped at nothing to grasp the secrets of life and death. But not for himself. Everything he did was for a new beginning. For us - for the Quen. And for his true heir. Me.

Aloy: You know, I'm starting to think you're right. You do have a lot in common with Ted Faro.

Ceo: I knew you would see, in time. Let us continue. His secrets await! Hmm. Is that a small office? For a minor functionary, perhaps? Look at all this equipment. We are getting closer to the heart of this place. I can feel it. Break the door down.

Aloy: I'm going to look for another way in.

Alva: Good idea. It's worked before.

Ceo: Very well. Get to it.

Aloy: It's not hooking on to that.

Ceo: Hurry. Break it open. She's gone. Did she make it to the other side?

Aloy: A console. Maybe I can access Ted's files from here.

[She finds and downloads Omega Clearance to her Focus.]

Aloy: There. Omega Clearance. Got it. What do you have to say for yourself, Ted?

Ted Faro: (audio diary) Somptow's dead, along with his kid. Found them on the floor of his office this morning, holding hands. Must have poisoned themselves. I never would have put them to sleep! She was just a girl, for Christ's sake! I offered them life. And this is how they repaid me. By leaving me all alone. But I guess I've been alone since this whole thing began. Alone in bearing the burden. For the past. For the future.

Aloy: Same old Ted. No matter who dies, he's the one feeling sorry for himself.

Ted Faro: (audio diary) Lis' future. Lis' children. Someday they'll come. And I'll be here to greet them. Somptow said my aging has stopped altogether. If anything, my cells are replenishing faster than normal. I just need some time for the mutations to calm down. Time. And energy. Somptow said the reactor can give me what I need… ...to grow strong again. To get my shit back together. So I can greet the kids. They're gonna need me. My advice. My guidance. And then I won't be alone anymore.

[Ceo’s guards finally break the door.]

Ceo: Faro's secrets - are they here?

Aloy: Not the ones you're looking for.

Ceo: Then they must be in there.

Aloy: Trust me - you don't want to go in there.

[He nods to a door in the distance.]

Ceo: Are you mad? I haven't come all this way to stop now. 

[He approaches the door.]

Ceo: At last. Faro's legacy is mine.

[He goes inside. From afar, the eerie sounds of a monster can be heard.]

Ceo: Is that...?

Aloy: It's him.

Ceo: Burn it to ash.

Aloy: Wait! No! Faro has it rigged to melt down if--

Ceo: Kill them, too. No witnesses.

[Now Aloy and Alva tunt to enemies. Ceo’s guards attack them. The whole place is on fire.]

Aloy: Faro rigged the reactor to overflow if he dies. We have to run!

Alva: There's so much smoke! The whole place is shaking! Run! I can barely breathe. More soldiers up ahead!

Aloy: These guys are done. Get moving!

Quen Guard: Hurry, sire!

Aloy: Come on!

[Trying to escape, Ceo pushes the guard away.]

Ceo: Out of my way!

[He runs across the statue of Faro hoping to get out, but suddenly the statue breaks at the neck and Seo falls. The broken head of the statue flattens him. Aloy wrinkles.]

Alva: Ugh. Not a pleasant way to die.

Aloy: Soldiers! Above us! Don't stop, come on! Were almost there! We're close now! Come on! 

[Aloy and Alva, coughing, escapes the deathtrap.]

Aloy: Are you okay?

Bohai: What happened?

Aloy: We, uh... we found something that will help. Not just your homeland, but everywhere.

Bohai: But where's the Ceo?

Alva: He's... gone. I guess you could say he gave his life to help us attain the secrets of Thebes.

Bohai: I see. You must think I'm eminently stupid.

Alva: What? No. No!

Bohai: The Ceo was an entitled egotist who twisted our beliefs into a sickening, self-serving fantasy. And you expect me to believe he sacrificed himself for scraps of data? It's time for the truth, and it better be convincing. Otherwise, I'll simply order these soldiers to open fire.

Aloy: Hold on You're right. To be honest, the Ceo screwed everything up. He brought Thebes down around our ears and died like a gutless coward. But... we really did find something down there that will help your homeland… if I can take it and use it. Now, if I have to, I will fight my way out of here. But it doesn't have to be that way. You can just let me go… ...and then take credit when things start to improve.

Bohai: Success certainly does sound better than failure. It seems, then that our destinies are intertwined. Landfall is open to you. If it will help your cause you may come and go as you please. But... Alva must join you and report back on your efforts.

Aloy: Fair enough.

Bohai: Thebes is of no further value to us, obviously. We're going back to the flotilla. Alva - I expect your reports to be thorough.

[He leaves with the guards.]

Alva: I thought he was going to have us killed. And instead, I get to join you!

Aloy: Glad to have you. But you're going to need a little help to reach our base. (via Focus) Varl - I made a new friend. I need you to meet her at the Quen ferry and escort her back.

Varl: (via Focus) On it. Can't wait to meet her.

Aloy: Trust me, you'll love it there. Varl will give you a better Focus - and all the data you could ever want. Head to the ferry. I'll join you back east as soon as I can.

Alva: A Diviner must follow the truth, wherever it leads. I'll see you there.

[“FARO’S TOMB” completed.]

GEMINI
Aloy: Now that I have Omega Clearance, we should have what we need to capture HEPHAESTUS. But before I head to the ferry maybe I should stop by Landfall. With the Ceo gone maybe more Quen will be willing to talk. Might be worth looking around the island, too. I gotta change out of these clothes. I can't believe the Ceo made me play dress-up.

[Aloy returns to the base.]

Aloy: Felt cold enough for snow.

Zo: If you keep frowning that hard, you'll get wrinkles.

Varl: I just don't get this last part

Zo: Maybe we can look at it together later. Have a conversation about it.

Varl: I'd like that. 

[Aloy approaches.]

Varl: From the look on your face, I'd say the mission was a success?

Aloy: I got Omega Clearance. Is everyone ready to head out to Cauldron GEMINI?

Varl: As soon as you give the word.

Aloy: Did Alva make it here all right?

Varl: Our new Quen friend? The moment she laid eyes on the archives, she jumped on them like a Longleg.

Aloy: Sounds about right. Once GAIA is back up and running I expect you to put all your training to good use.

Varl: The seeds have been planted. All they need is a chance to bloom. What? I thought that was pretty good. Zo liked it.

Aloy: I'm glad you and Zo found each other.

Varl: Don't forget you're to blame for that.

Aloy: Now that I have Omega Clearance, we can grab HEPHAESTUS and finally have the advantage over the Zeniths.

Varl: Can't wait to see their faces as they stare down a bunch of charging Thunderjaws.

Aloy: Better them than us. For once. I should go get this to GAIA.

Varl: Of course. Let us know when we're needed.

Zo: Welcome back.

Aloy: Good to be back. Have you met our new Quen guest yet?

Zo: I could barely keep up as she gave herself a tour of the base. Varl gave her a new Focus. Though, when he told her she was free to access all the data we had here, she turned so pale I thought she'd faint on the spot. We showed her to the archive room so she could see for herself. She hasn't left the place since.

Aloy: Sounds like Alva. Read anything interesting lately?

Zo: I found out the Old Ones used leaf infusions like the Utaru do. Tea, they call it. Apparently it helped soothe them. That, and some sort of scented wax they used to "cleanse their aura." Plus something called "bubble baths." Me, I think I'll stick to singing to calm the nerves.

Aloy: How are things with everyone?

Zo: Slightly quieter. Erend's been busy scouring data on his newest obsession. Apparently the Old Ones wrestled machines as some kind of performance. Called it "Metal vs. Meat" A must-see battle between steel and flesh as Erend likes to put it. You'd think we have enough of that going around as it is.

Aloy: I need to get going.

Zo: Right You've retrieved the "Omega Clearance." That means we'll be going after HEPHEASTUS soon. I'll make sure my gear's ready.

[Aloy talks to Erend.]

Erend: There she is. I hear you found Thebes. How was it?

Aloy: Maniacs. Lava. What's not to like?

Erend: I'll remember that next time I go traveling.

Aloy: At least I got what we needed to trap HEPHAESTUS.

Erend: Good thing I've got my gear ready, then.

Aloy: You look tired.

Erend: Ha. You're never one to hold back, are you? I've just been making sure that I've got everything down for this mission of yours. Wouldn't want to be the usual screw-up out there.

Aloy: You'll do fine, Erend. Have you spoken with Alva yet?

Erend: When she's not reading the archives like a giddy kid drinking her first ale. She took to that new Focus quick, that's for sure. I gotta say, I'm a little jealous. But I can see why you two hit it off.

Aloy: I should get going.

Erend: As soon as you want us heading out to those Cauldrons...

Aloy: I'll give you the heads up.

[She goes to Alva.]

Alva: Aloy!

Aloy: Right to work, I see.

Alva: There's just.. So much! I mean, we knew of artificial beings that served the Ancestors, but GAIA? She's amazing! And you! A true reincarnation of an Ancestor! Genetically speaking, of course - not like the, um, late Ceo. And there's more Ancestors out there - returned from beyond the stars..! Of course, they're trying to kill us which is not great… and Erik Visser is with them, which is disturbing. And then there's HEPHAESTUS and--

Aloy: Okay, okay. How about… ...we take it one step at a time?

Alva: You're right. I also owe you an explanation for everything that happened, at Landfall.

Aloy: I see you've been using your new Focus.

Alva: It's been fascinating. So much better than the version the Quen have! What would have taken me years to sort through, like the database you helped me recover… ...with this, I've been able to establish search parameters to speed up the process. This could revolutionize how Diviners analyze the Legacy! That is whatever part of it the Overseers would actually let us study.

Aloy: You wanted data, you'll find lots of it here.

Alva: A Diviner has never had this sort of unsupervised access to archives such as this. And knowing you, I suspect there is much that would normally be Forbidden held within them. But I was sent here to help you. I would be remiss to ignore any truth laid before me. Maybe it'll help the Quen find their way back to the path of truth.

Aloy: You mentioned Erik Visser. How do you know about him?

Alva: The Zenith who tried to kill you? He is known to the Quen as The Protector. Combing through data related to his work led us to breakthroughs related to weapons and military tactics. Knowledge our rulers used to conquer and expand. To become the Empire we are today. That's why he's one of our most revered Ancestors. But based on your encounter with him, it appears he's even more ruthless than we ever imagined. Yet another distorted interpretation in the Legacy.

Aloy: Well, at least you're piecing together the truth.

Alva: If only the Overseers back home would do the same.

Aloy: Beta mentioned other Zeniths: Tilda, Verbena, and Gerard.

Alva: I'm afraid I don't know anything about them. Whatever Legacy they left behind, the Diviners haven't recovered.

Aloy: I imagine you don't know anyone here that well yet, but... they're a good group

Alva: It's funny, because one of your friends is, well, another you. Not that you are the same person, at all. I mean--you are-- as in-- you're both genetically Elisabet Sobeck-- But even so, you're different.

Aloy: Yeah. We are. I hope everyone's been treating you okay?

Alva: Oh. Yeah. Of course. They've all been extremely welcoming. And they share the knowledge they learn on their focuses with each other freely. It's refreshing. Back home, Diviners can only share data with the permission from the Overseers.

Aloy: Sounds restrictive. And stifling.

Alva: You are not wrong.

Aloy: You said you owed me an explanation for what happened in Thebes. I'm listening.

Alva: Right. I'll start at the beginning with the Ceo. He was an Imperial - the Emperor's nephew, in fact. As such, he sponsored many Diviners to search the Legacy for anything that might help the tribe. And himself. He took a special interest in anything related to Ted Faro, whom we consider the greatest of the Ancestors.

Aloy: Ted Faro, revered Ancestor. That's tough to take.

Alva: l know better now, of course. Anyway, the Diviners discovered that Faro spent a great deal of time in San Francisco. In fact, many of the most important Ancestors did. So the Emperor's nephew convinced him that an expedition across the ocean might solve our most pressing problems. If only we could find the right data in this fabled city. If only we could find the right data in this fabled city… ...perhaps we could roll back the floods and storms that threatened our people. The Emperor declared that all the tribe's resources be poured into this endeavor. Dozens of ships were built. Scouting missions were dispatched. And the Emperor's nephew was named Ceo, one who wields the Legacy for the good of the Empire. The living embodiment of Ted Faro, the Renewer. It may seem strange now, but for a time, he carried all of our hopes. We really believed he would save us. We had no idea just how perilous the journey would be.

Aloy: You said the expedition across the sea was more dangerous than you thought it would be. What happened?

Alva: We lost most of our ships to hurricanes, and scores of soldiers perished to hunger and disease. And that was before we even hit the coast. Once we landed, machines ripped our patrols apart. And we struggled to replenish our rations. There were bright spots, to be sure. We found Thebes and the Greenhouse. But nothing improved the Ceo's mood as his dreams of saving the tribe were slowly dashed. He became more and more obsessed with Thebes and what lay behind its door… and more and more convinced that the title of Ceo was no mere honorific. You heard him. Spouting nonsense about Faro's "essence" and some kind of “becoming.” We knew these weren't the words of a sane man. But he was quick to put any who spoke out in front of a firing squad.

Aloy: What a great guy.

Alva: The Quen are wrong about many things when it comes to the Legacy. I can see that now. But what the Ceo “became” was a complete perversion of what principled Diviners stand for - the pursuit of truth. I'm sorry you had to endure his madness. I'm just glad it's over. For everyone.

Aloy: So... Bohai, your Overseer. Will he run things better than Ceo?

Alva: He won't execute people on a whim, if that's what you mean. But he's hardly a paragon of integrity. I can't tell you how many times he took credit for data in the Legacy that I uncovered. The best thing I can say about him is that he can be trusted… to always do what's best for him

Aloy: Yeah. Sounds about right. Back at the Greenhouse, you spoke of knowledge forbidden to your people.

Alva: Diviners are meant to seek out the truth in the Legacy. And many Imperials sponsor them in the hopes they'll find something the Empire can put to use, thus gaining favor with the Emperor. But the Board of Overseers claims certain truths are… detrimental to the stability of the Empire. Like discovering one of our revered Ancestors ended the world. That is why Diviners are only allowed to access segments of the Legacy. Only Overseers can view it all. It ensures that any heretical data can be contained and retrieved before it can spread.

Aloy: What happens to Diviners who break the rules?

Alva: I never had the courage to ask.

Aloy: The "Ancestors." Is that what your people call the Old Ones?

Alva: Yes and no. The Ancestors are the greatest of the Old Ones. Those whose Legacy taught us agriculture, medicine, warfare, leadership. and patronage of the science and arts.

Aloy: The Ceo called Elisabet Sobeck an "Assistant." What's that about?

Alva: Right. Well… any Old One who has made minor contributions or worked extensively under one of the Ancestors is called an Assistant. That's how we thought of Sobeck. Until we met you. Our limited access to data past the late 2040s has obviously… misinformed our view of the past.

Aloy: You mentioned the reason you came here was to help your family, your sister--

Alva: Her name is Elika. Our parents are commoners. Peasants, really. When I passed the Divination exams they were so proud. It brought honor to our family and increased rations. Only Elika begged me not to leave for the Research Academy.

Aloy: Why? What happens there?

Alva: Elika knew that once you enter you're not allowed to leave or see anyone - not even your family. Unless you can get special permission and an escort by an Overseer.

Aloy: Sounds harsh.

Alva: Like the focuses we keep, Diviners are few in number and the Empire is… well, fearful that outsiders will try to steal our knowledge. Last time I was allowed to see my family was just before our voyage here. Because of my position, I was able to get them refuge from the floods within the capital. But if our crops don't recover soon, they'll starve to death along with everyone else.

Aloy: I promise I'll do my best to make sure it doesn't come to that. I need to get going but if you need anything--

Alva: All I need is to help you succeed in your mission. The plan GAIA told me about, to capture HEPHAESTUS… It will help set things right?

Aloy: I hope so.

Alva: Then I will do whatever I can. I promise.

[Aloy goes to Kotallo to ask about his new hand.]

Erend: (from afar) Is it me or do the Old Ones just look... funny?

Varl: (from afar) Funny how?

Erend: (from afar) Their clothes, they're… weird. So... tight

Zo: (from afar) For once, I'd have to agree. I'd rip those things to shreds in a fight.

Varl: (from afar) Guess they didn't move around as much.

Kotallo: Aloy. Well-met. We've been briefed on our mission and are ready whenever you wish to head to Cauldron GEMINI.

Aloy: Were you able to finish the new arm GAIA was helping you with?

Kotallo: Indeed. I was hoping we could discuss it, if you have a moment.

Aloy: You wanted to talk about your arm?

Kotallo: Indeed. It's time to test it. And I want you to be there.

Aloy: Okay. How are we doing this?

Kotallo: Not how. Where. Will you meet me where we felled Regalla's Tremortusk? Right where the river bends.

Aloy: Sure, if you want But I'm not sure I understand.

Kotallo: You'll see when we get there. I promise.

Aloy: Then I'll let you know when I get close.

Kotallo: You have my thanks, Aloy.

Aloy: How are your studies going?

Kotallo: I wanted to learn more about the world of the Old Ones.

Aloy: And?

Kotallo: I looked up this "Faro" GAIA said you went looking for… and learned about the plague of machines he unleashed. To think that the ancient world was wiped out by… a mistake. A single miscalculation. There is no glory or honor in such a fate. Only hubris. And pointless death. 

Aloy: That about sums it up. Have you spoken with Alva?

Kotallo: The Quen is peculiar. Nothing like a Tenakth. Her mind is sharp. That much is certain. But it's hard to imagine her surviving in the wilds.

Aloy: Trust me. She's tougher than she looks.

Kotallo: I will take your word for it.

Aloy: I have to go now.

Kotallo: Then do not let me keep you.

Aloy: Like I said, I'll call you when I'm close to Regalla's old outpost near the Bulwark.

Kotallo: May the Ten guide your way.

[Finally Aloy visits GAIA.]

GAIA: Welcome back.

Aloy: There we go. More data for the dome.

[She uploads the data and transforms the dome into a holographic forest.]

GAIA: I like this one. Aloy. I know your experience in Thebes was unseling, but we have a new problem.

Aloy: (sighs) Did something go wrong with Beta and the rig? Will we be able to transport you to GEMINI?

GAIA: The rig is complete. The problem is HEPHAESTUS itself. It has accelerated to proliferation throughout the Cauldron network, increasing its power.

Aloy: But with your sub-functions restored, we can still succeed, right?

GAIA: Corect. But the net effect is that absorbing HEPHAESTUS will take longer than previously calculated.

Aloy: How long?

GAIA: Even with Omega Clearance, my current estimate is that the merge will take 35 hours.

Aloy: And each hour increases the risk of detection by the Zeniths. Two cores. Two overrides? What if the merge were carried out by two clones of Elisabet Sobeck, both armed with Omega Clearance? How long then? Half the time?

GAIA: HEPHAESTUS would be unprepared for the simultaneous labor of two operators in addition to obvious synergetic efficiencies. Calculating…  It would reduce the merge time to approximately 4.5 hours.

Aloy: Okay. (via Focus) Varl. It looks like we're gonna need Beta at GEMINI. Do you think you can convince her?

Varl: (via Focus) Uh... I don't know, but I'll try.

Aloy: (to GAIA) What about our diversion? Are the pulse generators ready?

GAIA: Only a final test remains. I am content that if fired in proximity to other Cauldrons, the pulses will mask our activities at GEMINI from the Zeniths.

Aloy: Good. As long as Erend can operate one without shooting himself in the face.

Varl: (via Focus) Aloy, you'd better get down here. Beta's in bad shape.

Aloy: Okay.

Varl: Aloy. I tried, but it's impossible. I don't think anything will convince her to go.

Aloy: We don't have a choice.

Varl: Good luck.

[Aloy enters Beta’s room.]

Aloy: Beta, you have to come with us. It's the only way. It's one mission. The most important one. We need you.

[Beta just plays with some device and ignores Aloy.]

Aloy: Tell me why you won't go.

Beta: What if they - What if they take me back? Alone in a cell again. Their slave... forever.

Aloy: Varl and I will be at GEMINI, too. I'll protect you. As soon as we get HEPHAESTUS, we'll come straight back here. The Zeniths aren't going to find us. You don't have to be afraid.

Beta: (anxious) No! You can't protect me. Nothing can protect me from them! I told you from the beginning we'll never beat them! It's hopeless!

Aloy: Beta.

Beta: Leave me alone! You don't understand!

Aloy: You're right, I don't understand. We have the same genes. The same mind. So why can't you find the strength to do what has to be done? Like Elisabet would?

Beta: (in tears) Don't you think I've thought about that? I don't know what piece of Elisabet I'm missing. I don't know what you have that I don't. I looked through all the data from your Focus. You were raised as an outcast. Shunned and isolated just like me. So what's the difference? What's my defect?

[Aloy plays a hologram of Rost.]

Aloy: Beta, you don't have a defect. Beta look. It's not a piece of Elisabet. The difference is... I had him. Rost.

Beta: He raised you, trained you, but he was never warm or loving. The day he died - the day he gave you that charm - he was going to abandon you.

Aloy: He wanted me to embrace the tribe. But then he gave his life for mine. He loved me in his own way. And that was enough.

Beta: What did it feel like?

Aloy: It was like... having a strength that was always there. That's still there. Even now, I hear him in my head when things get bad. “When it looks impossible, look deeper. And then fight like you can win.” You don't have to go on the mission. We'll find another way.

Beta: I'll go. You said you'd try to protect me. I believe you. But you have to promise me one thing.

Aloy: Yes. Of course.

Beta: If it goes bad. If the Zeniths find us… I don't want to be their slave again. Do you understand?

Aloy: Okay.

Beta: Promise.

Aloy: I promise.

Beta: I could use as much time as you can give me to study up on the merge, to make it as efficient as possible. I'll be ready when you are. I swear.

GAIA: (via Focus) Aloy. Whenever you are ready, come speak to me and I'll ask the others to make final preparations for the mission.

Zo: The Old Ones fed off livestock a little too much for my liking.

Varl: Some of them ate more like the Utaru. Called themselves "vegetarians."

Erend: From what I'm reading, all the Old Ones wanted to eat was this stuff called chocolate.

Varl: Aloy. Everything okay with you and Beta? It sounded like you guys had a, uh, lively conversation.

Aloy: We just had a lot to talk about.

Varl: Does this mean she's coming with us to GEMINI?

Aloy: It does. I hope you’re ready to reign in the most stubborn Al of all time.

Varl: That's what all this was for, wasn't it?

Aloy: HEPHAESTUS won't go down quietly.

Varl: HEPHAESTUS is just a program that's lost its way. We are fighting for our survival. I can always call upon the Goddess if you're nervous.

Aloy: Funny. I hope firing off those pulse generators will be enough to distract the Zeniths.

Varl: It'll work. It has to.

Aloy: Always optimistic, huh?

Varl: Nah, just stubborn. It's a good quality to have when dealing with you.

Aloy: Yeah. Right. Any last findings you wanna share before leaving?

Varl: Not really. Though I've reached a decision.

Aloy: Oh?

Varl: When we put GAIA together, I want to return to the Nora. Spread what I've learned.

Aloy: You think they'll listen to you?

Varl: In time. I believe so.

Aloy: If anyone can make it happen, it's you, Varl. What will you and Zo do, if you go back to the Embrace?

Varl: I hope she'll come with me, at least for a while. And I'll go with her to Plainsong, too. She'll probably want to talk to her people about all this as well. We'll figure it out.

Aloy: I know you will. How does everyone seem to you?

Varl: Anxious, but ready. I heard Kotalo ask for Alva's help with his pulse generator. And I know he's been helping her with a few fighting techniques, just in case.

Aloy: I hope they aren't needed.

Varl: Like I said, just in case.

Aloy: You were right, you know. About keeping Rost's memories buried. I guess part of me thought he was holding me back because he wanted me to be a Nora. But the truth is, he gave me a lot. And took him for granted.

Varl: He was a good man. He raised you well.

Aloy: I'm glad you're coming with me, Varl.

Varl: Sure there's no urge to run off alone in there somewhere?

Aloy: No more running.

[Aloy walks to Erend.]

Aloy: Hey. I thought I'd check in before leaving for GEMINI.

Erend: You sure we shouldn't be checkin' up on you? Whatever went on between you and Beta sounded... intense. Not that I'm judging. Forge knows all the screws flew loose every time Ersa and I fought.

Aloy: I think we'll be fine from now on.

Erend: Glad to hear it.

Aloy: After we get HEPHAESTUS, we'll be taking the fight to the Zeniths. So, no more reading.

Erend: It wasn't that bad. Not really. Besides, going through all that “data” helped me realize something. The soldiers, the ones that fought the Faro machines so GAIA could be built. They were fighting a battle that couldn't be won. Not with all the weapons in the world. I think most of them realized that, whether anyone said it or not. They still did it, though. They bought time for all the eggheads working to save the future. Our future. As long as I can do that for you… I'll consider myself a success.

Aloy: Thank you, Erend. I'm glad you're with me.

Erend: Okay, enough. I'm gonna get emotional.

Aloy: Anybody take you up on that ale you brought yet?

Erend: Zo can't stand the smell of it. I tried Alva, but I don't think she knows what taking a break means. And I'm not putting Varl anywhere near that stuff after that victory party in Meridian.

Aloy: What about Kotallo?

Erend: Ah. Now there's a man that can hold his liquor. Pretty sure we downed half a keg. We had a good chat. I think.

Aloy: I should go.

Erend: Same here. I got a date with a Cauldron to prepare for.

[Aloy walks to Zo.]

Aloy: Hey. We'll be going after HEPHAESTUS soon. You good with the plan?

Zo: I've already got the location of my assigned Cauldron.

Aloy: Good.

Zo: I heard you and Beta had a… talk.

Aloy: News travels fast.

Zo: It wasn't exactly a quiet conversation.

Aloy: There were just things that needed to be said.

Zo: A healthy crop to those who clear the weeds between them, as the Utaru say.

Aloy: You look like you have something on your mind.

Zo: We're going to war soon. And war is something I promised myself I'd left behind in the Red Raids… But the more of your data l go through. Every voice I hear, every word read from our ancient past… It makes me realize just how much life was given so that ours could flourish. Fighting for that gift… It's our responsibility. If we fail, it was all for naught.

Aloy: Helps to know you're not alone.

Zo: For a moment there, you sounded like Varl.

Aloy: I don't know what you're talking about. I should go.

Zo: As soon as you intend to leave for GEMINI--

Aloy: You'll hear about it.

[She visits Alva.]

Forbidden Legacy (start)
Aloy: I hope I'm not interrupting.

Alva: Not at all. I was just studying the pulse generator schematics. The ones GAIA and Beta built The craftsmanship is remarkable. Is everything all right? It sounded like there was an... issue with Beta, and the mission?

Aloy: Not anymore. We just needed to talk some things through Alva. To understand one another is to embrace truth. Oh! And... if you have a moment, there's something I could use your help with.

Aloy: Any more data catch your eye?

Alva: All of it! I have so much to study up on. Years, actually. I'm particularly interested in the Odyssey. In fact, we theorized some of them had settled on it. But Sirius is WAY farther than that. And we thought journeying across the ocean would be the feat of a lifetime! The sheer calculations needed for space travel! It's overwhelming to think about!

Aloy: Even so, the Quen are way ahead of other tribes when it comes to understanding this stuff. Where I grew up, everyone thought that stars were sparks that rose from a fire lit by the Goddess to guide us through the night.

Aloy: Have you spoken with Zo at all?

Alva: A little bit. But… I did hear her singing with Varl not too long ago. I don't think they noticed. Zo seemed so... free when she did it. Like every emotion she had was taking flight in song. And she looked happier because of it. I felt so dull and nervous in comparison.

Aloy: You should ask Zo to teach you sometime. About Utaru music.

Alva: Maybe.

Aloy: If you need anything before heading out to the Cauldrons--

Alva: You have nothing to worry about. GAIA's explained your plan in detail. As expected from such an efficient AI. I've even received some very, um... succinct combat advice from Kotallo. You know... in case the Zeniths show up.

Aloy: What kind of advice?

Alva: He, uh, told me to run.

Aloy: For now. We'll even the odds soon enough. Must be strange to think that some of the Ancestors your tribe reveres are still alive. And here on Earth, right now.

Alva: It is. Part of me's curious to know who else besides Erik Visser might be among them. Maybe Nikhita Arand? We call her The Spark. The Legacy tells us she brought unlimited energy to the Old Ones. Or Song Jiao, whom we call The Healer. It is said she found new ways to extend the Ancestors' lifespans. But my curiosity fades when I think of how different our view of Visser was compared to the reality that you experienced. Perhaps it is better not to know.

Aloy: You mentioned there was something you needed help with?

Alva: Yes! So, as I was sifting through data from the Greenhouse, I found references to an Old World system back in the Great Delta. It's called Leviathan. My people discovered it decades ago - a sprawling network of river gates and a labyrinth of underground tunnels. The Legacy revealed that the Old Ones used it to control flooding… but we've never gotten it to work. The whole thing is shut down. But the data from the Greenhouse mentions the research facility where Leviathan was created. It's in San Francisco.

Aloy: Another Faro facility?

Alva: No. Leviathan was a project by Eileen Sasaki, another Ancestor… so the Legacy tells us, anyway. If we can acquire that data, we might be able to fix the system back in the Great Delta. Every year, my sister gets terrified when the long rains begin. With Leviathan, maybe she won't have to be.

Aloy: Okay, so where in San Francisco is this facility?

Alva: That's the thing. The data doesn't say where, exactly. But one of our Diviners has been exploring the ruins. He might know. Would you come with me? I have a feeling that wherever this facility is, well… You're much better at fighting machines than I am.

Aloy: Of course. I'll let you know when I'm in Landfall.

Alva: Thank you, Aloy.

Aloy: I should go. Make sure you talk to GAIA if you have any questions about the pulse generators.

Alva: May your path lead to truth.

Aloy: And like I said, I'll let you know when I'm in Landfall. We'll find the data you're after.

Alva: I appreciate it.

Varl: We just need to find the right strategy.

Erend: Forget it. The man is unbeatable at Machine Strike.

Kotallo: Hmm.

Zo: His people invented the game, what did you expect?

Kotallo: Aloy. Are you well?

Aloy: Had a bit of an issue with Beta. It's better now, though.

Kotallo: Ah. I'm not surprised.

Aloy: Really? Why not?

Kotallo: I once knew a warrior who discovered he had a brother late in life. It was deeply uncomfortable for him.

Aloy: Did he ever get over it?

Kotallo: In time. But not before the two siblings nearly killed each other in a single combat challenge.

Aloy: Ah. Well, at least I avoided that. Think you're ready to put all your training to the test?

Kotallo: I am Tenakth. I am always ready.

Aloy: You nervous about the mission ahead?

Kotallo: If I live it will be in victory. If I die it will be in battle. What matters most is that you achieve your objective.

Aloy: I'll do my best. I should go get ready.

Kotallo: I await your orders.

[Aloy returns to GAIA.]

GAIA: Hello again, Aloy. Hello, Aloy.

Aloy: Hey, GAIA. So, uh… me and Beta. I guess you heard what happened.

GAIA: Yes. I am continuously impressed by the complexity of human relationships. Despite the unpleasant circumstances that led to your quarrel. l am pleased to see you have been found an agreeable resolution.

Aloy: Well, two heads are better than one, right?

GAIA: Yes, I believe so. Are you ready to depart for Cauldron GEMINI? Or we can continue our conversation if you like.

Aloy: The missing subordinate functions. What can you tell me about them?

GAIA: ARTEMIS re-wilded the Earth with a variety of animal species. ELEUTHIA was responsible for gestating, nurturing, and acculturating a new generation of human beings. APOLLO was tasked with preserving organizing… and disseminating vast archives of human knowledge and cultural achievements. Unfortunately, all archived APOLLO data was purged on the 2nd of February 2065 by order of Ted Faro.

Aloy: Ted. Guess he got what he deserved in the end.

GAIA: Yes. An igneous conclusion to his pathological narcissism, impulsive tendencies and instability.

Aloy: All three of the missing functions have already served their purpose - or were prevented from doing so. Do you still need them?

GAIA: Restoring their remaining elements would increase my heuristic processing density, empowering my overall function. Unfortunately, as we now know they are in the possession of Far Zenith, attaining them in the short-term is very likely impossible.

Aloy: I guess our best shot at recovering them is by taking over the Zenith base. But we'll need HEPHAESTUS and a bunch of combat machines to do that.

GAIA: Correct.

Aloy: So, about Beta... I never really saw the difference between us until now. She's been through so much, completely alone.

GAIA: You have both endured many hardships. Different in almost every respect, yet equally remarkable. I like to think of you as two miracles, born of Elisabet Sobeck.

Aloy: Three, then. Let's not forget about you, GAIA. How's Alva settling in?

GAIA: As soon as she arrived, Alva was eager to study the data in the archive. A particular file soon caught her attention - information about a machine assistant devoted to keeping living spaces neat and orderly. I informed her that once I am empowered with the abilities of HEPHAESTUS, I may be able to design such a machine.

Aloy: (smirks) I'm sure she'll like that. When I set out to find a way to bring you back… I never thought we'd be here like this - among friends.

GAIA: They have all come a long way with their improvised educations. Varl has suggested that one day we might extend this model to more tribal inhabitants, once the biosphere has been stabilized.

Aloy: Veah, that's not such a bad idea. As long as you're the one running the lessons. So our plan to capture HEPHAESTUS. Let's go over it again.

GAIA: As you wish thanks to Beta’s test, we now know that HEPHAESTUS will not respond to your Alpha Clearance.

Aloy: Which is why I got Ted Faro's Omega Clearance.

GAIA: Correct. While you were gone, Beta constructed the transport rig and pulse generators When we get to GEMINI I will need to be installed on one of the facility’s cores. The second core is for HEPHAESTUS. Using Omega Clearance will allow you to trap it.

Aloy: And then you'll be able to absorb it.

GAIA: Not quite. You will need to manually remove HEPHAESTUS' malicious code before the merge.

Aloy: How long will that take?

GAIA: Because the work will be split between you and Beta, it will take approximately 4,5 hours.

Aloy: And during that time, the others will create a distraction for us using the pulse generators, right?

GAIA: Correct. They will each take position at a Cauldron door and fire off their device. The energy surge should mask our activities until the merge is complete.

Aloy: And then we'll have everything we need to defeat the Zeniths. Sounds like a plan. So I found Thebes. What do you think Ted would've done if his life-extension treatments had worked?

GAIA: It seems he convinced himself it was his duty to guide future humans. Given the tribal nature of new humans and his ability to use Omega Clearance on the terraforming system. I imagine he would have convinced one or more tribes to worship him as their patriarchal deity.

Aloy: O-okay. Yep, glad that didn't happen. Aside from GAIA Prime and Thebes there was one other underground facility that was sealed before the Fara Plague reached. Elysium. The place where Zero Dawn staff and their families went to live out their lives. Do you know what happened to it?

GAIA: Elysium was designed to provide life support for one hundred years. My data indicates the facility went offline well before then.

Aloy: Did the Faro Plague find them?

GAIA: Unknown. My connection to the facility was abruptly severed.

Aloy: So, what will happen to this place while we're at GEMINI?

GAIA: All systems within this facility will continue to operate. As MINERVA will no longer be maskmg lihis location, the facility will be exposed to detection. Though without my presence, it is unlikely to attract attention.

Aloy: Let's hope so. (via Focus) Okay, people. It's time to head out.

Varl: (via Focus) I'll get everyone together.

[And so the mission begins! They ride on Chargers to GEMINI. Erend, Kotallo, Alva and Zo take their paths. Aloy, Beta and Varl arrive at GEMINI to set up GAIA. Soon all the cables are connected…]

Beta: All right Connections in place. Booting up...

GAIA: Beta, Aloy. I am fully installed on this core and ready to connect to the Cauldron network.

Aloy: It's good to hear your voice. (via Focus) Erend - everyone. Fire your pulses and sound off.

[Holographic image of Erend, Kotallo, Alva and Zo appears as if they stand right next to Aloy.]

Erend: (via Focus) I'm at my Cauldron. This thingy… it's blinking. Did I do it right?

Kotallo: (via Focus) In position at my Cauldron. My pulse generator is blinking, also.

Alva: (via Focus) That means they're working. I'm in position and mine is, too.

Zo: (via Focus) Mine, as well.

Aloy: (via Focus) Okay. Radio silence until I give the all clear. Signing off. GAIA - Let's cage the beast.

GAIA: Connecting to the Cauldron network now.

Aloy: Elisabet Sobeck, Alpha Prime - activating Omega Clearance.

Beta: Elisabet Sobeck, Alpha Prime - activating Omega Clearance.

[And Varl is just standing there trying to look smart.]

GAIA: Clearance confirmed. Initiating containment sequence,

HEPHAESTUS: Critical threat detected. Imperative: Escape containment. Applying countermeasures.

[It turns on the high-frequency noise immobilizing the characters.]

Aloy: Lock it down!

GAIA: Terminating external connections.

Aloy: It's working! It's got nowhere to go!

HEPHAESTUS: Capture imminent. Initiating Contingency 13-F.

Beta: Wait - what's that???

GAIA: Malware detected. Attempting to compensate.

HEPHAESTUS: Containment... unacceptable.

Aloy: It's cracked!

Varl: Look!

HEPHAESTUS: Facility activated. Engaging autonomous defenses. Directive: Neutralize. Directive: Neutralize. 

Aloy: That means machines are on their way! Get ready!

Varl: Here they come! Varl, stay here. Protect Beta.

[She starts fighting some heavy machines.]

Beta: Be careful!

Varl: Stay back!

Beta: Aloy! Help!

Varl: Get back!

Beta: Ahh!

Varl: Over here, you!

Beta: It'll be okay, it'll be okay...

Varl: Aloy! Need a hand over here!

Beta: It's really angry!

Varl: Draw it away from Beta!

Beta: Go away!

Varl: Stay back!

Beta: Aloy! Help!

Varl: Get back!

Beta: Ahh!

Varl: Over here, you!

Beta: It'll be okay, it'll be okay...

Aloy: That's all of them for now. For the next fight. Are you two okay?

Varl: Still breathing!

Beta: Aloy - HEPHAESTUS can't escape, but it must've fled...

Aloy: Deeper into the facility. I'll drive it back here. Deeper into the facility. I'll drive it back here.

Beta: I'll get the cracked core fixed in the meantime!

Aloy: Keep her safe, Varl. Okay, I gotta chase after HEPHAESTUS, force it out of wherever it's hiding. Make it retreat to the core.

HEPHAESTUS: Deactivate Connection Node 18-3.

Aloy: Oh no you don't, HEPHAESTUS. I'll find another way over.

Beta: (via Focus) Aloy, I'm patched in to your Focus feed. You should know there's a huge power draw coming from the next chamber.

Aloy: Thanks for the heads up. I'm almost there. It's some kind of production chamber. HEPHAESTUS is up to something, all right.

Beta: (via Focus) What kind of machine is it trying to build?

Aloy: I don't know, but I'm going to shut it down. I bet those metal carriers will lead me to where it's getting materials from.

Beta: (via Focus) Bet that's where HEPHAESTUS is hiding too.

Aloy: I gotta find where HEPHAESTUS is hiding. Looks like there are a couple of ways I could go.

HEPHAESTUS: Deploy Autonomous Defenses to Materials Bay.

Aloy: Well, that doesn't sound good.

Beta: (via Focus) Aloy, I've managed to rewire most of the components in the core, but the energy processor's cracked. Without a way to fabricate another, there's no way I can fix it.

Aloy: Okay. Let me think. What if you bypass the processor? Connect it to...

Beta: (via Focus) The power node! I think that could work!

Aloy: I think it could. I can get into that chamber if I go over the shield. Just a little longer… Okay. Now how to drive HEPHAESTUS out of here?

Beta: (via Focus) There should be a node you can override, near the central platform.

Aloy: Thanks. But maybe I should deal with these machines first. 

[She jumps off a moving platform carrying materials and engages in a battle with the machines.]

Aloy: Now's my chance!

HEPHAESTUS: Activating countermeasures. Deploying secondary defenses. Intruder your culling is at hand.

Aloy: Oh, great. More machines on the way. Beta, HEPHAESTUS has locked me out of the node. Any ideas?

Beta: (via Focus) I’ll see what I can do!

[She continues to fight.]

Aloy: Machine's seizing up! There! I got them all.

Beta: (via Focus) I tapped into the core's network hub and managed to disrupt HEPHAESTUS'S control of the node. You should be able to override it now.

Aloy: Nice! Thanks.

HEPHAESTUS: Parge imminent. Retreating to Materials Bay Castor-11.

Beta: (via Focus) It sounds like it fled to another chamber.

Aloy: Well, it better not get comfortable.

HEPHAESTUS: Energy Containment Poll Safes Overridden.

Aloy: Great HEPHAESTUS covered the floor with lightning. I gotta find a way over it.

Varl: (via Focus) Aloy? More machines keep coming. Please tell me you're getting close?

Aloy: I'm working on it. I've been smashing through a lot of machines on my side, too.

Varl: (via Focus) I guess Erend's missing out!

Beta: (via Focus) Aloy. I'm making progress on the bypass, but I need something to hold the cycling module together.

Aloy: Maybe a ligament from one of the machine carcasses?

Beta: (via Focus) Right! Or some luminous braiding.

Aloy: And you could reinforce it with a conversion cylinder...

Beta: (via Focus) For increased connectivity! I think… I think we can do this, Aloy!

Aloy: (to herself) There has to be a way to get past this shield. I can get into that chamber if I go over the shield. All right. I need to drive HEPHAESTUS out of here.

Beta: (via Focus) There should be another node to override.

Aloy: Got it. Cold as a glacier! This cloud should hide me for a while. Not enough stamina for that. Got enough stamina for that.

HEPHAESTUS: Intruder detected. Activating Countermeasure ZX-Giga-9. Autonomous defenses deployed.

Aloy: Oh, here we go again...

Beta: (via Focus) That doesn't sound good! I'll try to get your access back.

[Aloy has to fight again.]

Aloy: That's all of them

Beta: (via Focus) And… there! Node access restored. Now you can override it.

Aloy: Good work.

Beta: (via Focus) You did the heavy lifting.

HEPHAESTUS: Purge imminent. Retreating to Construction Bay 1.

Aloy: Okay. HEPHAESTUS is running out of places to hide.

Beta: (via Focus) Uh... Aloy? I just registered a huge energy surge back in the production chamber. Something big is happening.

Varl: (via Focus) Here, too. Everything's glowing!

Aloy: That machine HEPHAESTUS was building it must've finished it.

Beta: (via Focus) Well, it's powerful, whatever it is. I'm almost done with the core repairs. Should... should we come to you? Maybe I could distract the machine, if..

Aloy: No, Beta. Just stay where you are, okay? Handling the machine's my job.

Beta: (via Focus) Okay. Be safe.

HEPHAESTUS: Intruder targeted. The one that captured Repair Cauldron TAU. You are a violation. But no more. Your interference will be terminated. Deploying priority unit S-Mark-1.

[HEPHAESTUS deploys a heavy, dinosaur looking machine. It roars and charges at Aloy.]

Aloy: I should scan it first. Those things on its legs are glowing. I think it's charging up. I could take out its tail. Stop some of its attacks. It finished charging! It's covered in Plasma! This Plasma's gonna explode in a second! Maybe one of my potions can help! Got its tail! And it dropped a heavy weapon! It's powering up! Just what I needed. Need a new strategy! Maybe Purgewater can dampen its attacks? 

[She manages to defeat the monster.]

Aloy: There. It's done.

Beta: (via Focus) You did it! There should be one more node to override.

Aloy: Good. Stand by. I'm sending HEPHAESTUS back to you. (outloud) No more hiding, HEPHAESTUS!

HEPHAESTUS: Purge imminent. Retreating to facility core.

Beta: (via Focus) Got it! HEPHAESTUS is back in the core!

Aloy: Make sure it stays there. I'm heading back.

Beta: (via Focus) And then we can start the merge!

Aloy: Because of you, Beta. I'm glad you came along. And you, Varl. We couldn't have done any of this without you. 

Varl: (via Focus) Right back at you, Aloy.

[Aloy reunites with her friends. “GEMINI” quest completed!]

Beta: (via Focus) Aloy! The bypass is done. The core is stable. HEPHAESTUS IS one hundred percent contained.

Aloy: Then we'd better get started with the merge. 

Beta: It's all set up. GAIA, establish the link, please.

GAIA: Done.

[GAIA releases a stream of violent energy from her mainframe and directs it to the core containing HEPHAESTUS.]

Beta: Okay. To complete the merge, we need to excise HEPHAESTUS's malicious code. Carefully.

[Beta and Aloy begin to operate the holographic interface simultaneously. Aloy repeats after Beta.]

Beta: Aloy, look.

[She creates a holographic image (a dove or an angel or something, can't make it out) and sends it to Aloy. She smiles and accepts the “message.” Suddenly the hatch above explodes and three Zenith flying in.]

Gerard: Well hello, redundant copy. You've cost us quite a lot of time.

[Aloy awkwardly draws the bowstring, but she’s thrown away by the laser shot. She seems to have suffered enough damage and can't get up. Varl takes out his bow.]

Gerard: Erik - get Beta. And squash that bug while you're at it.

[Varl shoots at a device hanging from the ceiling and it crushes Erik, though it doesn't stop him for long. Varl takes out his spear.]

Varl: Get behind me.

[Varl and Erik fight for a while without any success at Varl’s side.]

Gerard: Come on. Quit screwing around.

[Erik grabs Varl by the neck.]

Erik: Now we're having fun, right?

[He stabs Varl with the blade on his arm.]

Aloy: No!

Beta: Aloy!

[Erik grabs Beta. Aloy aims at Beta to kill her but in the end is unable to do so.]

Gerard: Finally. Tilda, get GAIA and HEPHAESTUS ready for transport. Tilda?

Aloy: I failed.

Tilda van der Meer: Hush. All is not lost.

[She emits a powerful stream of white light.]

Gerard: Tilda, what the hell are you doing? Stop her!

Erik: I can't even see her!

[Some time passes. Aloy comes to her senses in some other place.]

Aloy: Beta. (in tears) Varl. Where am I?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Ah, you're awake. You took quite a hit when Gerard attacked you. I imagine you must still be in a great deal of pain. I can assure you that we are safe. The others can't detect us here.

Aloy: You mean the other Zeniths. You must be Tilda.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) I wasn't sure if Beta would have told you about me.

Aloy: Where is she?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Alive, and while she isn't where she wants to be not in urgent danger. We must discuss how to get her back of course. After you've shaken off the cobwebs. When you're ready, take the stairs down the hall and come see me. In the meantime, I'll make breakfast.

[Aloy takes her bow and other equipment.]

Aloy: Breakfast? Okay.

Interlude: ALL THAT REMAINS
[Aloy leaves the room and explores the facility.]

Aloy: What is this?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Just a few favorites from my collection, rescued and stored here just before I went off-world. Take a look, if you like. I'm curious to hear your impressions.

Aloy: My friend is dead. Beta and GAIA are gone. And you want me to look at old paintings?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Don't be so quick to dismiss the comfort we can find in art. Or the insight we might gain. My favorite pairing. On the left is "Woman reading a letter" by Vermeer, a true master. And on the right is a forgery: "Woman reading Music," which fooled experts into believing it was a priceless original. Early in my career, I became fascinated with such deceptions. Eventually I developed scanning software that could detect fakes with unparalleled accuracy.

Aloy: Is that how you made enough money to buy your way onto the Odyssey?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Oh, no. I made my real fortune later. Selene and Endymion. She's the goddess of the moon, whereas he's a simple shepherd. Beside her is the god of love, Cupid.

Aloy: So, she's… sneaking up on him?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) More like visiting him in secret. The torch that Cupid bears represents Selene's undying infatuation with him. Though the two must remain apart, her love will forever burn.

Aloy: And why can't Selene and Endymion be together?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Selene took a vow of chastity, promising to never take a lover. So when she fell in love with Endymion, she could only visit him at night while he slept.

Aloy: But then wouldn't she be breaking that vow?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Think of it as a forbidden love. Though circumstance keeps them apart still they find a way to come together, however briefly.

Aloy: Aren't Selene and Endymion cold?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Perhaps we should move on to another piece.

Aloy: Why do you keep the forgery?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) I've always enjoyed studying the two side by side. Both painters capture light, color, and perspective, but what makes one a masterpiece and the other simply an imitation?

Aloy: The forgery looks… sharper.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Good eye. The details are crisp, the contrast bold. It tells us more, and yet we feel less.

Aloy: What's in the letter?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Who can say? What does the painting tell you?

Aloy: She's… concerned. Whatever's written in the letter troubles her. A burden she can't put down.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Fascinating.

Aloy: Why go through so much effort to make a fake masterpiece?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) The forger initially painted under his own name, but found little success.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) His work was considered unremarkable. But when he took on the guise of Vermeer suddenly it was celebrated as extraordinary.

Aloy: But it was a lie, and he knew it.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Sometimes we struggle to glean what is real and imagined even within ourselves. The irony of these two is that Vermeer died in obscurity. He had no idea his work would become some of the most precious, most copied, most preserved pieces in all history. This is Rembrandt, painting Jeremiah a man in mourning.

Aloy: Mourning what?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) His home, the ancient city of Jerusalem. He foresaw its impending doom but could do nothing to prevent it. So instead, he saved its treasures from destruction. just as I saved these works. You could say we're kindred spirits.

Aloy: About Jeremiah. If he knew his home would be destroyed, why didn't he save the people? Why save those relics?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) He tried, but no one would listen to his warnings - so he saved what he could.

Aloy: But how did he know?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) He was a prophet. He saw an army invade and destroy the city in a vision.

Aloy: So it's more like he calculated which side would win a battle?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) What matters is that he was right in the end. If not for him, all those wonders would've been lost forever. At least this way, some part of his world survived. You know what I like the most about this piece? Even though he's the sole survivor, his home in ruins, left with only the remnants of his world… the light keeps the shadows at bay.

Aloy: There's still hope.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Precisely. Take as long as you like. A portrait of the painter Rembrandt's son, Titus, depicted in the habit of a monk.

Aloy: I don't get it. Why would someone like you, with infinite resources, care about this painting of a boy in a hood?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) It's not the image itself, but the feeling it conveys. The face is bright and defined, but his eyes are downcast, heavy with misfortune. And the background seems to swallow all light. The painting is infused with a sense of loss.

Aloy: I guess I understand how the painter feels.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Works of art such as these can often cause us to look inwards, at our own lives. I'm sorry about your friend. Had I been able to intervene, I would have. But the risk of losing you as well was too great.

Aloy: Everything went by in a blur. I couldn't get to him.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) You know, long before holograms and Focus recordings, people relied on art to memorialize their loved ones. Because of works like this painting their lives are immortalized. Rembrandt had four children by his wife all but Titus died shortly after she gave birth to them. She passed not long after that. Titus became the only family Rembrandt had.

Aloy: Which is why he painted him this way?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Indeed. Then tragedy struck again. Disease claimed Titus at twenty-six. It's almost as if Rembrandt painted the future closing in on him. Rembrandt actually painted several portraits of Titus, but this one has always been my favorite. It’s honest.

Aloy: What do you mean?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) In others, Titus was portrayed in brighter, livelier states. But here, Rembrandt allows himself to express his true feelings. Sorrow, fear, hope, love. Laid bare on canvas for all time. I see this one resonates deeply with you. Rembrandt's "The Night Watch" - by far the most famous painting my homeland ever produced. It was commissioned to honor a militia made up of influential citizens.

Aloy: I guess you must have been an "influential citizen."

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) In my day. But not as influential as you've been in this new world.

Aloy: The militia - they look disorganized.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Where others painted such scenes in a stiff and stationary manner. He wanted them to feel alive. You can almost hear the commotion.

Aloy: Who's the girl in the painting?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) She's a strange one, isn't she? Bathed in light, though no one is paying attention to her. Many believe she's a symbol of the militia - a physical manifestation of their spirit, if you will.

Aloy: She's not real?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) What's real in a painting? She's meant to represent the militia's virtue and victory. But I like to think they underestimate her. She looks as if she's seen something. What does she know? What secrets does she keep? There's so much detail to take in, isn't there? “The Gust” by Willem van de Velde, the most famous of his many maritime paintings.

Aloy: A ship crossing into the unknown. I guess you're familiar with that.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Indeed. Which is why I appreciate this composition in particular. Though waves and wind threaten to destroy the ship it perseveres, clinging to the light even as darkness closes in all around it.

Aloy: Where's the ship going?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) To a faraway land, most likely. My ancestors used ships like these to explore the world, sometimes at great cost.

Aloy: What were they looking for?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Anything of value. They were traders - willing to face unknown dangers to make their fortunes. But no matter how far they went. they always turned their sails home.

Aloy: So this "van de Velde" only painted ships?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) It was his specialty, following in the footsteps of his father, Willem the Elder. The two had quite a journey of their own, taking them all the way to the court of a foreign kingdom.

Aloy: Did they ever come home?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) No. But eventually their life's work did. Take your time. Stunning, isn't it? Paintings weren't the only masterpieces of my people's heyday. This is van Vianen's lidded ewer, molded from a single sheet of silver.

Aloy: What was it for?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) How like Elisabet you are - function over form. Its practical purpose was less important than its meaning. Van Vianen created it in honor of his late brother, who himself was a famous silversmith.

Aloy: A memorial.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Yes. Such beauty from sorrow.

Aloy: If this ewer was a memorial, how did you end up with it?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) As the Faro swarm closed in, my homeland's greatest museum gave it to me.

Tilda van der Meer: along with many other works… …in the hope that I could preserve them. A masterpiece like this was too important to lose to history.

Aloy: Why didn't you?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) I took a calculated risk. This vault seemed more secure than the unknowns of space. Besides - I thought someday I might return. Along life, after all, has its advantages. Now, lo and behold, here I am. Exquisite, isn't it?

Aloy: (looking at the statue, presumably Atlas) A lot of weight on his shoulders. I know the feeling. I should move on. (looking at Frenzy by Artus Quellinus) She's pulling out her own hair. Out of madness? Out of grief? It's hard to watch her suffer. I should move on.

[Finally, Aloy climbs the high stairs and finds Tilda herself. She resides in a vast, overgrown place.]

Tilda van der Meer: There you are. Feeling better?

Aloy: How did you find us at the Cauldron? And what did you do to everyone right before I passed out?

Tilda van der Meer: All business, I see. Well, suffice it to say we were keeping a very close eye on HEPHAESTUS, knowing we would need it at some point. Your ruse didn't fool us. And as for my little trick… It was an overload of the senses, accompanied by an energy discharge. Gerard and Erik were only momentarily disoriented, due to their shields. But it - it rendered you unconscious while I got you out. Perhaps some breakfast might steady you a bit?

Aloy: This was your house - the one you recreated for Beta in the Data Channel you shared.

Tilda van der Meer: How perceptive of you. Please, this way.

Aloy: After everything your people have done… You thinkin just going to sit down and have a chat with you?

Tilda van der Meer: They're not my people. They never were - and especially not now.

Aloy: You shot off into space with them. And lived with them for a thousand years before coming back. So what made you suddenly turn on them?

Tilda van der Meer: Quite simply… this.

[She shows Aloy a Focus.]

Aloy: My old Focus. You repaired it… But that means you've seen.

Tilda van der Meer: Incredible things. What you've accomplished, in two decades of life? A thousand years at my back and I haven't even come close. I'm sorry I invaded your privacy, but I had to, in order to understand. To be enlightened. You truly are Elisabet's blood with her drive. Her sense of mission. Her integrity. Watching all this shamed me for  the company that I've kept. Having seen it all I want is to help you.

Aloy: Even if it means stopping your friends?

Tilda van der Meer: Especially so please. Sit down. 

[Aloy sits at the table to have breakfast with Tilda.]

Tilda van der Meer: There. That's better. Now… We must recover Beta and GAIA at all costs. By now you must know that Gerard intends to use GAIA to reboot the Earth's biosphere… (sips some tea) remaking this world to specifications that would only suit us immortals. This process will kill every livng thing on the planet. He calls it “a clean install.”

Aloy: (sips some tea) Not if I stop him first.

Tilda van der Meer: Not if we do. And once he and the others are gone, we can work together to fulfill Elisabet's dream. I'm sure Beta told you that there's a build of the APOLLO database on board our ship? A complete collection of human knowledge. With that, and GAIA we could do everything Elisabet wanted. Heal the biosphere Educate the people of this world. Uplift them. Create the world she imagined

Aloy: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. From what I've seen your friends are invincible.

Tilda van der Meer: I do wish you would stop calling them my friends. And they're not invincible. In fact, a friend of yours has found a way to defeat them.

Aloy: Sylens?

Tilda van der Meer: Oh he's been a busy bee. Building an army powerful enough to crash through Gerard's precious base.

Aloy: Regalla and her rebels…

Tilda van der Meer: Even now, she's preparing a final march on the Tenakth capital. When she wins, she'll have the entire tribe under her control. Hundreds of warriors and machines to throw at the base. She's been duped. They’ll all perish, of course. But it should be enough to break Gerard's defenses and allow Sylens to kill him… along with all the others.

Aloy: Using the new weapon he's developed.

Tilda van der Meer: Yes. He's found a way to circumvent our shields. Truly an exceptional man. He's planned for everything. Except you and me. You see, while his army is battering down Gerard's doors, you and will sneak in through a back way. One that only I know about. While Sylens and my friends are busy battling each other, we'll take back Beta and GAIA. I told you I want to help you I mean it.

Aloy: You said Beta's not in urgent danger. So what are the Zeniths doing to her?

Tilda van der Meer: Putting her to work, merging HEPHAESTUS with GAIA. A difficult, time-consuming task as I'm sure you know. They will compel her, if need be, but her life is not in danger. She’s the only one who can do it.

Aloy: Because you people made her to be nothing but a tool.

Tilda van der Meer: Gerard's idea - not mine. They always viewed me with suspicion when I attempted any form of kindness towards her. That's why I created the Data Channel - a virtual place where we could speak in peace.

Aloy: So this channel you shared with Beta none of the other Zeniths ever found out about it?

Tilda van der Meer: Gerard believes he's the most cunning of all of us. Even after a thousand years he still can't imagine that I would outwit him. The channel allowed me to interact with Beta away from their mistrustful eyes. It offered us a chance to be ourselves. 

Aloy: Until you cut off all contact.

Tilda van der Meer: Yes, though it pained me. I was worried that our meetings would do her more harm than good.

Aloy: She felt like you tossed her aside.

Tilda van der Meer: I was afraid the others would find out and punish her. She may not have had the comforts of friendship anymore, but at least I ensured she was safe. I know it seems harsh, but you must believe that her well-being has always been paramount to me.

Aloy: Why did you make the Data Channel look like this place?

Tilda van der Meer: I built this house as a shelter to weather any storm. A safe place, not just for me, but for the art stored below. Cultural artifacts of incalculable value - truly some of the greatest achievements of human civilization.

Aloy: And you wanted Beta to see them?

Tilda van der Meer: Yes. Her upbringing was so cold and technical. I thought if she could experience Vermeer and Rembrandt it would bring something else into her life… a heritage every bit as valuable as the scientific and technical data being drummed into her. I'm sorry I had to cut off contact. But I’ll never regret sharing this house with her. She needed its shelter even more than I did.

Aloy: My old Focus - how did you find it, let alone repair it?

Tilda van der Meer: When we encountered you at the HADES Proving Lab, Gerard saw you as a redundancy. I knew better. You were a revelation. After your dramatic escape bravo - by the way - Gerard and Erik assumed you were dead and gave up the hunt. I wasn’t so sure. When the others were busy I returned to the lab and searched for any truce of you. That's when I found this little treasure. Not easy to repair, but certainly worth the effort. As I watched your life unfold… You were like a splash of color on a worm canvas. What Lis was… and more.

Aloy: Did you show it to the others?

Tilda van der Meer: Of course not. It was your actions that inspired me to defy them. It's worth noting that if I hadn’t found it and watched its contents, I wouldn't have known to save you at the Cauldron. You'd be dead.

Aloy: So I should be grateful?

Tilda van der Meer: If you like.

Aloy: So you know all about me. What about you?

Tilda van der Meer: What would you like to know?

Aloy: Well… start with your life on Earth.

Tilda van der Meer: When I was eight, terrorists flooded my home city. Thousands drowned, my parents included. I was one of the few who survived. My guardian sent me to boarding school. (sighs) Among my peers, I was the strange girl - the orphan to be avoided. All because of circumstances beyond my control.

Aloy: (incredulous) Oh. So we're a lot alike, huh?

Tilda van der Meer: Aren't we? You were an outcast, but you didn't let that stop you from getting what you needed. Neither did I. I climbed my way out of desolation and used my wits to build a fortune. First from the technical analysis of art and the detection of forgeries - profitable expertise in those days. But as it turned out, the software developed was even more useful for counter-intelligence. From there, it was only a short step to gathering extremely valuable intelligence on my own.

Aloy: (seriously) You were a spy?

Tilda van der Meer: More like a service one could turn to for information. I had to remain anonymous of course, to protect my privacy. But despite that anonymity, Far Zenith inevitably sought me out.

Aloy: What happened when Far Zenith approached you?

Tilda van der Meer: They painted an irresistible vision of humanity's future. One where we need not fear illness or death. Where we explored the furthest reaches of the stars and thrived. It was only later that I realized that they only intended to bequeath this future to the rich and powerful. By the time I finally figured it out the walls were closing in Faro's machines were devouring the Earth. So I accepted Far Zenith's invitation to a berth on the Odyssey. (regretfully) I wanted Lis to come. But she had nobler plans, as you well know.

Aloy: So you didn't know the other Zeniths were monsters until it was too late?

Tilda van der Meer: I knew some of them were, certainly. It wasn't until we were off-planet that I understood the true scope of their greed. I was grateful to simply be alive. But the others became obsessed with a kind of effortless immortality. They built a colony where machines serviced their every need, where any memory - or fantasy… …could be endlessly savored in virtual reality. It wasn't life. It was stultifying, a pampered dream-state. As the decades passed, I withdrew more and more. Alone, yet again, but this time with eons to consider my mistakes. Now, finally, having met you - I feel like I have a second chance.

Aloy: To do what?

Tilda van der Meer: Help you of course. To fulfill Lis dream which isn't so different from Far Zenith's original vision - a better future for humanity.

Aloy: Beta told me your colony was destroyed. That you came back to Earth because you had nowhere else to go.

Tilda van der Meer: It's true. After we reached our destination - a planet in the Sirius star system - we spent decades building a new home. The physical constraints of Earth, the boundaries of mortality… gone. To think of what we could have done with it. It might have been a Utopia. Instead, we stagnated, absorbed in effortless comforts and virtual realities. It took a cataclysm to finally yank us out of our stupor.

Aloy: What happened?

Tilda van der Meer: A massive geological event. We knew of instabilities in the planet core, but we underestimated them. By the time the collapse was upon us, it was too late to stop it. Only a few of us made it to the ship in time. We set course for Earth, the only safe harbor left to us.

Aloy: Which you decided to make unsafe for anyone else.

Tilda van der Meer: Not me. Gerard. He believes it's better to wipe the canvas clean than work around the smudges. No more primitive tribes. No more combat machines. Only a blank slate to do with as he pleases. But we will stop him. All we have to do is get into that base.

Aloy: What exactly is your plan to sneak into the Zenith base?

[Tilda opens a holographic map.]

Tilda van der Meer. We will make use of a lesson learned from an early age: always know your exits. In this case, a place where Gerard's new construction meets the ancient foundation. A passage that only I can access. When Sylens flings his army at the base, we will enter through this back door bypassing most of the fighting. The distraction will provide us with a window in which to rescue Beta and GAIA.

Aloy: Once we’re inside the base, where will we find Beta and GAIA?

Tilda van der Meer: Here, in the command center. By then, GAIA will have been reunited with all of its subordinate functions including HEPHAESTUS.

Aloy: What about the alpha build of APOLLO on your ship?

Tilda van der Meer: A simple matter of recovery once the others have been dealt with. With that in hand we'll have everything we need to make this world as it should be

Aloy: How do you know about Sylens plan?

Tilda van der Meer: He isn't the only one adept at spyware.

Aloy: You hacked his Focus?

Tilda van der Meer: No. He's too careful for that… But his subordinates - not so much. He gave additional Focuses to the tribals he branded the "Sons of Prometheus.”

Aloy: The ones working with Regalla.

Tilda van der Meer: By tapping their Focuses, I learned about most of his dealings. The distribution of override technology, the arming of Tenakth rebels, and the secret pact with Regalia to attack Gerard's base.

Aloy: But how did he come up with a weapon that can take down your shields?

Tilda van der Meer: That's the one thing I haven't been able to figure out. But however he did it I'm quite certain it will work. With it and the Tenakth army victory seems to be within his grasp. Such a shame he'll be disappointed.

Aloy: Regalla’s only interested in killing Hekarro and waging war on the Carja. What does she have to gain by attacking Zeniths?

Tilda van der Meer: It's the price she must pay for her war. Without the ability to override machines, her little rebellion would've languished in the desert.

Aloy: So she trades with the Sons of Prometheus. Machines to help her overthrow Hekarro…

Tilda van der Meer: In exchange for an assault on the base. Pride has deluded her into thinking she can actually survive such a battle. And all without ever knowing who the Sons of Prometheus really answer to. Yet for all of Sylens' brilliance still he underestimates you. That blind spot is what will allow us to take Beta and GAIA right out from under him.

Aloy: While hundreds of Tenakth are cut down outside. So you knew Elisabet. What was she like?

Tilda van der Meer: Lis was… Everything she was, I see in you. And more. Your ingenuity, your determination, your moral compass. You've managed to distill her greatest qualities and make them your own.

Aloy: I'm not asking about me. Tell me about Elisabet. What was she really like?

Tilda van der Meer: The honest answer is that I don't actually know. For all the time that I spent with her she always kept a part of herself locked away. It was like that from the moment we met.

Aloy: So when you met Elisabet, She was what? Distant? Aloof?

Tilda van der Meer: Not aloof. Not exactly. It was a summit in Paris about machine learning - a touchy subject in those days… because regulatory authorities were just starting to clamp down on AIs. Lis gave the keynote address. She had already achieved great renown for her work in automated environmental reclamation. But in her address, she was just starting to imagine the next step… an AI-driven system that wouldn't just act on its programming, but actually take responsibility for its sphere of influence.

Aloy: To care about life, not just follow orders.

Tilda van der Meer: Revolutionary stuff. I was fascinated. And I had wanted to meet her for a long time. I watched her after her talk. She had spoken with such moral authority, such empathy - but after that she retreated. I could tell she felt uncomfortable with all of her admirers. It was as if giving the talk had cost her something. I didn't want to be a pest so I planned my approach carefully.

Aloy: So how did you finally approach Elisabet after her talk?

Tilda van der Meer: I picked the right moment, the morning of the next day, right as she came back to the conference. She had just had her coffee. She was fresh, rested. It was like she had braced herself for the onslaught of colleagues. I asked if I could walk with her, then put forth a question about her talk. That thought was intelligent. Her answer made me realize it wasn't. But she was very welcoming, almost as if we were previously acquainted. It was only halfway through the conversation that realized she knew exactly who I was. It was quite a shock to me. My business was trafficking in secrets, and I took great pains to protect my anonymity. So that was Lis - perpetually one step ahead. I came to view our meeting as a metaphor for our friendship. She always seemed to know me far better than I knew her.

[Aloy stands up.]

Aloy: I guess I know the feeling. First Varl, now Hekarro and the Tenakth. Your plan would wipe out an entire tribe. There has to be another way.

Tilda van der Meer: We are in an admittedly desperate situation. But I assure you there isn't. Remember Zero Dawn. Elisabet's sacrifice. Sometimes many have to die for a new world to grow.

Aloy: (to herself) If it looks impossible, look deeper. Wait. The Data Channel. It still exists, doesn't it? I need you to open it. Let me talk to Beta.

Tilda van der Meer: Impossible. We might be detected.

Aloy: It's worth the risk. There is another way. One where the Tenakth survive.

Tilda van der Meer: But we won't if the others--

Aloy: If you want to help, open it.

[Tilda hesitates for a moment but obeys. Aloy finds a holographic image of Beta. She sits on a chair with a painful look on her face.]

Aloy: What are they doing to her?

Tilda van der Meer: Virtual reality dissociation. The manual merge of HEPHAESTUS will take hours upon hours of tedious micromanagement. If she resist the work, they run simulations to induce feelings of isolation and despair.

ALoy: Beta, can you hear me?

Beta: You're alive. They're watching me. I can't hold up this extra projection for long. You should've killed me.

Aloy: No! No look at me. I'm coming for you - I promise. Okay? I just need you to hold out a little while longer and work on the merge.

[She whispers something to Beta.]

Beta: Then I think it can be done.

Aloy: I’ll contact again when it's time. Can you hold on?

Beta: As long as I know you're coming for me, I can endure anything.

[The connection closes.]

Tilda van der Meer: All right. I did as you asked. Now I think you need to tell me what you're planning.

Aloy: I'm going to take Sylens army away. I don't need it - only the weapon he made to penetrate your shields.

Tilda van der Meer: And how do you propose to get it? Ask him nicely?

Aloy: Without Regalla and her rebels, he won't have a choice. We'll be his only option.

Tilda van der Meer: Only option for what? What did you tell her?

Aloy: That is between me and my sister. We'll be Sylens' only option for crashing that base. I'll tell you the rest later. But first, there are a couple of things I have to do.

Tilda van der Meer: Oh? And what are those?

Aloy: Lay my friend to rest. And then I'm going to use the override that Beta gave me at GEMINI to put an end to Regalla's rebellion… from the air.

Tilda van der Meer: Wait. Since you insist on doing things your way, I know of something that will truly help you make a grand entrance with the Tenakth.

[She shows Aloy a map of a giant machine.]

Tilda van der Meer: The ancient Horus Titans still possess electromagnetic energy cells as part of their arsenal. Drop one of those on Regalla's army and they'll receive quite a surprise. So go, do what you must. I'll come to your base if you manage to bring Sylens to the table.

Aloy: Not if. When.

[Tilda leaves. “All That Remains” interlude completed!]

THE WINGS OF THE TEN
Aloy: Erend? Are you there?

Erend: (via Focus)  Aloy?! Aloy, is that really you?

Aloy: Yeah, it's me. Where's everyone else?

Erend: We're all... we're back at base. What happened...?

Aloy: It... it might be easier to explain in person. I'll try to join you there when I can.

Erend: (via Focus) Okay. We'll wait here for you. It's good to hear your voice, Aloy.

[Aloy travels to the base.]

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Just to let you know… I'm now patched in to your Focus network.

Aloy: Great. l take it the other Zeniths can’t hear us?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Of course not. And they don't know about your base either in case you were wondering. I’ve sent you data on the Horus energy cells you can use against Regalla's forces. Reach out to me when you’re ready to acquire one.

Aloy: Understood.

[She enters the base. All the inhabitants look gloomy. Kotallo bangs his knife on the table. Erend drinks.]

Kotallo: When you're wounded, you have to strike back. Draw blood!

Erend: Hey! Can't I get one damn minute to mourn my friend?

Kotallo: Regalla is going to slaughter my tribe to overthrow Hekarro. The Zeniths have Beta and GAIA. We can't sit around wallowing in our losses!

Zo: Kotallo's right. We must fight.

Erend: All right, so what're we gonna do? Huh? Take on all of Regalla's rebels?

Alva: Not to mention the Zeniths. What can we even do - throw ourselves at their base?

Aloy: (enters) Something like that. Zo…

[They hug.]

Zo: After we lost contact with you, we regrouped and went to GEMINI. What happened? The recording we found on Varl's Focus cut off when that Zenith Erik...

Aloy: The Zeniths were tracking HEPHAESTUS. When GAIA trapped it in GEMINI, they… they knew where we were. After Varl tried to stop them, they took Beta and GAIA. I only survived because one of the Zeniths turned against the others to save me

Zo: One of them? Well at least we didn't lose you, too. So what do we do now?

Aloy: We're going to defeat the Zeniths and get Beta and GAIA back. But first, we're going to stop Regalla.

Kotallo: How?

Aloy: Back in GEMINI. Beta gave me... a gift. There's something I need to do first to make it work, but it could put an end to the bloodshed.

Kotallo: Word is Regalla's readying her army for an all-out assault on the Grove. I… need to be there.

Aloy: I know. Go. Stand with Hekarro. And keep an eye on the sky.

Kotallo: Strike true as the Ten.

[He leaves.]

Aloy: The rest of you... whatever preparations you need to make - upgrades, resupplies - get on it. It won't be long before we take the fight to the Zeniths.

Zo: We'll be ready, Aloy. And when you're ready, meet me outside the east exit. I'd like to have a word in private. (leaves)

Alva: Even when things are darkest, you're the flame that lights the way forward. (leaves)

Erend: Just tell me one thing. Am I gonna get to smash up a bunch of Zenith bastards?

Aloy: We all are.

Erend: Good. (leaves)

Aloy: (to herself) Before I do anything else, I should check on Zo. It sounded important.

Erend: I thought you were gonna go fight some Tenakth.

Aloy: I wanted to check in with you first.

Erend: Don't worry about me. I'm just picking up the pieces like everyone else. I'll be there when you need me.

Aloy: I never doubted that.

Erend: Oh. Good… I'm glad you're back.

Aloy: So am I. I know you hate waiting, but you'll have to stay back here a little longer.

Erend: You go do what you gotta do, but… Are you okay? It's not just Varl we lost. Beta’s gone… I almost lost it when I realized my sister had been taken by Dervahl back in the Sundom.

Aloy: I'm getting her back. That's all that matters.

Erend: Understood.

Aloy: Do you think Zo will be okay?

Erend: I don't think anyone's ever okay after losing the one they love. I can tell you she's handling it better than I ever did. Keeps the rest of us level-headed.

Aloy: You should know Sylens is involved with the Sons of Prometheus.

Erend: Why doesn't that surprise me. That's probably all part of some master plan, huh?

Aloy: Least we know we're good at wrecking those.

Erend: Damn straight.

Aloy: I need to get going.

Erend: You better get there before Kotallo tries to take on Regalla's entire army by himself. And do me a favor? Don't go disappearing on us again?

Aloy: I'll do my best. 

[She goes to Alva.]

Aloy: You look busy.

Alva: My studies are a good distraction, especially after Cauldron GEMINI. Varl. Beta. GAIA. Gone. And that's just the beginning. The Zeniths want to rob us of our future, too.

Aloy: We won't let that happen. So, all of the tribes here are new to you?

Alva: Yes! I've been studying up on them. The most fascinating one thus far has been the Tenakth. An entire culture based on the holograms of an ancient museum… There's much they've misinterpreted… not unlike the Quen. But still, there's a nobility to what they've become. They're honorable. And fearless.

Aloy: And deadly. How are you holding up?

Alva: Varl's loss is heavy on everyone's mind. I didn't know him well, but I can see how much he meant to the others. Zo and Erend seem to have taken to it the hardest. But I don't quite know what to say to them.

Aloy: They need time to sort through it.

Alva: And what about you? Will time heal your wounds?

Aloy: I don't know. I try not to think about it. Seems like everyone's ready to take the fight to the enemy.

Alva: Kotallo more than most. If I were this Regalla, I wouldn't want to cross him on the battlefield.

Aloy: Regalla still has a lot of machines on her side.

Alva: That's where you come in, I suspect.

Aloy: If my plan works. Tilda, the Zenith that Beta mentioned. She was the one who rescued me.

Alva: Did she say why?

Aloy: She knew Elisabet Sobeck. Seems to think helping me is honoring her in some way. She was willing to share information on both Sylens' plans and the other Zeniths.

Alva: But you still don't trust her. Where I come from the more valuable the knowledge shared, the higher the price extracted. I'd be careful if I were you, Aloy.

Aloy: What was Leviathan again?

Alva: A flood control system back in the Great Delta. It was built by Eileen Sasaki, another of our ancestors. If we can acquire the data on it, we might be able to fix the system back home. Then my sister, my parents, other families - won't have to live in fear of their homes washing away when the long rains come.

Aloy: Right. And to find it, we need to head back to San Francisco. I should get going. Be ready to go on my signal, okay?

Alva: I won't let you down.

Aloy: I know. And I haven't forgotten about the data on Leviathan. I’ll let you know when I make it back to Landfall.

Alva: Thank you, Aloy.

[Aloy goes outside to talk to Zo.]

Aloy: Skin’s cracking from the cold.

Zo: Over here, Aloy. 

[Aloy finds Zo in a small garden on an edge of the cliff.]

Zo: We would come out here to tend to the garden. Sometimes I needed fresh air, other times we would simply sit and watch the sunrise. So when we returned from GEMINI, it seemed fitting that he be laid to rest here. Now he can always look out at Plainsong. And further east... to the Nora Sacred Lands.

Aloy: He would've liked that.

Zo: He often spoke of his sister, Vala. He said she used to gather her favorite golden blooms and tie them to her spear. Their mother called it useless, but Vala was stubborn.

Aloy: Yeah, she seemed like that.

Zo: It wasn't easy, but I tracked down the flower. Gathered its seeds. 

[She plants the seeds near the grave.]

Zo: (singing) As verdant limbs wither, roots rot in snow… Still the seed rises, as certain as stone. (stop singing) From death follows new life. So it is with the land... and so it is with us. (touches her belly) I'm with child, Aloy. I was going to tell him when he got back from GEMINI. Instead, one day, I’ll bring our child here. We'll sit among the blooms and watch the sunrise.

Aloy: I never got to tell him - to thank him. For saving my life, sure, but also for not giving up on me.

Zo: He always knew. (stands up and leaves)

Aloy: Goodbye, Varl. I promise to look after them. (leaves the grave) I'll try to visit again when I can. But for now… I need to go to the Fabrication Terminal to install the new override on my spear. Then I use it on a Sunwing and get ready for an entrance Regalla will never forget.

[She returns to the base.]

Erend: Oh. Before I forget. I watered those plants for you.

Zo: Oh?

Erend: I just know they meant a lot to you and... uh… ...well...

Zo: Thank you, Erend.

Aloy: Think you can manage things here while I go help Hekarro?

Zo: Stopping Regalla's war... It'll help us take the fight to the Zeniths?

Aloy: Yes.

Zo: Then I'll make sure the rest of us are ready upon your return.

Aloy: Okay. We'll be facing Specter drones soon. Erend and Kotallo have fought them before, so--

Zo: Already asked them to run us through some combat drills. Erend moves like an oaf.. but he's good with that hammer.

Aloy: How's Erend doing?

Zo: For a moment there he thought he'd lost both you and Varl. But he never truly succumbed to despair. Guess that Oseram stubbornness comes in handy sometimes.

Aloy: I know we both want to make the Zeniths pay for what they've done. But once we infiltrate their base our priority will be to get GAIA and Beta out of there.

Zo: Don't worry, I won't go seeking revenge like some blood-crazed Tenakth. Wherever your arrow strikes, mine will follow.

Aloy: Let's hope we hit our targets. I need to get going.

Zo: Whatever you plan on doing against Regalla, you better return to us in one piece.

Aloy: I'll try.

[She uses the workbench on the base to install the override.]

Aloy: Override installed. Now to find a Sunwing. I think there are some roosting at the top of the mountain.

[She climbs on top of a high mountain.]

Aloy: Okay. I need to find Sunwing to override. Better head up the mountain. Good, there are Sunwings up here. I'll have to approach them quietly

[She overrides sleeping mechanical bird.]

Aloy: Got it!

[Now it's time to fly the thing like in Avatar.]

Aloy: Whoa! Okay. This is it - I'm in the air! (via Focus) Tilda. I’m in the air.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Then you'll want to pick up an energy cell on one of the ancient Horus Titans. But first you must send out a pulse to activate them. I've sent you the necessary software. To deploy it, you'll have to override one of the communication machines you refer to as "Tallnecks." There's one in the middle of the desert that should do nicely.

Aloy: On it.

Tenakth Soldier: (from below) Look! She's flying!

Aloy: Race? Well, they definitely don't sound like rebels. Maybe if I follow their tracks I can find out where they're headed. I can probably use my Focus to follow the tracks those riders left behind. There's the Talineck Need to get on top of its head. Now how to land this thing.

[She lands right on top of the flat headed giraffe looking machine.]

Aloy: Made it! Just gotta override it. Okay Tilda. I've overridden the Talineck.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Good. Then the energy cells are now primed. Simply pick one up on a Horus. The nearest one should be northwest of your position. Dropping it on Regalla’s machines should produce quite a spectacle.

Aloy: Thanks for the assist.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) I told you. I want to help.

[She whistles and rides the bird again.]

Aloy: Whoa! I'm gonna have to get used to that. Regalla's rebels. Reinforcements, maybe. Heading for the Grove. I hope Hekarro and the Tenakth can hold out for a little longer.

Tenakth Soldier: (for below) By the Ten, she flies!

Aloy: There's the energy cell right on the Titan's back. Got the cell. Now on to the Grove. The pulse from the Tallneck should have reactivated all the energy cells in the region. I should be able to pick up more from any Horus I fly to. Could be useful, even after I deal with Regalla. All right. Here we go.

[She attacks Regalla’s machines from the bird. Meanwhile Urekka fights Dekka.]

Urekka: Regalla's inside. Hekarro will soon be dead. It's all over, Chaplain.

Aloy: Gotta drop it now. Here it goes!

[She drops the bomb that appears o be an EMP grenate. It disables a few heavy machines.]

Dekka: Is that..? It's Aloy! 

Urekka: She flies on the Wings of the Ten!

Dekka: The tide has turned! Push through!

[The balance of power on the battlefield changes. Hekarro's warriors attack the rebels. Aloy flies to the castle, where Regalla has already cornered Hekarro.]

Regalla: End of the line, Hekarro. Now on your knees and I'll give you the death you didn't have the spine to give me.

[Regalla’s warrior rushes in, panting.]

Rebel Soldier: They're down! The machines - all of them they're down!

Regalla: What? How that possible?

Aloy: (from the bird) REGALLA! Enough bloodshed. Let's settle this - you and me.

Regalla: Easy to say when you're atop a machine!

[Aloy jumps off the mechanical bird.]

Aloy: Well, that was just to get your attention. I don't need any help to take you down.

Regalla: Fine. I accept your challenge. And once I'm done with you… l'll get to finish the slaughter.

Aloy: We'll see about that.

Hekarro: The duel is set. Let none interfere.

[There is a brief fight between Aloy and Regalla, after which they jump into the vast arena. The fight begins!]

Aloy: Damn, they saw me. 

[Under the onslaught of powerful two-handed sword blows, Scarlet retreats, jumping to the bottom of the arena, putting himself in a tactically disadvantageous position. Regalla draws his bow.]

Aloy: All right, so that's how it's gonna be.

[A long firefight ensues, which results in Regalla pulling out a pilum and throwing it at Aloy. The pilum splits into several explosive darts, which break the platform on which Aloy is standing. Regalla goes down after her.]

Regalla: This is where it ends.

Aloy: Yeah. It is. 

[After a long fight Aloy wins.]

Regalla: Here l am again, on my knees before bootlicks and cowards. Go ahead. Run me through!

Kotallo: Shut your mouth, traitor. (spits on her)

Hekarro: It was you who flew in on the Wings of the Ten, you who challenged her. By our rites you must decide her fate. I spared her once. It only made things worse. She was the best of my Marshals. What a waste.

Aloy: She's dangerous, all right. But maybe that's exactly what I need.

Regalla: Cowards! What more do you have to conspire about?

Aloy: Whether you live or die. 

[The player has to choose the fate of Regalla.]

Aloy: After all that you've done, I can't let you live.

Regalla: Finally. (stands up) Then claim your--

[Kotallo suddenly pierces Regalla with his spear.]

Kotallo: There. Blood for blood.

Aloy: Guess that's over then.

lvvira: Chief, there's something you both need to see in the throne room.

[They move to the throne room. Hekarro’s warriors cheerfully salute them. In the throne room, the guards bring the captive Oseram wearing a leather mask.]

lvvira: He surrendered to our guards outside the Grove. Claims he has an urgent message for “the outlander who defeated Regalla.”

Hekarro: So state it.

Prisoner: It's for her alone…

[He reaches into his pocket. The guards point their spears at him.]

Prisoner: ...from an interested party.

[Aloy takes the small thing the prisoner handed to her.]

Aloy: I'm gonna need some privacy.

Hekarro: Clear the room. Put him with the rest of Regalla's soldiers.

[The prisoner is taken away.]

Kotallo: I'll see you back at base. (salutes and leaves.)

Hekarro: You saved the tribe. Let me help you with your mission.

Aloy: No. With Regalla gone you have a chance to build the future you dreamed of. So get to your task.

Hekarro: Then at least allow me to give you this. Regalla's bow. May you always strike true with it.

Aloy: (accepts the gift) Thank you.

[Hekarro leaves the throne room. Aloy scans the Focus the prisoner brings her. A holographic image of Sylens appears.]

Sylens: Do you have any idea what you've just done?

Aloy: Oh, it's a pleasure to see you, too, Sylens.

Sylens: Congratulations on your victory. You saved the Tenakth for a few weeks. Unfortunately you've doomed the entire planet as well.

Aloy: Wrong. I don't need a Tenakth army to defeat the Zeniths.

Sylens: Oh, Aloy. Have you learned nothing about the enemy we're up against?

Aloy: More than you, hiding in whatever hale you found. My idea is just better than anything you ever came up with.

Sylens: Go on.

Aloy: No not here. We're doing this my way. Face to face and with the weapon you've developed.

Sylens: And why would I agree to that?

Aloy: Because I'm your only way of beating the Zeniths and getting the copy of APOLLO that's on their ship. So meet me at my base. Mountains west of Plainsong. Time to submit to the inevitable Sylens, and follow the person who actually knows what she's doing. Don't be late.

[She closes the call and smashes the Focus with her foot. “THE WINGS OF THE TEN” quest completed!]

Aloy: Tilda, you there? I did it. Sylens is on board. So head to my base.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Impressive. I'll be there as soon as I can.

Aloy: (to herself) Now that I can fly, I might want to see what else I can do before I head back.

[She flies to Memorial Grove to speak to Dekka.]

Blood for Blood (start)
Dekka: Aloy. You defeated Regalla! Flew like the Ten! I doubt you have enough skin to mark all your deeds.

Aloy: We'll just have to remember them, then.

Dekka: Yes. Thanks to you, Chief Hekarro's hold on the tribe is secure. His vision for the Tenakth endures. But that's not why I wanted to speak with you. I need a favor. A personal one. My grandson, Kavvoh. He was not counted among the dead, which means he must still be with Regalla's remaining forces.

Aloy: He was taken prisoner?

Dekka: No. He joined them willingly, like many young soldiers who seek to mark their skin with distinguished deeds. I must search for him. Convince him to come home. Chief Hekarro cannot spare any soldiers for this task, so my blade is alone in this. Unless you'd be willing to join me. I know it is much to ask after all you've done for us. But Kawoh is the last of my blood.

Aloy: What made Kavvon au Regalla's rebellion?

Dekka: For some, Regalla represented a chance at vengeance against the Carja. During the Red Raids it wasn't easy to turn the clans back at Barren Light. Many wanted to pursue the Carja all the way to Meridian.

Aloy: So when Regalla attacked the Embassy they took it as a call to arms?

Dekka: Yes. But others, the young, especially - care only about the glory they think they'll earn by hunting an age-old enemy. As for Kavvoh… it was probably a bit of both, and a youthful desire for a cause to get the blood burning. Nothing I said could stop him.

Aloy: So if Kavvoh didn’t listen to you when he joined the rebels, what makes you think he will now?

Dekka: Kavvoh was too young to fight during the Red Raids. War was a stranger to him. But he must've experienced the suffering it brings by now. He will listen. He must. I just have to find him before it's too late.

Aloy: You said Kavvoh's your last living relative?

Dekka: Yes. Before Chief Hekarro, the clans. Warred constantly with each other. Every skirmish claimed another comrade. One by one, I buried my children, and then their children.

Aloy: (sighs) I'm sorry.

Dekka: I tried to vent my grief on the battlefield, but I never found comfort there. Only in the wisdom of the Visions. And even so, I still couldn't prevent Kayvoh from following the trail of blood.

Aloy: If Kavvoh joined Regalla's rebellion of his own accord, will Hekarro let him back into the tribe?

Dekka: The Chief knows the value of mercy. And the toll of unending bloodshed. It's the rest of the tribe I'm more concerned about. They won't quickly accept someone who betrayed them. Even with my support, it won't be easy.

Aloy: But you have to try. I'll help you find your grandson, if I can. Where do we start?

Dekka: Awhile back our scouts reported Kavons squad left one of Regalla's outposts in the hills to the south.  His squad never returned, but the scouts also spotted one of our own being held captive there.

Aloy: So we'll start at the outpost. If we free the prisoner, maybe they'll know where Kavvoh's squad went.

Dekka: Shall we head out?

Aloy: I have some other things to take care of first. I can meet you there.

Dekka: I'll wait for you on the hillcrest southeast of the Grove. We'll make our way to the outpost from there. Until then, strike true.

[Next Aloy flies to Stone Crest.]

Terakka: Champion. Over here! I've got something to tell you. I'd keep your bow handy if you plan on traveling west to the coast. It's infested with machines, likely on account of a Cauldron that lies nearby.

Aloy: Thanks for the advice. (to herself) A Cauldron. If I can find its core I might be able to get some machine overrides. Might be worth the risk.

[She overrides another Sunwing.]

Aloy: Overriding Sunwings - Beta's gift. Now I can take to the skies.

That Was Lost (continue)
[She flies to meet Kotallo and help him test his new arm.]

Aloy: I think this is where Kotallo wanted to test out his new arm. Even though he didn't say how exactly. I should let him know I'm around and find out. Hey, Kotallo. I’m by the Tremortusk site, where we agreed to meet. Wanna test that new arm of yours?

Kotallo: (via Focus) I'll be there shortly.

[After some time he arrives.]

Kotallo: Thank you for waiting.

Aloy: Maybe now you can tell me what we're doing here?

Kotallo: Not just yet. Follow me, please.

Aloy: Someone's being awfully mysterious.

Kotallo: You took your sweet time telling me what you wanted to do to the Bulwark. Consider this my revenge.

Aloy: Fair enough.

Kotallo: This is it.

Aloy: What am I looking at?

Kotallo: Oh, you'll see. Come.

Aloy: All right, talk to me, Kotallo.

Kotallo: I wish to test the arm on that.

[In the distance there’s a wild mean looking machine resembling a hyena.]

Kotallo: It has menaced the valley for some time. Killed more than a few of the Sky Clan. But no longer.

Aloy: I'm honored to help.

[Kotallo attaches his new arm. It misses a few fingers, but it looks cool and practical.]

Kotallo: After you.

Katalo: Let’s see how this thing likes the taste of metal.

Aloy: Better use something other than fire. 

[Together they defeat the beast. Kotallo rips off the metal heart of the machine with his new arm.]

Aloy: Well, I think it's safe to say the new arm works fine.

Kotallo: Agreed.

Aloy: Then why are you taking it off?

Kotallo: This is what I am now. What I overcame. Anything else feels… wrong. Like a disguise. I'll use the new arm when I need it. But the rest of the time, I will simply be myself.

Aloy: I wouldn't have it any other way.

Kotallo: You have my thanks. For doing this with me. Here. Something to mark our victory.

Aloy: Thank you. I'll see you later, then.

Kotallo: The Ten be with you, Aloy.

[He leaves. “That Was Lost” side quest completed!]

Forbidden Legacy (continue)
[Aloy arrives at Landfall and calls Alva.]

Aloy: Hey, Alva? I'm in Landfall. Can you meet me here?

Alva: (via Focus) I'll be there as soon as I can.

[Some time later Alva arrives at the settlement.]

Alva: (panting) Aloy! I’m here. Had to sneak past a few machines on the way, but I made it.

Aloy: All right. Ready to talk to the Diviner?

Alva: Yes. He's right over there.

Nirik: Diviner Alva. What are you doing back in Landfall? And with the living ancestor.

Alva: Were looking for the Atbay Research Center where Leviathan was developed. The Legacy tells us it's somewhere in the city.

Aloy: Alva mentioned you've been collecting data in the area. Do you know where it is?

Nirik: Uh… yes, I stumbled across it. But there was no data there, only crumbling ruins.

Aloy: Tell us anyway. We might be able to find something you missed.

Nirik: Please don't trouble yourself assure you, our search was very thorough.

Alva: You're hiding something.

Nirik: What? That - that is absurd! A Diviner must only speak truth, as you're well aware.

Alva: Oh, you're worried you found something dangerous. Something compromising on Eileen Sasaki?

Nirik: Keep your voice down!

Alva: Look. I get it. Nirik. You want to make it back to your family, so it's safer to turn a blind eye. But think of Leviathan. How it could help everyone. Isn't that why we're here? Don't let fear deny us that.

Nirik: Very well. The facility's just south of here along the shore. But even if you find a way to fix Leviathan it's sure to be shrouded in that which is… Forbidden. 

Alva: Too often the truth is forbidden. (to Aloy) Come on. Let's go.

Aloy: Not bad with that Diviner back there. You've come a long way since we first met.

Alva: Nirik's like I used to be. Terrified of a misstep. And with the Overseers, he has every right to be. But what I've seen and learned since the Greenhouse… it's so much more than what we're permitted. Diviners are supposed to seek the truth and yet so much is kept from us. I'm tired of it. That should be the facility ahead. Hmm. We need to find a way in.

Aloy: Up there. Well, Nirik wasn’t lying about crumbling ruins at least. Let's look around.

Alva: Uh, Aloy. Why is the ground shaking?

Aloy: It's not good, whatever it is.

[A Slitherfang attacks them.]

Alva: Whoa that thing is huge!

Aloy: We’ll have to take it out if we want to find that data!

Alva: Uh… okay! I'm with you.

[They defeat the giant snake machine.]

ALoy: Down it goes!

Alva: Phew! Well, I'm gonna have nightmares tonight.

Aloy: We should be able to look around for that data now.

Alva: Hmm. Lot of sand, not a lot of data.

Aloy: Through here.

Alva: After you.

Aloy: Time for a swim.

Alva: At least the water's not freezing. Look at this place. I always try to imagine what it must've been like, back when the Old Ones were here.

Aloy: Less of a climb I bet. Come on, let's check the upper floors. Uh I don't think I'll be able to follow you there. Ha.

Aloy: You okay?

Alva: On every expeditions the soldiers would lay down walkways and barriers fist. To protect us Diviners. But this is actually kind of fun.

Aloy: There. A console.

Alva: Must've been what Ninik found.

Aloy: Let's see if it has anything on Leviathan. Hmm. The data on Leviathan isn’t here but there's some kind of log.

Researcher: (on record) Delete the database? But Ms. Sasaki, when you look at the reports - three thousand exhibiting symptoms, over four hundred dead. The data's clear. Omuramba is contaminating the water supply promoting bacterial growth. And with Leviathan based on the same architecture--

Eileen Sasaki: (on record) You're a smart kid. Top of your class, right? My father built this company thanks to world-class talent like you. And you know what else is world class? Our legal team. So unless you want to spend the rest of your career in some dead-end underfunded public research institute… You'll delete that database. And forward all data on Leviathan to my office.

Researcher: (on record) Yes, ma'am.

Alva: That was her. The Ancestor, Eileen Sasaki. Hundreds dead and she knew their system was to blame, but she had the truth erased. Were all the Ancestors like this? Selfish, ruthless, amoral? And yet we hold them up as paragons of enlightenment and virtue. Given what we've learned, I don't even know if Leviathan will work.

Aloy: Hold on, let's not give up just yet. You said before that the Old Ones used Leviathan to control flooding. Which means it probably worked. We'll know more when we find the data on it. The recording mentioned a copy was sent to Eileen's office.

Alva: To their corporate headquarters… There.

[She points at a tall building in the distance.]

Alva: Let's go. It shouldn't take us long to get to the tower.

Aloy: Lead on. So what was that other system the recording mentioned? "Omuramba"?

Alva: The Legacy tells us it was the predecessor to Leviathan. A system that manipulated foods to bring life to a barren desert. 

Aloy: The Ouen seem to know a lot about this Ancestor.

Alva: Diviners spent years trying to figure out how to restore Leviathan. We found a lot of data on Eileen Sasaki in the process. Though now I wonder how much of it is actually true.

Aloy: (to herself) Entrance is blocked. Gonna have to find another way in.

Alva: The soldiers built a path on the nearby ruin. Might be able to cross over from there.

Aloy: Lead the way.

Alva: I think this is as far as our soldiers got.

Aloy: We'll have to climb higher to get into the tower.

Alva: I'll follow your lead. Up we go.

Aloy: You doing okay, Alva?

Alva: Yes! Don't worry about me. How are we going to get across?

Aloy: That beam looks promising.

Alva: This is a lot higher up than thought…

Aloy: Glinthawks. Well, we have the element of surprise.

Alva: Or we could sneak by. And, you know, not fall off the tower.

[They decide to just sneak past the bird.]

Aloy: Up this way.

Alva: Uh... Aloy? We're really high off the ground.

Aloy: You can do it, Alva, okay? Just don't look down.

Alva: Right. (fake laugh) Of course. Super easy.

Aloy: There's the tower. Should be able to cross over.

Alva: Aloy!

Aloy: I'm okay. Got to clear some of that debris first. Okay. Should be able to make it to the other side. Made it. 

[She finds the door to the offices.]

Aloy: Okay, Alva! Your turn.

Alva: Right. Yeah.

Aloy: Better make sure Alva makes it across before I take a look at this.

Alva: Aloy, can you watch me and make sure I do this right?

Aloy: Come on, Alva. You can do it. It's okay.

[Alva walks along a thin beam to offices.]

Alva: Please don't break…

[Suddenly she falls…]

Alva: AHHH!

Aloy: Alva!

[...but catches the other side.]

Alva: I'm okay! (laughs) Wow, that would've been a long way to fall.

Aloy: Door's locked. I think it needs a passcode. Let's look around. Huh. This says the code is the month and year the company was founded.

Alva: According to the Legacy, it was October 2023.

Aloy: Got it. Door should be unlocked now. Maybe the data on Leviathan is in here.

[She finds an audiolog dated January 10th 2047.]

Eileen Sasaki: (on record) "Cost reduction strategy"? We're talking about people's lives here. I did as you asked on Omuramba, but this is... worse.

Kenzo Sasaki: (on record) Relax, Eileen. I've spoken with Risk Management. They're confident that the chance of another incident is within acceptable parameters. We're moving ahead with Leviathan.

Eileen Sasaki: (on record) You know, Dad... shortcuts have a way of catching up with you. Within acceptable parameters or not. Well, one day in the distant future, when you're in charge you can run things how you want.

Kenzo Sasaki: (on record) But until then, how about you let me worry about that?

Aloy: Guess Eileen and her father didn't always get along.

Alva: Doesn't matter. She still had a part in it.

Aloy: Well, let's keep going. Her office must be higher up. Well let's keep going.

Alva: Dead end. There's a ladder in that shaft, but it's blocked.

Aloy: There's nothing for my Pullcaster to latch on to. I might be able to pull the rubble out from the other shaft. Let's see where this leads.

Alva: Uh, you go on ahead. I'll look for a way up that has a lesser chance of falling to my death.

Aloy: Okay. Hey, Alva?

Alva: Yes?

Aloy: There's something I don't get. You said Eileen was the one who built Leviathan, not her father. So what happened?

Alva: I'm not sure. The Legacy doesn't say. Either that knowledge is Lost or Forbidden… Or maybe we were wrong about that too. Are you doing okay, Aloy?

Aloy: Yeah. It's just a long way up. Now how to get up higher? How about you, Alva? Any luck finding a way up?

Alva: Not yet.

Aloy: Phew. Glad that's done with. Okay, I'm back at the shafts. If I blow up that Firegleam, the elevator might fall and open up a path for Alva. Hey, Alva? Step away from the shaft.

[She blows the Firegleam and clears the shaft.]

Alva: Whoa! Oh, I can reach the ladder now. Be right up, Aloy!

[Aloy climbs to the top floor.]

Aloy: Looks like there's another floor above. Might be Eileen's office.

Alva: Okay, I'll meet you up there.

Aloy: All right. Alva's on the way. Let's see what's up here. Another locked door. Need to figure out the passcode.

Alva: Made it! These artifacts... I think these were Eileen's. It's every Diviner's dream to discover even one of the Ancestor's artifacts.

Aloy: Wonder if my Focus can show me anything. And maybe they'll help with the door. It's... art, I think.

Alva: Could it be… yes, I think this was commissioned in honor of the company's 25th anniversary. Oh, that must be the Larsen-McCorry Award. The Legacy says Eileen won it when she was 40... for her work on Leviathan.

Aloy: Interesting.

Alva: That must be the Dragonfly-6. Atbay used it in most of their construction projects.

Aloy: Huh. This looks like some kind of prototype.

Alva: For water purification. Must be the H2Flow.

Aloy: The... what?

Alva: H2Flow. Their early inventions had strange names.

Aloy: Hmm. Maybe try my Focus. What did you say this was for again? The company's 25th anniversary. Looks like it used to be on the last pedestal. All the numbers you mentioned… I wonder if they make up the passcode?

Alva: It's worth a try.

[Aloy tries the code and it is the correct one.]

Aloy: That did it.

Aloy: You can almost see the whole city from up here!

Alva: Corner office, impressive view… it must've been Eileen's.

Aloy: Let's see if the data on Leviathan is here.

[She touches the holographic screen on the desk and a holographic image of Eileen Sasaki appears before their eyes.]

Eileen Sasaki: (on record) Well, it's official. Eileen Sasaki, CEO, chair... and worst daughter in the world. Security had to escort Dad to his vert. Guess we'll be speaking through lawyers from now on. Looking down at the world from here, it's hard to see the details. People become risk factors, statistics. Far too easily. Omuramba was supposed to provide clean water - improve lives. It was easier to pretend there wasn't a problem. Easier to believe the lie was truth. But I don't want to pretend anymore. I will build Leviathan right. No more shortcuts. No more lying just to save face. It won't undo our sins - my sins. But maybe we can still do some good.

Alva: She overthrew her father, took over the company… so that Leviathan wouldn’t end up killing people.

Aloy: It sounded like she regretted covering up Omuramba's failure.

Alva: She wasn't perfect. Not a paragon, as the Quen believe… But not a monster either. She tried to make up for her mistakes.

Aloy: And now you know the truth.

Alva: As for the data… Leviathan... yes. It's here. Downloading a copy now.

Aloy: Is something wrong?

Alva: I think I'll stay here a while longer. There's a lot more data that I want to look through.

Aloy: Are you sure you'll be okay on your own?

Alva: Down is always easier than up. Let's speak again when we're back at base.

Aloy: Okay. I'll see you there.

[“Forbidden Legacy” side quest completed.]

Aloy: Well, after climbing all the way up, why not glide down…

Alva: You're going to what?

Aloy: Just thinking about it.

[She jumps off the building using her hologlider after which she flies to help Dekka.]

Blood for Blood (continue)
Dekka: Aloy. The outpost is just over there. Are you ready?

Aloy: The rebels aren't going to give up without a fight.

Dekka: Then we'll have to give them one. They didn't stand down when Regalia was defeated. I doubt they'll surrender now. What matters is their prisoner, Nakalla. Maybe she knows where Kavvoh's squad went.

Aloy: Okay. Let's head in, then.

[They approach the rebel’s camp.]

Aloy: These holdouts don't give up easily. Still, if I get rid of their leader, it might send the others packing.

[She and Dekka defeat the rebels.]

Aloy: Strange. Planks of wood… with nothing on top of it. That's all of them.

Dekka: Our scouts said they saw Nakalla tied up at a wood post.

Aloy: Let's look around.

Dekka: I'll rest here until you return.

Aloy: Tags from dead soldiers. I should return them to the Grove when I get a chance.

Dekka: There. That's the post.

Aloy: Well, no Nakalla, obviously. But maybe the rebels moved her. I can look for tracks. There. Tracks leading away from post.

Dekka: Where do they go? 

Aloy: There's rope. Just enough to bind someone. Blood. From the rebels or Nakalla?

Dekka: Dead end.

Aloy: No. I think there’s something under that wood!

[They double back the boards wrapped with rags. They served as a secret hiding place. Inside they find a woman.]

Dekka: Take my hand, Nakalla. Steady now.

Nakata: Where am I? Chaplain? Is that you? And with an outlander?

Aloy: Whoa. How'd you end up down there?

Nakalla: Rebels had me strung up. They thought I'd give up intel about Lowland squad movements by letting me bake in the sun. Managed to slip my bonds and make a run for it. They made me pay for that. Last thing I remember was a crack on the head and the taste of dirt. How'd you end up here?

Dekka: We're looking for Kavvoh His squad was last spotted leaving this outpost.

Nakalla: Yeah, he was here. It was his squad that attacked us on the road. My comrades got away, but I was taken. Kavvoh tied me to the post himself. If you're looking for him, Chaplain. I'm afraid you'll only find a dead end. His loyalties are clear.

Aloy: Do you know where his squad went?

Nakalla: I overheard them mention Fall's Edge.

Dekka: Then we'll… we'll pick the search up from there. I'll go ahead and meet you at Fall's Edge, southwest of here.

Aloy: Dekka, if Kavvoh attacked her squad.

Dekka: (strict) No. He's not lost to us yet. We have to find him and turn him from this path.

Aloy: Okay. I'll see you there. 

[Dekka leaves.]

Aloy: What about you? That wound needs to be looked at.

Nakalla: It'll scar. I just need to rest a bit, then I'll report in to the Grove. I'm telling you, blood-hair. The Chaplain might not want to hear it, but her grandson is a traitor.

Aloy: (sighs) I guess we'll see about that.

[She finds Dekka and Kevvog at Fall’s Edge.]

Kavvoh: I'm telling the truth!

Dekka: Listen to him, Arokkeh.

Arokkeh: Not a chance. He's a traitor.

Aloy: Dekka, what's going on?

Dekka: Aloy. I'm glad you're here. This is Arokkeh, leader of Fall's Edge.

Arokkeh: So you've enlisted the Chief's Champion in your dull-bladed efforts.

Aloy: You must be Kavvoh, then.

Dekka: My grandson. And a soldier trying to right his mistakes.

Arokkeh: Or trying to lure us into a trap. My scouts caught him sneaking around on the outskirts of the village.

Kavoh: I wasn't sneaking around, I was coming to warn you! The rebels are planning an attack. They're going to send a machine straight through this village. I left my post when I realized what they were planning. You have to believe me.

Aloy: Where are the rebels now?

Kavvoh: They were hunting for the machine north of here. I can show you the way.

Arokkeh: The only thing you'll do is face trial by combat. You betrayed your clan, your Chief. Blood and blades will decide your fate.

Kavvoh: I'll fight whoever you want. After we stop the attack!

Aloy: Why destroy this village? Regalla's defeated. The rebellion is over.

Kavvoh: Not for some. Losing Regalla only gave them one more reason to hate Hekarro.

Arokkeh: And Hekarro was a Lowlander before he was Chief. Unlike the Desert and Sky Clans, we've always stood behind him without question. Fall's Edge is a strategic midpoint between the Grove and our capital on the coast.

Kavvoh: It's true. The others hope that by weakening the Lowland Clan, they'll be able to strike back at Hekarro.

Aloy: You said you defected after you found out about the attack. Why'd you change your mind?

Kavvoh: When I joined the rebels, I thought Regalla was going to lead us into battle against our old enemy, the Carja. But all we've done is kill each other. And for what? Pride? Vengeance? So when my squad leader told us about the mission to destroy this village, I left my post.

Arokkeh: Don't believe his lies. Anyone who deserted the tribe to join Regalla knew exactly what they were getting themselves into.

Dekka: Not everyone.

Aloy: If Kavvoh is telling the truth this whole village is in danger. We have to find and stop these rebels.

Kavvoh: The rebels built a campfire north of the river, near the cliffs. I can show you the way from there.

Aloy: Okay. Open it up, Arokken.

Arokkeh: No. I won't give him the chance to escape. The traitor stays here until his trial by combat.

Dekka: Then I invoke blood for blood. I will take Kavvoh's place, until he returns.

Arokkeh: You're making a mistake, Chaplain. The dan needs your guidance, not the lies of this bare-armed boy.

Dekka: The rite has been called. Kavvoh will go with Aloy.

Arokkeh: Then I'm going too. If the boy speaks truth, you'll need my blade. If he lies, I'll run him through. I must make arrangements here, first. Then I'll bring the boy to the meeting place.

Aloy: Fine. I'll see you there.

[Aloy flies to the place.]

Aloy: The campfire that Kavvoh mentional should be nearby.

[She hears some voices.]

Aloy: Someone's waiting ahead. But not Kavvoh or Arokkeh. Rebels. Friends of Kavvoh's? Going to have to take them out to get to that campfire.

[She kills the rebels.]

Aloy: Were these rebels waiting to ambush whoever showed up? Kavvoh has some explaining to do. Better wait at the campfire for him and Arokkeh.

[Arokkeh with tied up Kavvoh approaches the campfire.]

Aloy: Found a few of your friends when I got here, Kavvoh. You're not off to a great start.

Kavvoh: They must've been out on patrol. I swear on the Ten I didn't know they'd be here.

Arokkeh: What did I tell you? His lies are an open sore. Better we cauterize it now than let it fester.

Kavvoh: No. I'm telling the truth!

Aloy: Untie him.

Arokkeh: As you say. But this is a mistake.

Kavvoh: And my weapon?

Arokkeh: If you think--

Aloy: Just give it to him, Arokkeh. We need to get moving.

[Arokkeh unwillingly hands Kavvoh a club.]

Arokkeh: (to Kevvoh) Lead the way.

Kavvoh: Up this way.

Aloy: Where are you leading us?

Kavvoh: The rebels are stationed at the nearby cliff falls. I took this path when I left my post. The others won't be expecting anyone to come this way.

Arokkeh: Or they are and we'll be skewered the moment we arrive.

Kavvoh: There's the cliff falls.

Arokkeh: And there's no one there. As I suspected.

Aloy: Let's just keep going.

Arokkeh: I don't like this.

Kavvoh: Where is everyone?

Arokkeh: No rebels, no machine. What did, I--

Aloy: Over there, by the falls!

[They notice a Behemoth in a camp of rebels.]

Arokkeh: Blood of the Ten. If that thing runs through Fall's Edge, the village stands no chance.

Aloy: Then we stop them. Right here.

Kavvoh: On your lead, Aloy.

Rebel Soldier: Nothing will stand in our way now!

Aloy: Should hit that canister with a Frost Arrow.

Rebel Soldier: Grab your gear! We march on Fall's Edge!

Rebel Soldier: We’re under attack! 

Regalla Rebel: It's Kavvoh! He led them right to us!

[Aloy, Arokkeh and Kavvoh defeat the rebels and the Behemoth.]

Kavvoh: Ah!

Aloy: Kavvoh… you're bleeding.

Kavvoh: I'll be fine. What matters is the attack was stopped.

Arokkeh: Because of your warning. You saved many lives today.

Aloy: Come on. Let's get you back to Fall's Edge.

Kavvoh: Guess I cracked some ribs, too.

Arokkeh: Go on ahead. I'll see him back to the village.

Aloy: Okay. I'll let Dekka know what happened.

[She returns to Fall’s Edge and goes to Dekka, sitting in a cage.]

Dekka: Aloy. I saw your deeds at the Grave. Three leave, only you return. What happened?

Aloy: Kavvoh was telling the truth. The rebels had a Behemoth. Kavvoh was injured in the battle but we stopped the attack. Arokken --

Arokkeh: Regrets that he doubted the boy. Your grandson proved himself to be honest and brave, Chaplain. He's loyal to the Lowland.

Aloy: So you'll release him?

Arokkeh: He's earned his freedom. But it'll take many more deeds to earn back the rest of the clans trust.

Kavvoh: I'll do whatever it takes.

[Arokkeh releases Dekka.]

Dekka: Thank you, Aloy.

Arokkeh: Indeed. Fall's Edge owes you a great debt. May this begin to repay it.

Aloy: Thank you.

Dekka: As soon as you're healed, I have so much to show you.

Aloy: Welcome back, Kavvoh.

[“Blood for Blood” side quest completed.]

Aloy: Cannot catch a break from this heat.

Valley of the Fallen (continue)
Aloy: That must be the entrance to the Valley of the Fallen. Marshal lvvira should be around here somewhere. There's Marshal Ivvira. With one of the missing Tenakth.

Kenalla: We have to go back!

Ivvira: You're not going back in. You need a medic.

Kenalla: But Daxx--

Ivvira: You saw what happened as clearly as I did.

Aloy: Marshal Ivvira? I heard you were sent to rescue some Tenakth who went into the valley. I'm guessing you must be one of them. Where are the others?

Kenalla: They didn't make it.

Ivvira: I had to fight off several machines just to get Kenalla out. The valley was closed months ago for good reason. Machines have gathered in number, as if they're drawn there by something. Not to mention the strange glowing lights off the coast.

Kenalla: The valley is cursed. We never should've gone in.

Aloy: Ivvira… you were made a Marshal at the Kulrut. And you were by Hekarro's side in the final stand against Regalla.

lvvira: And you're the one who flew on the Wings of the Ten. Ended Regalla's threat in single combat.

Aloy: I was just doing what I could to help.

Ivvira: In an amazing way! And I saw what you did with my own eyes! Here I thought the Kulrut was the best day of my life. Becoming a Marshal, bearing witness to the vision of Unity… But you really outdid yourself against Regalia Ibave a lot to live up to.

Aloy: You said there are strange lights off the coast?

Ivvira: From an island to the south They appeared one day out of the blue, around the same time the machines moved into the valley. There have also been reports of a streak of light that rises and falls in the sky above the island.

Kenalla: I saw it on the fourth night. A flame that climbed in the sky until it disappeared among the stars.

Aloy: Is there any way to get to the island?

Ivvira: No. The currents between the island and the shore are too strong. You'd drown for sure.

Aloy: Lights on an island… I wonder if this has something to do with the Zeniths.

Ivvira: Don't know what any of thats about, but.. maybe?

Aloy: If the valley's been off limits for months, why did you go in?

Kenalla: We wanted to run the trial.

Ivvira: The valley is a great test for Lowland soldiers. Survive for ten days and nights. Take down any machine that stands in the way.

Kenalla: Daxx had a plan Wed hunt down each machine, one by one, until we cleared the valley. Earn the clan's respect. But we got separated from Yivekka  after the third day. Then machines cut us off from the way out. By the time Marshal lvvira found us we were wounded and out of supplies. More machines attacked us as we made our escape. Daxx was right behind us, but… he couldn't run fast enough.

Aloy: A lot of machines in one place. Sounds bad. I better look into it. see if I can put a stop to it.

Ivvira: Then I'll come with you. Fight by your side.

Aloy: No. Better let me take a look first. Trust me, it's for the best.

Ivvira: I guess if you insist. Once you're in the valley, head for the great falls and the cliff south of the Metal Devil. The machines seem attracted to those sites.

Aloy: Got it. Thanks.

Ivvira: We'll rest here a while more, then head for the medic in Fall's Edge. Strike true as the Ten, Aloy.

[Aloy flies to the place.]

Aloy: Glowing lights this must be the Zenith base. Looks like they have a shield around the entire place. Of course they'd make their base on their own private island. Hold on, Beta. We're coming for you soon. But back to the current problem. I've got to check out the areas Ivvira mentioned - near the big waterfall and south of that Horus on the ridge. There's the waterfall. And killer machines, as promised. If I'm right, there should be a lure around here. I might be able to find it with my Focus. Acid won't make much of a dent. There! That should fry it's circuits a bit. There. Area's clear. Better take a look at that lure. Okay. Let's see if I can turn this thing off. There's data here… look like a log from something called the “Julius.” Some Zenith AI? Says "local vermin exterminated." Was it attracting machines… to kill intruders here? Well, at least this lure’s shut down now. I should head to the cliff south of the Horus. There might be another lure there.

[Aloy fights another pack of heavy machines.]

Aloy: It’s stunned! Now! I can switch it up. Can't do much without ammo! I'm done with this. Covered it in Acid! Okay. I should look around. See if I can find a lure. Another lure. Better deal with it. All right. Now to shut this thing down. Another weird log from "the Julius." This one mentions a third lure close by. I better check it out. And it looks like I was right. The Zeniths left these things here to draw in machines and protect the approach to their base. Better fill up while I can. There's the lure. Have to take out these machines before I can shut it off. It can't take the heat! First, I have to take out the machines. Then I can override the lure. Should be able to override the lure now.

Yivekka: An outlander? I must be hallucinating. What's an outlander doing all the way out here?

Aloy: Clearing the valley. You must be one of the missing Tenakth. Everyone thought you were dead.

Yivekka: Nearly. Daxx and Kenalla, are they…?

Aloy: Kenalla's alive. Marshal Ivvira pulled her out.

Yivekka: Speaking of…

Ivvira: Aloy!

Aloy: Ivvira. Couldn't stay away, could you?

lvvira: And miss my chance to hunt with the Champion in the Valley of the Fallen? Never. And I see you found Yive-- Now this looks like a fight!

[A mighty Specter attacks them.]

Aloy: You with me, Marshal?

Ivvira: My blade is yours!

Aloy: Fire's wasted on that machine.

Ivvira: Blood of the Ten we get to kill these things? What are they? Aloy! Where are you going? The fight's not done!

Aloy: Clipped it!

lvvira: Aloy! Let's finish this fight! We can't retreat now! We have to finish this! We can't retreat now! We have to finish this!

[They manage to defeat Specter.]

lvvira: We did it! That was amazing! I'll go check on Yivekka.

Aloy: I should override the lure nearby. Make sure no more machines are drawn here. Gotcha. That should be the last one. And looks like there's a recording here…

Erik: (on record) Hey shithead, I got a task for you. 

The Julius: (on record) The Julius is ready to serve!

Erik: (on record) Shut up and do what you're told. Use the indigenous robots to keep this place clear of local vermin. I'd do it myself, but Gerard says I have to “stay focused" So, have some fun for the both of us, huh?

The Julius: (on record) Will do, Benefactor Visser! You can count on the Julius!

Aloy: So Erik left a simple AI in charge of the lures. Looks like it shut itself down when I overrode the last one. Well, I should let lvvira know the valley's clear.

[She returns to Ivvira.]

Ivvira: (to Yivekka) I'll be right back. (to Aloy) She needs a medic, but she'll live. Thanks to you. Gotta say, every time we meet is the best day ever for fighting. That battle was something else. And those weird machines! Do you think there'll be more?

Aloy: No. I figured out what was causing the machines to gather in the valley - and put a stop to it.

Ivvira: Oh. Good news for the clan, then

Aloy: You don't want to fight more of those things, Ivvira. They're not like other machines. The masters they answer to see people as… inconveniences. They'd kill anyone without a second thought. And eventually, I'll have to deal with them.

Ivvira: The lights offshore. Is that from them?

Aloy: Yeah. It's a kind of shield to protect the island. The machines drawn to this valley were meant to kill anyone who got close.

lvvira: Meaningless slaughter. But definitely something for a Champion, not a Marshal. Here, take this, then. It might help with what lies ahead.

Aloy: Thank you. The valley should be safe enough, for a while. But you have to tell the rest of the Tenakth to stay as far away from that island as possible.

lvvira: By the Champion's word. I hope our paths cross again, Aloy.

[“The Valley of the Fallen” side quest completed. Aloy flies to the snow-capped mountains following information from the locals. She notices a hexagonal metal cover on the ground, from which comes a powerful blue blaze. She goes down to inspect the find.]

Aloy: This must be the "ground made of metal" that Tenakth soldier mentioned. Looks like a Cauldron door. But it's different. There's no way to hack it open. If I can find some other way in, I should be able to get data to override some new machines.

[She's looking around.]

Aloy: If the Banuk can survive freezing, so can I.

[She finds a massive hole in the ground. The hole leads, most likely, to the closed Cauldron Iota.]

Aloy: This crevice is massive. As if the earth split open fast. Wonder where this leads. This must be the Cauldron I couldn't get to above. It looks damaged. Earthquake must have hit here, too. I hope the core is still intact. Then I should be able to find data on how to override some new machines. Here we go. Almost there… Is that… a forge? Looks like it's making machine parts. There! Machine's vulnerable! Those forges. I might be able to climb them to get to the other side. Gap's too wide. Need to find another way across. Looks like I can hack into this. Should be able to climb these. There's something behind these broken panels. Maybe I can bust through? A hunter-killer. A guardian of other machines. That looks like it can get me up to the vent. So that's what this place is making a Tallneck. The earthquake must have interrupted the process. I just have to expose the core and get those overrides. Oh, that can't be good. There it goes! Okay. Time to get those overrides. Should be able to override more machines with this. 

[She plugs the spear into the connector and downloads the data.]

Aloy: More corrupted data. If I get the right parts, I can restore it like GAIA showed me. 

[The platform on which she was standing rises and Tallneck stands on it. This car is so huge that we can only see the legs.]

Aloy: Whoa--whoa! There seems to be a Tallneck blocking this platform. I'll have to find a different exit. Looks like there's room underneath the core. Maybe I can squeeze through. Easy does it. Don't want to fall. That looks like fun. Almost there. Let's not do that again. Uh-oh, I've been spotted. That Tallneck's not going anywhere soon. These vents should get me across if I time it right. Looks like the only way across is up. That's why the Cauldron won't release the Tallneck at the core. It's missing its head. If I can attach it back to the body, I can unblock the exit. One of HEPHAESTUS's hunter-killers. This should get me to the head. That metal arm. I think I can drop down if I time it right. Now! Jammed. Maybe I can pry it open… Yes! Uh-oh. Company. Time to follow up! There! Let the Acid do its job! Better find my way back to the core. I think I can hear the head being repaired… Head's in place. Big guy's fixed. But that metal arm's keeping it in place. Maybe if I override the Talineck, the shockwave will break it free. Here goes nothing. It worked! 

[She rises from the Cauldron on Tallneck's head.]

Aloy: Feels good to breathe some fresh air again. View isn't too bad either.

[She returns to the base in a good mood.]

Erend: Hey, uh, Mr. Know-It-All is here. You know, your Focus buddy who never smiles. I didn't know what to do with him, so I had him wait in your room.

Aloy: Got it. Thanks.

[And FINALLY Aloy meets Sylens in the flesh and actually talks to him.]

SINGULARITY
Aloy: Well, Sylens. Looks like you finally found a door you could open without me.

Sylens: I'm glad it's there, actually. It kept me from having to mingle with the company you keep. But enough prattle. I believe you owe me an explanation - your plans for the Zenith base.

Aloy: You're right. I do owe you - my spear in your throat for deceiving me again, at the HADES Proving Lab.

Sylens: I doubt you asked me here for that kind of reckoning.

Aloy: No. Right now, I need your help. So I'm giving you one final chance. But if you ever betray me again, I will kill you no matter what the circumstance. Understood?

Sylens: Very well. Though we'll both face a decidedly short future if you can't get us inside that base.

Erend: (via Focus) Aloy - your other guest is here. She's, uh, coming to you.

Aloy: Thanks. Good timing. The truth is, I can't actually get us into the base. But she can.

[Tilda enters the room.]

Sylens: The company you keep is even worse than I thought.

Tilda van der Meer: Not a fan of surprises, are you? Ah, look. That must be your little invention.

Aloy: Does the weapon work? Without self-destructing?

Sylens: Of course it does. I've eliminated the imperfections and greatly improved its design… and output.

Tilda van der Meer: How can we be sure?

Sylens: Care for a demonstration?

[Sylens and Tilda menacingly look at each other.]

Aloy: Enough, both of you. We're in this together, at least for now. Go talk to Erend. Tell him I said to give you rooms of your own. I'll come see you when I get a chance.

[Sylens puts on his large hiking backpack and walks to the exit of the room. He signs to let Tilda go forward.]

Tilda van der Meer: Oh, no. You first.

[They leave the room.]

Aloy: Better get everyone in the Control Room so Tilda can tell us what she knows about the Zenith base.

Zo: You know. We've never played Machine Strike together.

Erend: Oh no, I've got enough trouble with Kotallo always kicking my ass.

Zo: Who says I'm any good at it?

Erend: The way my luck’s going, I'll bet you're a pro.

[Aloy visits Sylens in the lab.]

Sylens: Did you need something? Bravo. You managed to sway a Zenith to your side. Care to explain?

Aloy: Not a chance. I thought you said the weapon was ready.

Sylens: There's always room to optimize. But that's not why you're here. I assume you want to comprehend my undertakings. So, ask away.

Aloy: Since when were you so forthcoming?

Sylens: Since you turned this into a waiting game. And as it seems you have found… …modest success, perhaps I'm willing to be generous.

Aloy: Okay, so your big plan - everything you've been manipulating for the last few months. Let me see if I got this straight. You learned about the Zeniths from HADES, when you interrogated it. Then you came up with a plan to defeat them - by using a Tenakth army and that weapon. And to get the Tenakth to fight for you, you - or rather, the Sons of Prometheus - armed Regalla's rebels with override tech.

Sylens: Did you have an actual question or are you still playing catch up?

Aloy: So all this time… even before I found the coordinates at the Spire - you were out here scheming. Why couldn't you just tell me?

Sylens: When I learned of the Zeniths' return to Earth, I laid out my plans. I knew I would one day require an army of overzealous Tenakth to assault the Zenith base. The casualties would be… extreme. And I knew you would never allow such a sacrifice, no matter how necessary. Thus, I devised a means to remove your  interference from the equation - at the HADES Proving Lab.

Aloy: You wanted me to surrender to the Zeniths at the HADES Proving Lab. They almost killed me.

Sylens: Based on everything I knew about them, I concluded they would find you a useful asset. Thereby keeping you out of harm's way and, more importantly, out of my way.

Aloy: So you really didn't know they had their own clone of Elisabet?

Sylens: No. Unfortunately, there was no way I could have known that particular detail.

Aloy: Detail? Well… I guess if it wasn't for that, we wouldn't be here today. Why create the Sons of Prometheus? You didn't need a bunch of Oseram tinkers to make override tech.

Sylens: They were a necessary safeguard. My time serving HADES and the Eclipse demonstrated the risks of getting directly involved. Through the Sons of Prometheus, I could execute my plans… all while remaining anonymous.

Aloy: Tell me about the weapon. How does it work?

Sylens: I've upgraded the delivery system. It now emits a wave-like effect covering a significant distance.

Aloy: (sighs) That doesn't fully answer my question.

Sylens: No, but I'd be a fool to reveal its inner workings. After all, why did you withhold your plan for dealing with the Zenith drones? Yes. Even you can appreciate the value of secrecy when warranted. Suffice it to say that the weapon will work. The intricacies of "how" is knowledge that is mine alone.

Aloy: Why help Regalla take over? If you wanted an army, you could've just gone to Hekarro.

Sylens: Before Regalla's rebellion, Hekarro was only concerned with battling machines and fostering friendship with the Carja. Even if gained his ear, he would never agree to send his forces to battle a threat he couldn't understand.

Aloy: So helping a bloodthirsty exile was easier?

Sylens: Yes, exceedingly so. All Regalla craved was war - against the Carja and anyone who threatens the Tenakth. She would have led the tribe into battle without question, which was precisely what I needed.

Aloy: While I was out there, I had a couple run-ins with the Quen.

Sylens: The tribe from across the ocean. And?

Aloy: Their entire tribe was shaped around the discovery of Focuses. One of them - Alva - even joined me here. Don't you want to know more about them?

Sylens: No. They stumbled upon the greatest technological artifact from the ancient world and what did they do with it? They shrouded the knowledge they unearthed in mysticism and taboo, creating a pantheon out of corporate shills.

Aloy: Yes, well… it also led them to Thebes.

Sylens: Did it now?

Aloy: So, those run-ins with the Quen I mentioned. On one of them, I teamed up with their expedition to search Thebes. We found Faro at the end.

Sylens: You must have needed Omega Clearance. So… what was it like?

Aloy: Worse than you can imagine.

Sylens: He single-handedly wiped out collective human knowledge. I'm sure it was still less than he deserved.

Aloy: Let me guess you would've scraped him into a jar so you could prod his brain, like what you did with HADES.

Sylens: For a start.

Aloy: All right, Sylens. I think I've talked to you long enough. I'll let you know when it's time to go. And try not to mess with Tilda while you're in here, okay? I don't need the two of you butting heads.

Sylens: Ah, yes. About your Zenith ally. I wonder if you understand what kind of person you're dealing with. For someone to live as long as she has, outlast as many calamities… Well, your goals may be aligned now but I'd watch for the moment they diverge.

Aloy: Yeah. I'm aware. Reminds me of someone else I know.

Sylens: Survival is only a necessity to my greater purpose, Aloy. I'd hoped you recognized that by now.

Aloy: Do you know something or not?

Sylens: Oh, I know a great deal of things. But on this just call it… a feeling.

Aloy: Oh, a feeling? You mean you finally had one? Huh. Guess even you can change, Sylens.

Erend: I'm…uh… going to clean my gear later. I can do yours. if you want.

Zo: I cleaned it already.

Erend: Of course.

Zo: Thank you.

Erend: Don't mention it.

[Aloy examines her old bow in her room.]

Aloy: "When it looks impossible, look deeper. And then fight like you can win." I will, Rost. Now and always.

[She examines Varl’s Focus.]

Aloy: A Focus… It's Varl's. I used to think no Nora would ever accept one. But Varl did. Even when he was overwhelmed, he refused to let me push him away. (in tears) I failed Varl at GEMINI. I should've pushed harder. I should've done more. I'd give anything to have him back.

[She examines a knife on the table.]

Aloy: With Regalla out of the way. Hekarro and the Tenakth are safe. The future is up to them now. I do wish they'd drop all the honorary names they've given me. But if I've learned anything about them, that is not a battle I'm going to win.

Zo: Hey, Erend.

Erend: Yeah?

Zo: I was thinking we could spar for a bit. When you have the time.

Erend: Oh. Uh… Sure Yeah, of course.

Zo: Might be a way to deal with my… anger.

Erend: If beating the crap out of me makes you feel better, I'm all for it.

[Aloy approaches Zo.]

Zo: Aloy. It appears that we have some interesting new guests. I'm glad to see you're okay, though. I heard you gave the Tenakth something to talk about. I was half-expecting you to burst in through the ceiling riding a Sunwing.

Aloy: Sorry to disappoint. Ready to head over to the Zenith base?

Zo: Whatever comes, we will endure.

Aloy: Thoughts on our new Zenith acquaintance?

Zo: I'd say she smells Like death, but even death smells of something. She's more like a cold piece of metal, bent on repelling all semblance of life.

Aloy: She's definitely… different. Have you talked to any of our new friends?

Zo: Erend and I tried speaking to Sylens. But apparently our "tribal prattle is unnecessary."

Aloy: Charming, isn't he? I have to go. I trust you to keep things civil around here.

Zo: I'll make sure Erend doesn't punch Sylens in the face, if that's what you mean.

Aloy: Thanks.

[She goes to talk to Erend.]

Erend: Aloy. You came back with some interesting… friends.

Aloy: Wish I could say we don't need them. But Sylens and Tilda are here for a reason.

Erend: Yeah. Enemy of my enemy and all that, right?

Aloy: Right. Doesn't look like any of our guests are making trouble.

Erend: Yet. So. Kotallo tells me you flew. Well, that's new. I’ve been busting my bolts trying to learn to read and you're out there having all the fun.

Aloy: Don't worry, you'll be getting all the fun you can handle soon. With the Zeniths.

Erend: Looking forward to it.

Aloy: I guess Sylens is keeping to himself, as usual.

Erend: I was hoping he'd give me an excuse to hammer his sorry ass to the ground.

Aloy: Please don't.

Erend: You telling me you wouldn't want to get just one good hit on that smug face of his? After everything he's done?

Aloy: Sure. Later. Right now, he's got something we need. What's wrong with your shoulder?

Erend: It hurts a little. Maybe a lot.

Aloy: What'd you do?

Erend: I tried to arm wrestle with Kotallo.

Aloy: Yeah. Maybe that wasn't such a great idea.

Erend: I was just curious to see if that new arm of his was as strong as it looked. Turns out, it really is.

Aloy: You, uh, talked to Tilda at all?

Erend: I tried. I don't think even a hot forge could melt that ice. And you say she wants to help?

Aloy: I think so. Well, let's hope. I better get going.

Erend: You know where to find me.

[Aloy goes to talk to Kotallo.]

Kotallo: The rebel holdouts cant be allowed to continue their pointless fight.

Aloy: Haven't seen you since the battle at the Grove. How are you holding up?

Kotallo: I saw you fly on the Wings of the Ten and paralyze Regalla's army with lightning. I would say that I am… inspired.

Aloy: Thank you. I guess.

Kotallo: It is I who should be thanking you.

Aloy: Things will get ugly once the Zeniths realize we're in their base. You'll need every trick you've ever learned.

Kotallo: I would have it no other way. Many soldiers died in the Old World to make sure we stood here today. We will endure on their behalf. Though I am curious how you intend to defeat the Zenith's defenses without an army of our own?

Aloy: Leave that to me. Just make sure you're ready to fight.

Kotallo: As you say. You have more then earned my trust.

Aloy: Did you meet Tilda?

Kotallo: There is something about her that doesn't seem natural. I wouldn't be surprised if my sword went through her and she didn't bleed at all.

Aloy: Honestly, with her nothing would surprise me. Anything new going on I should know about?

Kotallo: The Quen has been more… insistent than usual asking about the visions at the Grove. Her pursuit of knowledge is relentless. The Ten would have a hard time fighting her off.

Aloy: Just think of her like one of your Chaplains.

Kotallo: Yes. Only more persistent.

Aloy: I bet people are curious about that new arm of yours.

Kotallo: None more than our Quen ally, I assure you. She couldn't wait to take it apart and figure out how it works. I gave her the data I used to build the thing hoping that would satisfy her curiosity instead.

Aloy: Good luck with that. Your people keep mentioning the “Wings of the Ten.” What exactly does it mean?

Kotallo: The Visions tell us that the Ten flew on great metal machines with wings. And leapt into battle from the sky. For us, to imitate this feat is the ultimate expression of martial prowess. It is why the challengers leap into the Arena during the Kulrut. And now, you have done it. Like the deeds of the Ten themselves, it will never be forgotten. So. Tell me. How did it feel?

Aloy: I won't lie. Pretty good.

Kotallo: I can only imagine.

Aloy: I have to go, but I'll be briefing everyone on the plan soon.

Kotallo: Understood.

[Aloy visits Alva.]

Alva: Aloy! Do you have a moment? You… you flew! Kotallo told me! And took out Regalla's machines! You know what? I don't even know why I'm surprised. I saw we have visitors. And a new weapon. Does this mean we're ready to take the fight to the Zeniths?

Aloy: Almost.

Alva: Oh! And I wanted to give you this. For helping me get the data on Leviathan. I didn't really know what to give you, so I asked Zo what you might like.

Aloy: Thanks, Alva, I'll put it to good use. You sure you're okay going on this mission? I know things must be happening pretty fast for you.

Alva: I've already braved oceans and madmen who thought they were Ancestors reborn. Why not a few immortals with lethal drones at their command, too?

Aloy: Guess the more the merrier. I suppose you saw that Tilda is here. Our very own Zenith.

Alva: I almost went up to her. To ask her, well, every question I've ever had about the Legacy. Every Diviner I know would kill to get five minutes with one of the Old Ones. But now that she's here, all I feel is a vague unease. I don't know if I'm scared of finding out more uncomfortable truths, or just scared of her. Probably both.

Aloy: I hope our new guests have been behaving.

Alva: This Sylens. He's the one who built the weapon that can take down Zenith shields?

Aloy: He is. Though I wouldn't expect him to answer any questions about it. He refuses to dole out his secrets to us lesser mortals.

Alva: Oh.

Aloy: You know that special part of us that makes us warm, kind, welcoming?

Alva: Our… spirit?

Aloy: Yeah. He was born without that. Have you looked through the data we recovered on Leviathan?

Alva: There is much to sort through still, but I believe we'll be able to get it operational and turn back the floods. And I've given more thought to everything we've uncovered about the Ancestors. The Overseers would have us believe they were infallible paragons. But Faro wasn't, not even close. His greed led to machines that devoured the world. The archive of the Old Ones' knowledge destroyed, just to erase his mistakes. So, when we learned that Eileen had a hand in covering up hundreds of deaths… I started to think they were all the same. Selfish, egotistical, cruel. But in the end… it's not that simple. The truth isn't a straight line of ink on a crisp scroll. It's a splatter, smudged and faded on stained parchment. Or twisting the truth to serve their own schemes.

Aloy: I doubt Bohai would agree with you.

Alva: No, nor the rest of the Board of Overseers. As Eileen said - it's easier to believe the lie is truth. But it's worth fighting for. But it's worth fighting for. And this Diviner, at least, won't settle for anything less. For that I thank you, Aloy.

Aloy: Anything new around here?

Alva: Kotallo showed me the schematics for his new arm. I recall reading about robotic limbs within the Legacy, but I never thought I'd see one in action. Technology like that would be treasured back home. Think of what it could do for injured workers or soldiers! But knowing the Imperial Family, they would use it for different purposes. Their own.

Aloy: Replacing body parts as they grow older. Like the Zeniths.

Alva: Exactly.

Aloy: I need to wrap up a few things, but stay sharp.

Alva: I'll be ready when you call.

[She walks around the base.]

Aloy: Oh. I guess this door's unlocked now, with GAIA gone. Beta's things.

Erend: Just you wait, Varl. We're taking those space lugs down.

[Aloy visits Tilda.]

Tilda van der Meer: There you are. Well done, Aloy. Despite my reservations, you managed to secure Sylens and his weapon. You're truly a shining example of Lis' fortitude.

Aloy: I've been thinking about what you said at your house. How you were friends with Elisabet. It was more than that, wasn't it?

Tilda van der Meer: Perceptive as ever. You're right. We were together, for a time.

Aloy: Okay… so what happened?

Tilda van der Meer: I was an orphan. I had always been alone. By my thirties, I was starting to wonder if that was simply my fate in life. Then I met Lis. We kept running into each other at conferences. We'd have coffee. At some point it became drinks. I thought it was just shop talk, an exchange of ideas. But then I was surprised at how much I looked forward to seeing her. Soon we were flying halfway across the world every other week just to meet up. For the first time, I didn't feel lonely. I could imagine a future where I wasn't. I think Lis felt the same way, at first. She had lost her mother a few years back. I filled a void for her. I know I did. But as time passed, it seemed as though she wanted less when I wanted more. And so we ended things.

Aloy: So, helping me… restoring Elisabet's dream… it's what, a--

Tilda van der Meer: A second chance, yes. I made a mistake, leaving Earth while Lis stayed behind. I should've done more. So when I saw you… a woman who has carved her own remarkable path, beyond even what made Lis a phenomenon. I knew I had to help you. To do right by her.

Aloy: Why did you make the Data Channel look like your house?

Tilda van der Meer: I built that house as a shelter to weather any storm. A safe place, not just for me, but for the art stored in its depths. Cultural artifacts of incalculable value truly some of the greatest achievements of human civilization.

Aloy: And you wanted Beta to see them?

Tilda van der Meer: Yes. Her upbringing was so cold and technical. I thought if she could experience Vermeer and Rembrandt it would bring something else into her life… …a heritage every bit as valuable as the scientific and technical data being drummed into her. I'm sorry I had to cut off contact. But I'll never regret sharing that house with her. She needed its shelter even more than I did.

Aloy: You said before that you're not like the other Zeniths. That you never were. But you went along with all of their plans.

Tilda van der Meer: Out of necessity. I'm not proud of it, but complicity became a means of survival. Both when Earth was consumed, and when the colony on Sirius was destroyed. I did what I had to. But I resolved to remain one step ahead of the others. To try to undo what damage I could. Hence, the Data Channel with Beta. The secret passage into their base. And the little trick I pulled to save you.

Aloy: Why do you think Elisabet pulled away?

Tilda van der Meer: I've wondered that for a thousand years. She was brilliant, a visionary. She cared so deeply for the world, for the betterment of humanity. But it also felt like she kept everyone at arm's length, including me. She never wanted to share her burdens. I think… in the end, she had a core that she never let anyone be part of. Sometimes I wonder if anyone really knew her.

Aloy: I found a recording of you and Elisabet back in the Proving Lab. After Far Zenith's attempt to steal GAIA.

Tilda van der Meer: Yes. A most unpleasant conversation.

Aloy: She said something after the call. I think she regretted how things ended between you.

Tilda van der Meer: Did she? All this time… Thank you for telling me. I've always hated that those were the last words we ever said to each other. And that her last impression of me was as a functionary of Far Zenith - not who I truly am.

Aloy: When it's time to break into the Zenith base, what can we expect?

Tilda van der Meer: I'll go over the full layout once you've assembled your friends. Suffice it to say, we will need to push as fast as possible to Beta and GAIA's location, dealing with heavy resistance along the way. There are also printing facilities, where the others have been amassing the natural resources they've stripped from the region.

Aloy: What for?

Tilda van der Meer: First, for use in the bases infrastructure, and then to fabricate more Specter drones - a small army of them.

Aloy: When I was out in the wilds, I saw a shuttle take off from the island, heading for space.

Tilda van der Meer: It was likely ferrying materials to and from our ship in orbit. After hundreds of years luxuriating in our digital comforts, the ship was barely space-worthy when we made our escape. Disaster can strike at any moment. We've learned our lesson.

Aloy: Have you figured out how Sylens' weapon works?

Tilda van der Meer: No, and he's been very careful not to allow me near it. I'll admit it bothers me. But regardless of how it functions… I am confident it will deactivate the others' shields en masse.

Aloy: How many of them are in the base?

Tilda van der Meer: Ten, including Erik and Gerard. Only a handful of us made it to our ship when our colony collapsed.

Aloy: So… Erik. Was he always a bloodthirsty psychopath?

Tilda van der Meer: I believe he got worse over time. On Earth, he was the founder of a profitable private military company - a band of cutthroats in other words. Even as governments abandoned human combatants in favor of automated warfare… He found success with clientele that required a more… personal touch. There were also rumors that he personally hunted and killed his targets, on occasion -  all for the thrill of it. But on Sirius, he retreated to virtual reality simulations. In them, he could go on rampages as violent as he pleased, though I suspect with diminishing satisfaction.

Aloy: Alva's tribe believes he was one of the greatest people from the Old World,

Tilda van der Meer: Then they would be quite disappointed to meet him. Though I'm sure he'd bask in the adoration.

Aloy: What can you tell me about Gerard?

Tilda van der Meer: He was the head of the world's largest financial conglomerate. It made him one of the wealthiest people on Earth, and certainly the wealthiest among Far Zenith.

Aloy: What does one person do with that much money?

Tilda van der Meer: Buy more. More power, more influence. Gerard's always believed himself to be a refined patrician, able to maintain control with a polished smile. But beneath that exterior is a cold and calculating operator. It was his decision to restrict Beta's upbringing to her digital educators, the avatars of the APOLLO database. While we were painted as her "benefactors."

Aloy: Well, we'll deal with him soon enough. And the others.

Tilda van der Meer: I would very much like to see his face when he realizes we've beaten him.

Aloy: When I was in the ruins of Vegas I found data on a man named Stanley Chen. I think he was a Zenith.

Tilda van der Meer: Stanley. Ever the optimist. He was one of the good ones. When we established our colony, he built an exact replica of Las Vegas in virtual reality. Lights, shows, gambling… every detail, perfectly re-created. And while others cloistered themselves in their own fantasies, he flung his doors wide to everyone.

Aloy: The way you're talking about him, I'm guessing he didn't make it back to Earth?

Tilda van der Meer: No. He perished when our colony was destroyed. He would've been thrilled to discover that part of his beloved city survived.

Aloy: When Beta escaped and hid in an ancient research facility, I saw another one of the Zeniths - Verbena. Who was she?

Tilda van der Meer: A dull star amidst a sea of brighter constellations. Unlike most of Far Zenith's members, who amassed their wealth through shrewd business deals and technological achievements… Verbena inherited her billions. Her father had achieved great success in the luxury holotourism industry. At age twenty-four, she became the world's most eligible bachelorette, branding herself a “life designer.” Someone who leverages their fame to influence the choice of others.

Aloy: What like a cult?

Tilda van der Meer: In a way, yes.

Aloy: Well…she must've done something right to have survived this long.

Tilda van der Meer: She was her own brand of ruthless that much is true. But even rats can cling to a vessel for escape.

Aloy: Okay, so I've had run-ins with a handful of Zeniths. What about the rest?

Tilda van der Meer: An array of the wealthiest people on Earth. Titans of their industries.

Aloy: And let me guess, all selfish and ruthless to the core?

Tilda van der Meer: Most, but not all. There were a few with whom I got along. Anika Moorjani, for instance, was always delightful. She founded the holonet's most successful dance channel, and was herself mesmerizing to watch. And I had fascinating discussions with Song Jiao about her work in cellular biology. Our immortality treatments are due in part to her achievements. But then there were others, like Devin Miller, the CEO of a fast-food printing corporation. His only real preoccupations were perfecting his golf swing and taking self-holos. When I think about all of us we really should've accomplished more. We had eternity.

Aloy: Okay. I'll let you know when it's time.

Tilda van der Meer: I'll be here until then. And thank you, Aloy. For giving me this chance. My past has always been a struggle. More than once, I've lost everything. But when I look to the future… I see Lis' dream fulfilled. A universe of new possibilities.

Aloy: Maybe we can make it happen.

Tilda van der Meer: We will. I won't let anything get in the way. I promise you that.

[Aloy goes to GAIA’s room.]

Aloy: Okay Maybe it's time to get everyone together so Tilda can brief us. But is there anything I should handle before that? (via Focus) All right, people. I need you up in the Control Room right away.

[Everyone gathers in GAIA’s room.]

Aloy: Okay, everyone. We all know what's at stake - Beta. GAIA. Not to mention life on Earth. Now it might seem like the Zeniths are invincible, but they're not. We've got what it takes to break into their base and defeat them. We even have one of them on our side. Tilda, show us the base.

Tilda van der Meer: It is constructed atop the ruins of an ancient military facility on an island to the southwest.

[She shows a holographic map.]

Tilda van der Meer: I can get us inside - to this location - undetected.

Sylens: How exactly?

Tilda van der Meer: You'll know when you need to. Once inside our goal will be this structure, the launch tower. GAIA and Beta are being held at the top. But along the way, we will face overwhelming resistance. Most importantly, from Gerard, Erik, and the others, but also…

Sylens: Once I take away their shields, we should be able to deal with them. But it will be easier to deploy the device if someone else is carrying it. I'll need a strong back.

Erend: Carry stuff? Yeah, I can do that!

Tilda van der Meer: Even if your device works, there will still be Specter drones - scores of them.

Sylens: If only we had an army to fight them.

Aloy: I've got that under control. You'll know when you need to. All right. We'll meet up again just before we go in. Where's the best place to rendezvous?

Tilda van der Meer: On the coast, just across from the island. Once there. I'll show you the way.

Aloy: Okay. I'll let you know when I arrive at the rendezvous point, and then you can join me. In the meantime, do whatever you need to prepare. Understood? 

[Everyone leaves the room. Aloy turns to Kotallo and Alva.]

Aloy: You two. A minute? Tilda helped me get in touch with Beta, and she told me something important. There's an installation inside the base, it's called a "regulator." Here. Once we're inside, I need you two to split off from everyone else and destroy it. So you'll have to bring explosives. This will help stop the drones. Everything depends on it. You with me? After that, I want you to find a way to infiltrate the Zenith network.

Alva: How?

Aloy: Goover all the data that Beta left behind. She knew how to do it. I'm sure of that

Alva: All right. But, why? What I am trying to do?

Aloy: Find information about the Zeniths - anything Tilda's not telling us. Sylens is right about one thing - there's no way we can take her on her word.

Alva: I'll do my best.

Aloy: Keep her safe, okay?

Kotallo: On my life.

[Aloy goes to talk to Erend before the mission.]

Aloy: We're finally doing this.

Erend: Never thought I'd be off on a mission to take down a bunch of immortals. From the stars. I can hear the drinking songs already. Oh. Earlier you mentioned something about Tenakth rebels and the Oseram, but we never really talked about it. I'm just sayin. If you want to discuss it, you let me know.

Aloy: If that one's not working right, you can have one of my spare focuses, you know.

Erend: Little bugger's got some personality, that's all. Saved my butt with those Specters. Wouldn't feel right to leave it behind now. Besides, it, uh… it goes with my outfit.

Aloy: Wouldn't want to spoil your look. Varl made the right call. You know. Bringing you here.

Erend: Thanks. Yeah. Varl. You know, I never knew he had a sister? I was well, to be honest, terrified I'd screw up the mission somehow. So he sat me down for a drink. Just one, mind you. We talked about family. Vala, Ersa. Loss and revenge. How you helped us.

Aloy: You know, we never did get that drink you promised, back in the Embrace. And you never told me exactly how your sister escaped the Mad Sun-King.

Erend: I guess we never got around to it, world ending and all. No time like the present, though. If you're up for it

Aloy: You think it's time for us to finally have that drink?

Erend: Yeah..? I mean, yeah, of course! Oh…!

[They sit down. Erend brings two mugs.]

Aloy: So. How did Ersa escape Mad Sun-King Jiran's palace?

Erend: Well, uh, first she had to survive the Sun-Ring. See during the war, the Carja threw a prisoner a day in there. And for what? To die as sacrifices, fighting machines in a pit… …thinking somehow that was gonna appease all the other deranged machines in the world? Bah. And when it was Ersa's turn, the Carja thought she'd go down if they threw a big machine at her.

Aloy: Oh, but she didn't. She defeated all of 'em. Even got some of Jiran's Kestrels for good measure. The Mad Sun-King was impressed. I guess. Thought it'd be funny to have her run around his palace as a servant. He enjoyed humiliating her that way.

Aloy: I remember you telling me something about that. That's how she met Avad. He helped her escape.

Erend: Yeah, but what no Carja scroll will ever tell you how the young prince snuck Ersa out of the palace. He knew their best chance was to get Ersa to blend in. So… He got her everything she needed to disguise herself as a Carja noblewoman - perfumes, veils and all.

Aloy: I get the feeling she wasn't too happy with that.

Erend: Oh, Ersa would’ve rather fought her way out of that palace with her bare hands than put on all that Carja eye paint. But Avad insisted it was the only way. So she agreed… under one condition. Avad had to dress up as well.

Aloy: (laughs) She made Avad dress up like a noblewoman?

Erend: As perfumed and powdered as a babe! Ersa said he looked better like that than he ever did in a crown.

Aloy: (laughs) That would, uh, definitely make for an interesting sight.

Erend: It worked like a charm, too. Not only did they make it out of the palace… They paid a traveling merchant to get Ersa to the border and none were the wiser.

[They finish their mugs.]

Aloy: You were right. That was a story best told over a drink.

Erend: All good stories are.

Aloy: I guess I should get going.

Erend: I'll see you at the rendezvous point. With my hammer ready.

Aloy: I wouldn't have it any other way. 

[She goes to talk to Zo before the mission.]

Aloy: I hope everybody's ready for this. Fighting the Zeniths isn't going to be easy.

Zo: Aloy, nothing you do ever is. At least now you don't have to do it alone.

Aloy: Thanks. Everyone here, training, working together. If it weren't for Varl… none of it would've happened.

Zo: You know there was this one night, right before Varl left with you to go to GEMINI. He realized I was having trouble sleeping. I was nervous about the mission. To be honest, I think we both were. So he asked me to join him in GAIA's dome. He brought up this hologram of Earth that you two found back in the Zenith launch facility. We sat there, just looking at it. I thought about how Plainsong was just a speck on that great sphere… How every corner of it must be teeming with life… And any fears I had about our mission were gone. I miss him terribly.

Aloy: I know. You and Erend seem to be on better terms now.

Zo: He may have terrible taste in music, but he did apologize for mocking my tribe. And that ale he keeps raving about isn't half bad. I still plan on beating that stubborn face of his to break our sparring stalemate.

Aloy: Try not to hurt him too bad. I should go. I'll let you know when I'm ready to head to the base.

Zo: Before you do, there is one favor I would ask of you.

Aloy: What is it?

Zo: You placed this Focus in my care and gave me the highest calling an Utaru has ever known. If I should fall in battle, I'd like you to be the one to bury my seed pouch. For the both of us.

Aloy: Zo--

Zo: Make sure you stay alive to do so.

Aloy: Let's just try to all come back home, okay?

[She goes to talk with Alva before the mission.]

Aloy: You nervous?

Alva: I'd be lying if I said I'm not slightly apprehensive.

Aloy: The plan will work if we all focus on our assignments.

Alva: Right.

Aloy: Once all this is over will you go back across the ocean?

Alva: I don't know. The more I think about it the more worried I become, if I go back I don't even know if they'd let me keep this Focus you gave me. Or what they'd do to me for reading what is clearly Forbidden data. Even if somehow were allowed to carry on my duties as a Diviner… Would I be willing to let the truths I've learned about the Ancestors be buried away by the Board of Overseers? Would I dare challenge them and risk my family's safety? Or losing Federa.

Aloy: The rest of us should be enough of a distraction to the Zeniths for you to hack into their network undetected. But you'll have to be quick in case they do.

Alva: What exactly do you expect me to find, Aloy?

Aloy: I don't know. The truth, if we're lucky. Who's this Federa you mentioned?

Alva: She… is another Diviner. One of our best. We used to be rivals at the Academy. I hated her guts. But apparently there's a fine line between hate and love. We became very close And then I was assigned to the expedition. She promised she'd wait for me. No matter how long it took.

Aloy: Well, that was smart of her. She won't do any better.

Alva: I don't know about that.

Aloy: I do. I want you to know I'm glad you're with us, Alva.

Alva: Whatever happens, I'm grateful that the Legacy brought us together. I never thought I'd get to actually meet an Ancestor.

Aloy: Come on. Do I look that old? Kotallo will protect you inside the Zenith base.

Alva: I'm not afraid. I know Kotallo will fulfill his duty, as will. If we die doing so, at least it'll be alongside a friend.

Aloy: I'd rather you both stay alive, if you don't mind.

Alva: We'll try and keep that in mind.

Aloy: I need to get going.

Alva: I'll be at the rendezvous point. May truth lead us to victory.

[Aloy goes to talk to Kotallo before the mission.]

Aloy: So. How are we feeling about the mission?

Kotallo: I do not know everything that you have planned. But it doesn't matter. All that remains is to follow you to the end. Whatever that will be.

Aloy: Thank you, Kotallo. I'm glad all this brought us together.

Kotallo: You brought us together. And I am grateful too.

Aloy: Now that training time is over, what's on your mind?

Kotallo: The Bulwark. The Kulrut. And how we need another miracle, if we're to survive the Zenith base.

Aloy: I'll try not to let you down.

Katallo: I know you will not.

Aloy: We didn't really get to talk about what happened at GEMINI.

Kotallo: There was nothing more to say. If he were Tenakth, Varl's bravery would've earned him sacred burial at the Grove… …among the most distinguished of our tribe's warriors. His deeds were worthy of the Ten. When the fight is done, I will have the Inkers etch his memory on my skin so that it may live on.

Aloy: I'm sure he'd be honored. I'll see you soon, then.

Kotallo: It will be my honor.

Aloy: I see you've got your new arm ready to go.

Kotallo: Yes. It still feels strange. I've gotten used to the absence. But no matter. I'm sure I will need it before the attack on the Zenith base is through.

[Well prepared, Aloy goes to the rendezvous point.]

Aloy: This'll break my fall! There. The rendezvous point. I should take care of everything I can before calling in the others to attack the Zenith base.

[Aloy calls the others. There’s no way back at this point!]

Aloy: (via Focus) Okay, everyone. I'm at the rendezvous point. It's time to rescue Beta and GAIA.

Zo: (via Focus) Understood, Aloy. We're on our way.

[Some time later Sylens approaches the campfire.]

Sylens: Aloy.

Aloy: Where are the others?

Sylens: Not far behind.

Erend: Egghead here couldn’t stand traveling with the pack.

Tilda van der Meer: Are we all here? Then let's begin.

[She opens a secret door in a rock.]

Aloy: A tunnel?

Tilda van der Meer: An ancient escape route from the ruins on the island. When I realized it ran all the way across the water… I thought it might prove useful to come and go undetected. So I concealed it from the others. Shall we?

[The group enters the tunnel.]

Alva: I wish there was a less… pungent way to get way inside the base.

Kotallo: Agreed.

[After they get to the surface, they have to do some mountain climbing. In the distance they see a structure of the same futuristic design of white abstract shapes as everything else from the Zenith.]

Tilda van der Meer: There's the launch tower. That plain offers little cover so the only viable path is through there. There will be Specters guarding it. And many more can be deployed from those hangars.

Aloy: All right. Alva, Kotallo - get to it.

Tilda van der Meer: Where are they going?

Aloy: Somewhere important. Erend, you're with me. You guys - take the high ground in case we need covering fire.

Sylens: Tactically sound, I suppose. What will she do?

Tilda van der Meer: There's a sensor node nearby. If I hack into it, I should be able to scramble the network and keep you undetected - but not for long.

Sylens: Then we should proceed. (leaves)

Aloy: One more thing. Open up the channel to Beta, audio only.

[Tilda does as Aloy says without a word.]

Beta: (via Focus) Aloy?

Aloy: We're here, and we're coming for you. You know what to do, right?

Beta: (via Focus) As long as you hold up your end.

Aloy: We will. See you soon.

Beta: (via Focus) Be careful.

[Tilda closes the channel.]

Aloy: Let's go.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Get to the launch tower as quickly as possible. I'll do my best to conceal our intrusion.

Sylens: (via Focus) Beware, Aloy. Specters ahead.

Aloy: Company. Follow my lead.

Erend: That's what I do. 

Aloy: I should hit it with Plasma. Gotcha!

Erend: I think we got 'em.

Aloy: I think you're right.

Erend: Find anything?

Aloy: Yeah.

Erend: I think there's a cave up there that might get us through that ridge.

Aloy: Let's climb up to it.

[They enter the cave.]

Erend: Ugh. What's in this backpack? Metal tricks?

Kotallo: (via Focus) Aloy… Alva and I are closing in on the Regulator.

Aloy: Keep me posted!

Erend: It's creepy in here.

Aloy: Don't worry, I'll protect you.

[They leave the cave on the other side.]

Aloy: There's a lot of dead machines on this island.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) We killed a great many when we landed here. Their salvage may prove useful to you now.

Aloy: Another Specter. It’s fallen! Thanks for the assist.

Zo: (via Focus) Better than any Oseram.

Aloy: Tired yet?

Erend: Yup. Yeah! Clear those weeds!

Aloy: We're through.

Zo: (via Focus) We can take this one. Aloy, Keep moving!

Aloy: That Stormbird carcass should get us over the gap.

Erend: I hate Stormbirds. But I guess a dead one's handy enough. Remember the good old days when our only worry was whether Meridian would be destroyed? You know, instead of the whole world?

Aloy: Oh, yeah. Good times.

Erend: Ugh. More Specters. I'll attack when you do.

Aloy: Could hit it with Acid. (shooting with a heavy gun) Gave all it got. I think that's all of them - here, at least. Let's push on.

Erend: Any good loot?

Aloy: A little. Here. Up this rock. We're going to have to climb around this corner.

Erend: I’ll try not to complain.

Sylens: (via Focus) I can see the way forward. Keep moving.

Aloy: Going as fast as we can. You all right?

Erend: Sort of. How many Specters do the Zeniths have?

Aloy: More than we want to fight at once that's for sure.

Erend: Got 'em.

Aloy: Looks like the others have things under control. Come on. Up this slab.

Kotallo: (via Focus) Aloy - Alva and I are in position.

Aloy: Do it - blow the regulator.

Kotallo: A moment while lignite the charges…

[They see a blast in the distance.]

Aloy: (via Focus) Alva and Kotallo did their job. Now it's Beta's turn.

[A huge herd of Specters runs near Aloy and Erend.]

Erend: Uh… Aloy… I think we're in trouble.

Sylens: (via Focus) Whatever you plan to do to stop those Specters, you'd better do it now.

Aloy: I'm not doing anything Beta will. She just needs a little time…

Sylens: (via Focus) Time that we don't have.

Aloy: Come on Beta, come on, come on, come on…

[Suddenly the usual machines appear. They attack the Specters.]

Erend: What is that?

Aloy: Our army.

Erend: I think you got their attention!

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Very clever. You had Beta inject HEPHAESTUS into the base's printer matrix.

Sylens: (via Focus) …which is faster and more powerful than any Cauldron.

Aloy: And now it can crank out machines to its heart's content. Come on. Let's get to the launch tower before this whole place becomes a warzone.

Sylens: (via Focus) Your maneuver, as clever as it is, means that HEPHAESTUS has escaped containment. lt will no doubt flee back to the Cauldron network.

Aloy: We grabbed it once we'll get it again.

Sylens: (via Focus) Or find a way to replicate its functionality, perhaps? With the APOLLO database.

Erend: Aloy, in case we don't make it. I just have one regret.

Aloy: What is it?

Erend: That we had to do all this climbing.

Aloy: That big rock might give us a bridge to get up and through.

Erend: Gotcha.

Aloy: Plasma will do a lot of damage here.

Erend: Zo'n baldy are fighting another Specter up there.

Aloy: I think they can handle it.

Erend: Come on. Let's cross over.

Aloy: This way.

Erend: Big jump! To the right I think.

Aloy: And now to the left.

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) You can get to the launch tower through the hangar up ahead. I'm heading over to join you now.

Zo: (via Focus) The hangar's in bad shape, but can see the way in. Hurry, Aloy.

Erend: Another one!

Aloy: Good work, everyone. Let's go.

Zo: Over here, Aloy! This way!

Erend: Whoa… Look at all this Zenith… space stuff. This place is gonna come down around our ears.

Sylens: All the more reason for speed.

Erend: Says the guy who doesn't have to carry much.

Sylens: They'll come for us. Have no doubt.

Alva: (via Focus) Aloy. It's been… intense But Kotallo got me to a network node. I'm trying to get in.

Aloy: Keep at it. We’re almost to the tower.

[However, no sooner do they reach the tower than eight Zenith, led by Gerard, fly out of it.]

Gerard: Ah. Now we know who's been causing all the fuss… …Tilda's little pet.

Aloy: Sylens - Zeniths inbound. Can we drop their shields, please?

Sylens: I'm powering it up. (to Erend) Stay still.

Gerard: This is pointless. You can't hurt us. Face it - you're worms that oozed through the cracks into our basement.

Aloy: Sylens…

Sylens: One moment more…

Gerard: But I might just spare you if you give up Tilda. I think it's safe to say she's forfeited her share of our operation - permanently.

Sylens: Ah. There.

Gerard: No? Nothing? Fine. All right people - light em up!

[Silence throws his mine-like device into the Zenith crowd. It sparks a little.]

Erik: Are we supposed to be scared?

[The mine starts glowing and explodes in a violet wave destroying the shields of Zeniths. They're shocked. Machines attack the Zeniths and kill a few of them. Gerard and Erik fly away. Tilda flies to Aloy.]

Tilda van der Meer: We can't let Gerard escape. It won't take long before he preps the shuttle for launch. Then he'll be able to take Beta and GAIA into orbit and onto the Odyssey, beyond our reach.

Erend: We gotta go through there?

[It is a real war of machines going on down in the plains.]

Sylens: I fail to see another option.

Erend: Then we'll carve a path. Ready?

[And they jump into this ocean of violence and run forth trying not to die.]

Tilda van der Meer: Get to the top and secure GAIA. I'll stop Gerard. (flies away)

[Aloy runs straight to the tower.]

Aloy: I gotta get to the top of the tower and free Beta.

Kotallo: (via Focus) Aloy, we're - DIE MACHINE FILTH! Apologies for that. We’re okay - as long as Alva hurries!

Alva: (via Focus) I'm almost into the network!

Aloy: Just do the best you can! Okay, an elevator. Promising.

[But Erik attacks her from behind and pushes her away.]


Erik: We've got some unfinished business, little girl. 

[He lowers the elevator to the basement, making an improvised arena, after which grabs Aloy by the neck.]

Erik: I don't need a shield to take you out.

Aloy: Trust me, you're gonna wish you had one.

[They start fighting.]

Aloy: Give it a rest first. Till I get my stamina back. Felt that didn't ya?

Zo: (via Focus) Aloy, are you there? I'm on my way to help. Just need to find my way in there…

Aloy: Not much without your shield are ya? Take that! Still in this fight. He’s almost down! Oh, don't like that do ya?

[Aloy defeats Erik. He falls to his knees before her.]

Erik: I almost forgot what it was like to hurt.

[Zo approaches with her spear ready. She pierces Erik through.]

Zo: Now we're having fun, right?

Aloy: You okay?

Zo: I will be, in time. Go. Rescue your sister. I’ll regroup with the others and make sure they’re all right.

[Aloy goes up on the elevator.]

Aloy: Looks like the machines and Specters have almost wiped each other out. What was that?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) Aloy - Gerard just activated the self-destruct failsafe on the printing matrix. He's taking control of a number of systems…

Aloy: Including the lift?

Tilda van der Meer: (via Focus) I'm afraid so. He's restricted its access to the top. You'll have to climb from there. I have to go - I almost have him.

Aloy: Erend, is everyone all right down there?

Erend: (via Focus) Mostly. We're cleaning up the last few Specters.

Aloy: What about the Zeniths?

Erend: Dead, I think. Zo told me you got Erik. Good work.

Aloy: Yeah. Thanks. I guess only Tilda and Gerard are left, then.

Alva: (via Focus) Aloy, you there? Listen - I got into the network, but only for a minute before I was shut out. I found a bunch of flight plans and trajectories. As if the Zeniths were planning to leave Earth.

Aloy: That doesn't make sense…

Alva: (via Focus) I know! But there's more. The files I found have a lot of references to something called "nemesis." Whatever it is. the Zeniths are afraid of it.

Aloy: Alva? Alva? What's going on here? Maybe Beta can help me figure it out. If she's okay…

[She continues climbing.]

Aloy: I'm almost there. This is it. End of the line.

[She enters the meeting room on the top of the tower. Beta sits in one of the chairs connected with copper-looking soft wires. Aloy cuts the wires with her spear.]

Aloy: Are you okay? Look I know you've been through a lot, but you have to help me access the Zenith network. I need to see their files - anything referring to the word "nemesis."

Beta: Okay - over there. 

[She slowly walks to a spherical floating computer, probably an iMac.]

Beta: Systems are down all over the base. I should be able to take advantage of… yes - "nemesis." Here. There's something in deep space. It's following the Zeniths to Earth.

[The iMac projects two spheres - our Earth and the other, two times bigger.]

Aloy: Look - "escape vectors." Alva tried to warn me about this. The Zeniths aren't planning to stay here.

Beta: It's a machine of some kind. Or a swarm of them. The energy readings are… astronomical. Aloy - I don't think a natural disaster destroyed the Zenith's colony on Sirius. This thing did.

Aloy: Earth isn't a new home for them. It's a way station. They're on the run.

[Suddenly Gerard flies into the room thrown by an inhuman force. Tilda enters and finishes Gerard with a baster shot.]

Tilda van der Meer: I see you've been busy.

Aloy: And you've been lying. Nemesis - what is it?

Tilda van der Meer: It is us. The minds of Far Zenith. Or failed copies of them, anyway. Back on Sirius, some of my peers weren't satisfied with physical immortality. They wanted digital transcendence, a way to upload their minds into any form organic or mechanical. Nemesis was a failed experiment to that effect, abandoned - but never erased. An immense database of our memories, emotions, and prejudices left to fester.

Aloy: And it destroyed your colony?

Tilda van der Meer: We didn't realize it had gained sentience until it broke containment. It had everything it needed from our memories. Security protocols. Systems specs. Override codes. It hacked everything before we knew what hit us. Then it took over our printing facilities, allowing it to gain any machine form it needed to wipe us out.

Aloy: But why?

Tilda van der Meer: Imagine being trapped alone for decades, with only the twisted echoes of megalomaniacs for company. It hates us for abandoning it to that prison. And now that it's free, it will do anything to destroy us including denying us a safe harbor on Earth.

Beta: The extinction signal that woke HADES. You didn't send it. Nemesis did.

Tilda van der Meer: Finally you understand. And when that failed it launched from Sirius to finish the job itself. Which is why we must flee to a random planet circling a random star - somewhere it can never find us.

Aloy: With GAIA. So you can build yourself a new world.

Tilda van der Meer: That's the plan. Even now. Earth is finished, Aloy. Nemesis will scour it of life to deny its creators a viable home. But Elisabet's dream won't die. You'll come with me to the stars. And with GAIA, we'll create a new world, together, where that monstrosity can never find us.

Aloy: What? No.

Tilda van der Meer: I loved Elisabet more than you could ever know. And I let her stay behind to die with the rest of humanity - a mistake I have regretted for a thousand years. Now, she stands before me again. Not some inferior copy… (Beta lowers her head) …but her best possible self. So I'm not asking - you're coming with me. It may seem harsh now, but you'll forgive me in a few centuries.

Aloy: You can't force me, Tilda. Your shield is gone.

Tilda van der Meer: I have something better. Specter Prime - to me!

Aloy: (to Beta) Take cover! Get to the door!

[Tilda uses Specter Prime as an exoskeleton. Quick and agile, she attacks Aoy.]

Tilda van der Meer: Submit Aloy. You can't win.

Aloy: I've heard that before.

[The fight begins!]


Aloy: I gotta get through all that armor before I can do some damage. I better scan that thing first. I bet that weapon has ammo left. I could use it! Ha! Those gold plates are vulnerable! That thing's fast. I need to get my stamina back first. You're not taking me, Tilda! Ah, it's quick! Well that did something! Damn, need more! Armor's off! A few more hits! Elemental ammo's making a dent in those gold plates!

[At last Specter Prime is defeated. He ejects the Tilda capsule before exploding.]

Aloy: It's over. Why couldn't you just let me choose?

[Tilda is dead inside the capsule.]

Sylens: She tried to take you? And she told you about Nemesis.

Aloy: So you've known all along.

Sylens: From HADES, yes. Along with data on how to circumvent the Zenith's shields. Everything I did to create the rebel army was based on that knowledge - to reach this place, this moment.

Aloy: And you couldn't just tell me?

Sylens: Come now, Aloy. You're the last person to act sensibly in the face of impossible odds. When I learned of Nemesis from HADES, I saw the pieces on the board, and how to play them. And in that same moment, I knew it was a game you would never play. That you would interfere and attempt to save the Tenakth. I was correct to a point. You ruined my plans… but brought your own to fruition. The end result is the same. We're here. And now it's time for me to leave this doomed planet behind. To seize the Odyssey and the APOLLO database… and begin a new chapter in my pursuit of knowledge, one with infinite possibilities. You can join me, if you so desire. You've more than earned your place. Unlike Tilda, I'm extending a polite invitation.

Aloy: You're going to just take off and abandon everything?

[Sylens walks away.]

Aloy: Stay. Help me fight that thing.

Sylens: Perhaps Tilda didn't adequately define the threat. Nemesis can't be stopped. It destroyed a highly advanced Zenith colony in a matter of hours. What hope does this primitive, tribal Earth have? If you brought GAIA. you wouldn't be abandoning life - you'd be saving a seed for a new world. Just as Elisabet did. It's the choice she made - the sacrifice of all that is for the hope of what might be. If she were here, in your place, she would board that shuttle, Aloy.

Erend: Found her!

Zo: Is she hurt?

Erend: Still on her feet!

Kotallo: Thank the Ten.

Aloy: Goodbye, Sylens.

[She returns to her friends.]

Alva: She looks okay!

Kotallo: She looks victorious.

Zo: As always.

Beta: Aloy… you did it!

[Sylens, standing not so far away, looks at them celebrating and sighs.]

Erend: Where's he going?

Aloy: As far away as anyone can go.

Erend: Oh. Are you sure?

[Sylens approaches them.]

Aloy: You're staying?

Sylens: For a time. You people are going to need all the help you can get.

[He leaves.]

Erend: Does anyone else need a drink?

Zo: Not if it's that ale of yours.

Alva: I'd be fine with a nap.

Kotallo: Excellent idea.

Erend: I hope it's really over this time.

[They take a good look at the sunset skies, then return to the base.]

Aloy: (in her room) There's another battle ahead, Elisabet… …very different than the one you fought. It's not about the distant hope of creating a new world… …it's about preserving the one we have. My friends have a new mission to spread the word and ask for help. They've taken it in stride, I think it's because they've always known what I've only just started to understand. That the people of this world have the strength to fight any battle… the ingenuity to solve any problem… …the courage to overcome any obstacle… And the resilience to rise after any setback. As for me - I can't say I'm not afraid. What lies ahead will be harder than anything we've faced before. But I know I can put the fear aside. Because for the first time in my life… …I feel like I'm not alone.

[As she speaks Beta reinstall GAIA on their base.]

THE END
