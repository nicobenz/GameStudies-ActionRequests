PART 1: RIKIMARU


その昔、都の大半を焦土と化し幕府の権威を失墜させた乱あり。

やがてそれは各地ヘと飛び火し、守護代や国人が独立の動きを示し始める、すなわち下克上。

A long time ago, there was a rebellion that turned most of the country into a scorched earth and brought down the authority of the Shogunate.

The rebellion eventually spread to other parts of the country, and the provincial governors and local people began to show signs of independence.




国は幾多にも割れ、 覇権を相争うようになった。
またその裏にて命の炎を燃やす様がいた。
決して表舞台に出ることなく、暗黒の技を身に纏い、影に生き、影に死す者。

The country was divided into many parts, and they began to compete for supremacy.
But behind the scenes, there were those who burned with the fire of life.
Those who never appear on the stage, but embrace the dark arts, live in the shadows, and die in the shadows.



人は彼らを忍と呼ぶ。
People call them Shinobi.



“It is the age of the Warring States. The old shogun has fallen and samurai fight savage battles for the right to hoist their flags over the great castles of Japan. But far from the battlefield, unseen and unheard, a different breed of warriors plied their deadly trade. Born in shadows, they will die as shadows... They are the ninja.”

(We see a few shots of the peaceful Japanese village’s life. Then the camera switches to the young ninja and his teacher.)

???: You have learned much, but I would expect that from one raised childhood to be an Azuma Ninja.

(We learn that the name of the teacher is Azuma Shiunsai, the head of the Azuma Ninja Clan.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Now it is time to complete your training. Come into my house.

The Training Course
(Rikimaru goes through a series of challenges aimed at testing his knowledge of basic ninja skills.)

Grappling hook and jump training:
You must master the art of moving like a ninja. Climb up the stairs and practice as I instruct you. Always be aware of your surroundings. Stop and take a look around. Head towards the marker and perform each exercise a few times before moving on to the next. Let's start with the basics. Take some short steps. Short steps give you precise control as you move. A ninja must remain unseen. Crouch low to the ground to hide from enemies. You must be able to move while concealed. Roll from approached position to pass unseen. A rolling reverse from a crouch lets you change direction with speed and stealth.

Now let's try jumping. Jumping makes you vulnerable so be careful. When you need to go farther, use a big jump. A ninja must use the terrain to his advantage. Practice sliding along the wall underneath the marker. Creep against the wall until you get to the corner. You will then be able to see around it. If you approach the wall that has a ledge within your reach, you can hang down an inch your way along the wall. Practice in the trench. If you come to a wall that you can't climb by jumping, use your Grappling Hook. The Grappling Hook will only catch on edges so be careful. Try throwing your Grappling Hook on top of the stack of wooden boxes underneath the marker. A ninja must be able to move quietly with no wasted movements. Practice stealth, it will save your life.

Swimming Training:
Now begin your water training. First move into deep water where your feet no longer touch bottom. You will start treading water. Using the water phantom technique you can hide in the water. Now dive underwater and begin swimming. Kick gently with your legs to swim slowly. Now try making a quick turn around. Try swimming a little faster. If you establish a good rhythm, it'll be able to glide through the water smoothly. Remember to come up for air or you will run out and you will start losing strength. That's enough swimming for today.

Stealth Kill Training:
Cross the bridge and find your way into the bamboo forest to begin your weapons training. To attack an enemy, first, draw your weapon then launch your attack. Practice on one of the bamboo trees. Remember to put your weapon away when you aren't using it. You can't move quickly with a weapon in your hand. If there are no enemies around - sheath your weapon. The ninja's greatest weapon is not a sharp blade, but a sharp awareness. If you pay close attention, you can tell your enemy is feeling. Move with stealth and see if you can kill the enemies in the woods ahead with a single stroke. A ninja must learn to be sensitive to the flow of Ki around him.

Shuriken Training:
You must master the tools of the ninja. Pick up the shurikens and select them. Take a careful aim at the target and practice by throwing three shurikens. Once again. Once again. Use your tools carefully. They can even be ninjas only true friends.

(Once the training is over, the young ninja goes to his teacher's house.)

Young Ninja: Test my strength, master. I am ready to be a ninja!

Azuma Shiunsai: You are strong, Rikimaru, but you have much to learn before you can be a ninja.

(The teacher pulls the rope and the secret hatch under Rikimaru swings open.)

Rikimaru: Whoa!

(He lands in the depths of a cave.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Come back when you can survive as a ninja!

A Test from the Master
(Now Rikimaru needs to get out of the cave quietly, killing enemies and avoiding traps, like spikes and falling floor tiles.)

(After we manage to get out of the cave, the scene changes, and we see the teacher Shiunsai sitting in a secret cave behind a waterfall. The teacher hands Rikimaru a scroll.)

Azuma Shiunsai: So, you have survived the training. You are now an Azuma Ninja, Rikimaru. But you still have much to learn.

Rikimaru: I’m honored to serve, master Shiunsai.

(The scene changes. The master stands facing the waterfall and holding his hands behind his back, gives his student the first serious task.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Thieves and mountain bandits have joined forces to prey on local farmers. They lurk in an abandoned village. Attack them by daylight then the bandits are gone and the thieves are sleeping.

Rikimaru: Yes, master.

The Gang of Thieves
(Rikimaru cautiously walks through the village carving the thieves while they sleep. In the depths of the village he finds a Shinto shrine where he sees Garan, the leader of thieves throwing knives into a bound woman.)

Woman: Help! No! Please!

Garan: Hahaha! Dance, woman!

Woman: Please, stop!

Garan: I’ll stop when you die!

(He throws another knife, but suddenly Rikimaru appears and parries it with his sword.)

Garan: What?! Who are you?

Rikimaru: The heavens demand retribution and I will deliver it!

(The fight begins. Rikimaru wins.)

Garan: Boran, where are you when I need you?

(Garan dies. The woman crawls on her knees to Rikimaru.)

Woman: Wait, please! Who are you?

Rikimaru: I am a shadow. I have no name!

(Rikimaru disappears with a dramatic jump.)

Treason at Gohda Castle
ACT I: THE RED LOTUS (紅蓮)


武家社会において、代々家督はその実子が受け継ぐ慣わしである。

In samurai society, it is customary for a son to inherit the reigns of the family.
だが、その実権を巡り幾度と無く血で血を洗う骨肉の争いが生まれた。
郷田家もまた例外では無い。
直系松之信が継ぎし事を不服とする叔父の基秀は、松之信に反旗を翻した。
この内乱は郷田家を二分する戦へと発展する。
事態を重くみた筆頭家老、関谷直忠は、陰にて郷田家に遣える東忍流頭領東紫雲斎へ遣いを出した。

However, over the years, bloody fights have arisen over this right. The Gohda family is no exception.

Motohide, the uncle who is unhappy with the succession of Matsunoshin rebels against him.

This civil war divides the Gohda family.

Sekiya Naotada, the first counselor, took the situation seriously and sent an envoy to Azuma Shiunsai, the head of the Azuma Shinobi School, who was working behind the scenes for the Gohda family.
|}


“The senior Lord Gohda’s death launched a vicious struggle for power, a series of battles and betrayals worse than any in Japan’s blood stained history. Now Lord Gohda left all the power and glory of his title, the riches of his empire, to his son Matsunoshin. But Lord Gohda’s brother, a man named Motohide, believed himself to be the empire’s rightful heir. Motohide was able to bribe certain samurai to his side, and immerse the empire into civil war. Gohda family advisor, Sekiya Naotada, responded the only way he could; he called the Azuma Ninja.”

Skilled Ninja: Rikimaru, master Shiunsai calls us.

Rikimaru: On my way.

(They go to the teacher's house, accompanied by a ninja girl.)

Ninja Girl: (giggles) What are you two doing here?

Azuma Shiunsai: My students, rebellion has broken out in the House of Gohda. Our honorable Lord Gohda is in danger from his own Uncle Sire Motohide. If the Lord we serve falls to a dishonorable traitor, we, Azuma ninjas will stand for nothing. Go to Gohda Castle and protect Lord Gohda with your lives. This is the ancestral sword, Izayoi. The spirit of the Azuma Ninja.

(While the teacher speaks we see the names of unknown characters - the girl's name is Ayame, and the guy's name is Tatsumaru.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Tatsumaru, it is yours. Today, you replace me as Master Ninja. May honor guide your hand.

Tatsumaru: Master…

Rikimaru: But…

Ayame: No!

Azuma Shiunsai: The powerful must know when to pass along their power. As you three graduate to new roles, I also ascend.

Rikimaru: Very well.

Tatsumaru: I obey.

Ayame: Yes, master.

(The scene changes, and we see Lord Gohda's castle on fire. A ninja kills an innocent woman... fire, blood and death everywhere. Barely standing woman is trying to leave the castle, but meets our heroes.)

Woman: Please! Don’t kill me!

Rikimaru: It’s okay, we’re here to help.

Woman: Oh thank goodness. His Lordship is still inside; so are Lady Kei and Princess Kiku!

Tatsumaru: Ayame, find Lady Kei and the Princess. Rikimaru, come with me. We must rescue Lord Gohda.

(Next scene. Rikimaru and Tatsumaru run along the wall, but suddenly Tatsumaru notices someone and stops.)

Tatsumaru: Wait, Rikimaru. Go find his Lordship. I’ll catch up later.

(Rikimaru quietly passes through the burning castle of Lord Gohda, carving out the guard. He climbing to the top floor, clinging to the wall and listening to the Gohda's conversation with his uncle.)

Gohda Motohide: The world is torn apart by war! I am the house of Gohda's only hope; the peasants must learn their place!

Gohda Matsunoshin: You’re wrong, Uncle! The people are the soul of this land!

Gohda Motohide: Enough talk! Yah!

(They fight and Gohda Matsunoshin wins, but he lacks the spirit to strike the final blow. Motohide takes out the musket.)

Gohda Motohide: Compassionate fool!

(Motohide shoots. Rikimaru runs into the room.)

Rikimaru: My Lord!

(The fight begins. Rikimaru defeats Gohda Motohide.)

Gohda Motohide: How humiliating! Defeated by a servant.

Rikimaru: Sire Motohide! Prepare to die!

(While Rikimaru swings, Gohda Matsunoshin runs out in slow motion and puts his back under the sword, saving Motorhide. Rikimaru falls to his knees.)

Rikimaru: No...

Gohda Motohide: Hehehe...

(Motohide runs away.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: Identify yourself, ninja.

Rikimaru: Rikimaru of the Azuma Ninja, my Lord.

Gohda Matsunoshin: Ah, Rikimaru, I didn’t recognize you.

Rikimaru: My Lord, I tried to kill the traitor, but I have dishonored myself by striking you.

Gohda Matsunoshin: Nonsense, you did not mean to injure me. My Uncle, he is misguided, but he is trying to save the land.

(A one-eyed samurai with two swords rushes into the room.)

Samurai: Assassin!

Gohda Matsunoshin: Jubei stop! It’s Rikimaru, he saved my life!

Tachibana Jubei: Rikimaru, the ruffian master Shiunsai was training. Hmmm, well you have my thanks, but my Lord, Motohide’s soldiers have broken into the castle! You must flee! Use the secret exit!

Gohda Matsunoshin: I will not leave the castle while my wife and daughter are still here.

Tachibana Jubei: Please my lord, they will kill you!

Rikimaru: Lady Kei and Princess Kiku are in good hands. Ayame went to rescue them. My Lord, what of the people? What will become of them if you die today?

(Several soldiers try to attack the heroes.)

Soldier: DIE!

(Jubei deftly kills them.)

Tachibana Jubei: My lord... I beg you, take the secret passage. Rikimaru — protect him! Go! I can’t hold them off forever.

(The scene changes and we see Rikimaru and Lord Matsunoshin looking at the burning castle. Lord Matsunoshin begins to cry and falls to his knees.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: My castle burns… all is lost… if only these tears can quench the flames.

Rikimaru: My Lord…

Gohda Matsunoshin: What a pathetic being I have become…

(A man is approaching him on a horse.)

Man: Lord Gohda? Are you all right?

Gohda Matsunoshin: Sekiya… I am glad to see you alive.

(The man turns out to be Sekiya Naotada, counselor of old Lord Gohda.)

Sekiya Naotada: You must be Rikimaru, Jubei told me how you saved Lord Gohda’s life. I am in your debt.

Rikimaru: Saved? It is my sword that--

Gohda Matsunoshin: Sekiya… Where are Kei and Kiku?

Sekiya Naotada: Oh… my Lord… They are…

Gohda Matsunoshin: What is it? Tell me!

Sekiya Naotada: My Lord… I regret to inform you… that your wife, Lady Kei… has been killed. And your daughter, Princess Kiku… kidnapped. Ayame is chasing the kidnapper, but my Lord… The kidnapper… The murderer… is your Uncle… Motohide.

Gohda Matsunoshin: What?! Motohide?

Rikimaru: It is my fault, my Lord. I should have been there…

Gohda Matsunoshin: There is no fault of yours, Rikimaru. The blame is mine. And I must bear it… ALONE!

Rikimaru: My Lord…

Sekiya Naotada: My Lord, the enemy has taken advantage of the rebellion to move against us. Toda’s troops have crossed our border! What is your command?

Gohda Matsunoshin: Toda think my Uncle’s treason leave us helpless? I'll kill that coward myself!

(He impotently falls to his knees.)

Rikimaru: I will find Toda, my Lord, and bring you his head!

(Rikimaru takes a few steps back.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: Rikimaru?

Rikimaru: Please, my Lord. If you die this day, sire Motohide will rule.

(Next scene. Rikimaru stands at the entrance to the camp, enduring a strong wind and rain. He speaks to himself.)

Rikimaru: Toda! Your time is at hand!

Lord Toda's War Camp
(The heavy rain worsens the visibility, so Rikimaru has to walk carefully through the camp, killing the soldiers. After walking deep into the camp, he is stopped by a knife thrown under his feet. The owner of the knife, a ninja in a golden mask, jumps off a tall tree.)

Suzaku: I am Suzaku the Red Sparrow. You may not pass beyond this checkpoint.

Rikimaru: Stand aside!

Suzaku: What’s your hurry, hero? Stay and play.

(They fight and Rikimaru wins.)

Suzaku: You're good, little ninja. One day you may actually become a worthy opponent for me.

(Suzaku leaves.)

Rikimaru: Come back! Forget it… I’ve got to stop Toda. I’ll get Suzaku some other day.

(Next scene. Rikimaru goes into the tent and sees the body of Gohda Motohide in a pool of blood.)

Rikimaru: Looks like you paid a high price for your treason, sire Motohide.

(Going a little further he sees another decapitated body.)

Rikimaru: Toda! Who did this to him? Ayame? No… Such a clean cut. Must've been Tatsumaru.

(Rikimaru hears clanging of swords and runs out of the tents.)

(The camera switches to Ayame, carrying a little girl. She also hears the sound of swords.)

Ayame: Oh, no!

(We see Tatsumaru fighting with some ninja women. Rikimaru runs to Ayame.)

Ayame: Rikimaru, protect Princess Kiku!

(Cutscene: Tatsumaru fights a ninja woman at the top of the cliff. Ayame ran to him. Suddenly, part of the rock breaks off. Tatsumaru along with a female ninja falls into the sea.)

Ayame: Tatsumaru!

(Ayame lying on the edge of the rock, looks sadly at the sea. A ribbon from Tatsumaru's clothes is floating on the water.)

ACT II: THE SHIFTING SANDS (流砂 / Quicksand)

“Three months have passed. Gohda Castle was saved by a well-timed rain shower, just as the House of Gohda was saved by the Azuma Ninja. While loyal subjects repair the castle, Lord Gohda recovers from his wounds in the Azuma Ninja village. All seems well… but the villager's heart is heavy, for there has been no news of Tatsumaru...”

Gohda Matsunoshin: Terrible news from one of our mountain villagers. People are disappearing. The terrified villagers whisper that demons have come for them. Go there. And stop this tragedy.

Rikimaru: As you command, my Lord.

The Demon Mountain
(Next scene. The camera focuses on the monkey, and then moves on to the villager running away from a gangster wearing a demon mask with a long nose.)

Villager: Hey! Somebody, help me!

Masked Bandit: Go ahead and scream! We're in the middle of nowhere! Ain’t nobody gonna hear ya... or care!

Villager: Please!!! Somebody!!!

Masked Bandit: Hahaha!!!

(The bandit knocks down the villager and puts him on his shoulder.)

Rikimaru: You're a pretty sad excuse for a demon!

Masked Bandit: Who are you?

Rikimaru: I am the man who will cut off your nose. At the neck.

(The bandit throws the villager and leaps into the mountains.)

(Rikimaru climbs the mountains and kills the bandits. After a while, he finds a small hut.)

Villager: Oh, thank you! Thank you!

Villager: Here, you might need this.

(Suddenly, a bandit with two sickles attacked from above and struck the villager. His name is Kamadoma. He’s a the ninja leader of the bandits of the Burning Dawn.)

Kamadoma: Hahaha! That’ll teach you to run away, peasant!

Rikimaru: You coward! He had no weapon!

Kamadoma: Hahahaha! He’s a peasant! An insect!

Rikimaru: Insect is better than you, murderer!

(The battle begins. Rikimaru wins.)

Kamadoma: Hahahaha! Ohhhh…

(Rikimaru cuts his throat.)

Rikimaru: You shall die in silence!

(Next scene. Rikimaru approaches the dying villager, who hands him an envelope.)

Villager: Take… Take this.

Rikimaru: What is it?

Villager: The map that shows the secret harbor… Please, save our village!

(The villager dies.)

Rikimaru: Your death will not be in vain. I, Rikimaru, swear it. I’ve got to save those villagers!

(The scene changes. Night. Rikimaru walks down a narrow mountain pass, sees several soldiers with spears.)

Rikimaru: What is that?

The Secret Harbor
(Rikimaru explores the harbor, simultaneously killing ordinary soldiers with a spear and new enemies - soldiers with rifles. Having got through the guards, Rikimaru gets on a ship in which he finds the missing villagers.)

Villager: Thank you for saving us!

Rikimaru: Hurry! Get out of here!

(From the next cabin comes Wang Xiaohai, the leader of the Baoliusung Gang.)

Wang Xiaohai: Rude person! In China guests not leave without thanking the hosts!

Rikimaru: Ah, but you’re my guest while you’re in Japan. And YOU have overstayed your welcome!

(The battle begins. Rikimaru defeats Wang.)

Wang Xiaohai: (cough) Defeated… By a barbarian dog… I’m sorry, father…

(Wang Xiaohai dies.)

(After a while Rikimaru is attacked by a masked ninja. They exchange a couple of short blows.)

Rikimaru: Who are you?

(The masked ninja takes out his sword.)

Rikimaru: That blade… It’s Izayoi!

(The masked ninja takes off the mask.)

Rikimaru: Tatsumaru! You’re alive!

Ninja: Who’s Tatsumaru? I am Seiryu the Blue Dragon! One of the four Lords of the Burning Dawn!

(Seiryu attacks Rikimaru.)

Rikimaru: Burning Dawn? What are you talking about? You’re Tatsumaru, leader of the Azuma Ninja.

Seiryu: I have no time to talk to a mad man.

Rikimaru: Tatsumaru! It’s me, Rikimaru!

(Seiryu jumps and disappears.)

(Next scene. Rikimaru is talking with his teacher, Shiunsai.)

Azuma Shiunsai: So, Tatsumaru survived the fall… Hmm…

Rikimaru: But how could the enemy trick him into joining them?

Azuma Shiunsai: Tatsumaru would never fall to a simple trick! There are unseen forces at work.

Rikimaru: Master, could it be that he’s forgotten who he is?

Azuma Shiunsai: Even if that is so, we still bear the responsibility for his actions. If he has dishonored himself only death at hands of an Azuma Ninja will purify him. You must be prepared to kill him.

(Lord Gohda Matsunoshin enters the house.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: Shiunsai! The temple has been overrun… some group called The Burning Dawn…

Rikimaru: Burning Dawn?

Gohda Matsunoshin: You’ve heard of them?

Rikimaru: I…

Azuma Shiunsai: Rikimaru… Your answers lie within the temple. Go now and find the truth!

Gohda Matsunoshin: Hurry. We’re counting on you.

Rikimaru: Yes, my Lord!

(Next scene. Rikimaru runs to the temple.)

Rikimaru: I’ll get answers alright. With cold steel.

(Next scene. We see night views of the temple and its guards.)

Rikimaru: OK, Burning Dawn! Time for some answers!

The Temple of Dreams
(Rikimaru destroys the guards of the temple, moving mostly under the water. After a while, he finds a small area and swims on it.)

Rikimaru: Suzaku! I told you I’d catch you!

Suzaku: Span!

(All the openings on the court are tightly closed, and a pale girl in a traditional Japanese suit walks down the stairs. This is Yukihotaru, the Ice Firefly, the Burning Dawn female ninja.)

Yukihotaru: Let me kill the child ninja for you, my love.

(The battle begins and Rikimaru wins. Yukihotaku lies in a pool of her own blood.)

Yukihotaru: Su… Suzaku… Hold me… I’m dying…

(Suzaku mercilessly pierce the dying Yukihotaru with his sword.)

Yukihotaru: Suzaku! My love! How could you!

(Yukihotaru dies.)

Suzaku: I have no love for weakness! Only power!

(Rikimaru looks at him with hatred, ready for battle.)

Suzaku: So… We meet again. I am Suzaku the Red Sparrow. One of the four Lords of the Burning Dawn.

(Suzaku takes off his mask. We see a blindfold of his eyes - apparently he is blind.)

Rikimaru: Burning Dawn? What have you done to Tatsumaru?

Suzaku: There is no Tatsumaru. Only Seiryu the Blue Dragon. And we’ve done nothing to him. He chose to throw off the shackle of his old life.

Rikimaru: You lie! Tatsumaru would never--

Suzaku: Believe what you will, but know this. The Tatsumaru you know is dead. Hahaha!

Rikimaru: No!

Suzaku: Yees! Will you join Tatsumaru and help him create a nation of ninja?

Rikimaru: Nation of ninja?

Suzaku: The era of samurai lordship is over. Now dawn's the age of the ninja! We will rule the world!

Rikimaru: But… Countless thousands will have to die!

Suzaku: We live in a world at war. People die every day.

(Suzaku kills a firefly with a single, fast movement of his sword.)

Suzaku: But enough arguing. You will join us… eventually. Because you are just like me – a lone wolf, who finds meaning only in the clash of steel on steel, right?

Rikimaru: I--

Suzaku: And besides… soon you will have no one else to turn.

Rikimaru: What do you mean?

Suzaku: You find out soon enough. Hahahaha.

(He leaves.)

Rikimaru: You’re not getting away this time!

(He runs after Suzaku, but he’s already gone. A moment later a mail pigeon flies to Rikimaru and pins him about something.)

Rikimaru: Ninja village? Under attack?! It can’t be!

(Next scene. Rikimaru runs into the village. Fire and death all over. Rikimaru sees a ninja woman killing an old man.)

Old man: Ri… Rikimaru…

(The old man dies.)

Rikimaru: You call yourself a ninja?! Your crimes are unforgivable!

Woman Ninja: You must be Rikimaru. A young man who’s been so busy interfering with my great work.

Rikimaru: Great work? Destroying the ninja?!

Woman Ninja: I’m the savior of the ninja! I’m Kagami, the leader of the Burning Dawn!

Rikimaru: What kind of savior slaughters innocent people?

Kagami: The path I take is not important. Only my success. And you’re in the way of that success, young Rikimaru! First the mountain village, then my secret harbor… (tut-tut)

Rikimaru: If you’re angry with me, why attack this village?

Kagami: Hah, I’m not angry at all! Haha. I’ve mastered my passions. I can be selfless in service to my dream… Now I know… I did it to touch the world less on me. Oppose me and watch you loved ones suffer!

(Next scene. Rikimaru breaks the door to Azuma Shiunsai's house, killing a soldier, while Shiunsai and Lord Gohda Matsunoshin, fighting back to back, killing their opponents.)

Rikimaru: My master! My Lord! I’m glad to see you both safe.

Azuma Shiunsai: Rikimaru! I’ll protect Lord Gohda. You must save the villagers.

Rikimaru: Yes, master.

Ninja Village Under Attack
(The soldiers of the Burning Dawn flooded the ninja village. Rikimaru mercilessly kills all of them, then he hears the scream of his teacher.)

Rikimaru: Master!

(When he arrives at Shiunsai's house, he finds his teacher and Lord Gohda dead, and their killer... Seiryu. Rikimaru takes out a sword. Seiryu takes his own.)

Rikimaru: Tatsumaru! You have betrayed your clan and your family! You will DIE!

(Seiryu does not use weapons, and after a few strikes, the fight ends. Seiryu falls to the ground and Rikimaru swings for the final blow.)

Rikimaru: Tatsumaru… prepare to DIE!

Seiryu: What’s wrong with you? Do it!

Rikimaru: I… I can’t…

(Rikimaru swings the sword, but the blow does not reach the target. As Rikimaru hesitates, Seiryu takes out his sword and is about to strike. Rikimaru has every chance to repel the blow, but takes away the weapon and turns away, resulting in a scar on his right eye. We hear a scream from outside of the house and a corpse of an old man crushing in, breaking the wall. In the formed opening we see Kagami.)

Kagami: Never start a fight you’re not prepared to finish, boy.

Rikimaru: YOU!

Kagami: Seiryu? We’re leaving.

Seiryu: Yes.

Rikimaru: You’re not going anywhere!

(Rikimaru tries to attack Kagami, but she easily repels his blow.)

Kagami: Your anger betrays you. You cannot conquer me if you cannot conquer your feelings. You didn’t kill Seiryu, so I would spare you. Listen carefully, Rikimaru… A new day is dawning. Conquer your emotions, attain selflessness and then I let you join us.

(Kagami and Seiryu leave.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Rik… Rikimaru…

Rikimaru: Master Shiunsai!

Azuma Shiunsai: Rikimaru! You must recover the sword, Izayoi. The fate of the Azuma Clan is now in your hands.

Rikimaru: Yes, Master.

Azuma Shiunsai: Wait! When you face Tatsumaru, you must not be ruled by vengeance or anger. You must be in a state of selflessness or you will fail again.

Rikimaru: Master?

Azuma Shiunsai: I… (coughs) I only prepared you for physical combat. You have not yet mastered the warfare of the spirit! Forgive me!

(Master Shiunsai dies.)

Rikimaru: Master…

(The scene changes. We see Lord Gohda riding a horse. Apparently he survived the attack and only fainted. Next to him is his father's adviser, Sekiya Naotada.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: I must return to the castle! The Burning Dawn will attack again. But they cannot catch me unprepared this time!

(Lord Gohda leaves. Sekiya follows him.)

(Rikimaru looks at Shunsai's burning house. Semimaru, Azuma's dog-ninja, runs up to him.)

Semimaru: Woof, woof!

Rikimaru: Semimaru! I’m so glad you’re okay! Good dog! Okay, boy, find Tatsumaru. Find Tatsumaru!

Semimaru: (howls)

(The scene changes. Rikimaru, along with Semimaru, finds Ayame sitting by the tree.)

Rikimaru: Ayame? Tatsumaru killed master Shiunsai. I must avenge his DEATH!

(Quick as lightning Ayame pulls her blades out of the sheath and puts them to the throat of Rikimaru.)

Ayame: I won't let you kill Tatsumaru.

Rikimaru: Ayame! I must! He killed the master!

Ayame: No… I will kill Tatsumaru myself!

Rikimaru: What? But… Oh, I see… You’re not seeking vengeance. You act from a state of pure selflessness. Come on, Semimaru! Take us to Tatsumaru!

Semimaru: Woof, woof!

In Pursuit of Tatsumaru
(Semimaru leads the heroes into the bamboo forest and runs forward. Rikimaru cautiously makes his way through the forest. The forest is thickened and he hardly sees his enemies. Finally, he, along with Ayame, catches up with Semimaru.)

Rikimaru: Come out! Show yourself!

???: Your senses are chapped for your maneuver. I’m Byakko, the White Tiger, one of the four Lords of the Burning Dawn. What’s that? I agree! (to Ayame) Rejoice, woman! You speaking liking to me… (to Semimaru) You have the honor of being eaten by Chiro the Magnificent! (to Rikimaru) As for you… unsavory man… you will have settled to kill by me!

(The battle begins. Rikimaru kills Byakko.)

Byakko: May Chiro pick your bones clean!

(Byakko dies.)

Rikimaru: I guess you weren't so ferocious after all.

Semimaru: (howls)

(Semimaru leads the heroes into the cave. He barks, indicating direction.)

Rikimaru: So Tatsumaru in this cave? Good boy! Now, Semimaru, you stay here.

Semimaru: Woof, woof!

Ayame: I’m going in!

(The heroes leave. Semimaru sadly whines as they go.)

The Kansen Caverns
(Rikimaru has to use all his skill, since there are a lot of pitfalls in the cave. He stops deep into the cave, noticing something unusual.)

Rikimaru: What... is... that?

(He notices a huge structure in the depths of the cave. Ayame peeks out from behind the boxes and signs him up to sign them, they are hiding behind the boxes together, Seiryu and Kagami are standing at the entrance to the structure.)

Kagami: Seiryu… It’s almost finished… The most powerful warship in history! Finally, my dreams become real!

Seiryu: A world ruled by a ninja.

Kagami: Exactly! We no longer be forced to hide in the night like thieves, we will decide how we live. And how we die!

(One of the ninja soldiers runs up to Kagami.)

Ninja Soldier: Lady Kagami!

Kagami: Stop shouting! I’m talking to Seiryu.

Ninja Soldier: I’m sorry, Lady Kagami.

Kagami: What do you want?

Ninja Soldier: There is an intruder in the cave. Probably an Azuma Ninja.

Kagami: Great… It's all we need… Listen up! We’re moving up a schedule forward! Prepare to launch the ship immediately! Our first target – Gohda Castle!

Ninja Soldier: Yes, my Lady.

Kagami: Seiryu… Do you know why we are going to destroy Gohda’s Castle?

(Everyone froze in anticipation of her reply.)

Kagami: Our soul purpose in life has been to serve in the endless war between Toda and Gohda! But now… Toda is gone. Gohda is the only thing standing between us and freedom! If we are ever to cast chains off that’ve shackled our spirits for generations, then Gohda must be destroyed! No matter that the cost! Now come on! It's time to board the Fire Demon. We stand at the dawn of a new era.

(Kagami and Seiryu leave. We return to our heroes.)

Rikimaru: I run to the castle. You stay with the ship!

Ayame: Agreed!

ACT III: SOLITUDE (幽玄 / Mystery)

“After running day and night, Rikimaru reaches Gohda Castle before the Fire Demon. Lord Gohda calls an emergency meeting of the nobles of the House of Gohda.”

Gohda Matsunoshin: We need to find a way to stop the Burning Dawn and their giant warship!

Noble 1: Our troops cannot fight it from land… Maybe we should send our fleet…

Noble 2: Our boats are too small and will be blown to bits if they come near the Fire Demon…

Sekiya Naotada: Enough! You talk as if we’re already lost, before the battle has even begun! Have you forgotten that you are warriors…

(The bell rang.)

Rikimaru: They're here!

(Cutscene: A huge ship appears from behind the rocks along with a dozen of small ships, colossally inferior to it in size. The ship comes closer and starts firing its massive cannon, destroying the upper level of the castle.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: I will lead the assault on the enemy myself. Prepare my ship!

Rikimaru: Lord Gohda! I am going to board the enemy ship. I’ll come back with Kagami’s head!

Gohda Matsunoshin: Take care of yourself, Rikimaru. You’re too valuable to lose. I’ll see you then it’s all over.

Rikimaru: Yes, my Lord…

The Sea Battle
(Rikimaru scuffs among a multitude of ships, trying not to hurt the soldiers of Gohda and on one of the ships he is met by an old enemy.)

Suzaku: Intoxicating, isn’t it?

Rikimaru: What?

Suzaku: The copper smell of blood. The screams of dying men… that final moment of flesh as you die. Only servants of darkness can appreciate these… I should deliver you from your darkness… to that pure light!

Rikimaru: Not if I enlighten you first!

(The battle begins. Rikimaru defeats Suzaku.)

Suzaku: You lose. Because the more enemies you get revenge on, the angrier and nastier you’ve become. Until you’ve become vicious and selfish as... me! Hahahaha!

(Suzaku dies.)

Rikimaru: I’ve no longer seek vengeance, I nearly serve a worthy master. I fight because I must.

(The mission continues. Rikimaru gets on the Fire Demon and begins searching for his main enemy. He soon finds Ayame.)

(Rikimaru sees Ayame wiping his blades after Seiryu's assassination.)

Rikimaru: Ayame…

(Ayame throws Rikimaru the main relic of the Azuma clan - the Izayoi sword. Rikimaru remembers the past events.)

(Next scene. We see Kagami, dressed in traditional Japanese clothes and wearing a mask, dancing on a small pedestal. Rikimaru approaches her.)

Kagami: So... Seiryu is dead... I’ll think you’ve never gotten this far. Rikimaru? Will you really put an end to my beautiful dream?

(Kagami removes traditional Japanese clothes in one movement, revealing armor.)

Rikimaru: You… killed the beauty of your dream with the ugliness of your methods…

(The battle begins. Kagami uses only the Japanese fan to defend himself and misses blow after blow. In while she throws out her fan and takes out her sword. The fight begins for life or death, but Rikimaru still manages to win.)

(Kagami falls to the floor, her sword rolls away. She's dying.)

Kagami: You think you have destroyed my dream? By killing me? Ha! But my dream lives! You cannot stop it from becoming true, because… we will pay any price for freedom! But you… you're only a fool! Follow the rules without questioning them. And fools can never stop us!

Rikimaru: Huh, I'll happily suffer the title of fool if it means I can save even ONE life from your blood-drenched dream! Farewell, Kagami…

(The scene changes. Rikimaru kneels before his lord, Lord Gohda.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: Rikimaru! Everything is taken care of?

Rikimaru: Yes, sir!

Gohda Matsunoshin: But where is Ayame?

Rikimaru: She wasn’t on the boat.

(Lord Gohda turns away to give an order.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: Archers! Prepare flaming arrows!

(The archers shoot at the "Fire Demon", setting it on fire. The fire reaches for gunpowder, an explosion takes place, and the characters observe it from the shore.)

(The final cutscene. Ayame sits on top of a mountain at a grave made of stones. Rikimaru approaches her.)

Rikimaru: Ayame, you made it!

Ayame: I have become strong, so no one have ever take away anything I care for.

Rikimaru: I understand.

(Rikimaru is about to leave.)

Ayame: What will you do now?

Rikimaru: I wish only to serve Lord Gohda.

(Rikimaru leaves, but Ayame catches up with him.)

Ayame: Good. I’m going with you to Gohda Castle.

Rikimaru: I’m glad.

Ayame: I’ve someone there worth dying for… and worth living for.

(A beautiful seagull flies past the heroes.)

THE END

PART 2: AYAME


その昔、都の大半を焦土と化し幕府の権威を失墜させた乱あり。

やがてそれは各地ヘと飛び火し、守護代や国人が独立の動きを示し始める、すなわち下克上。

A long time ago, there was a rebellion that turned most of the country into a scorched earth and brought down the authority of the Shogunate.

The rebellion eventually spread to other parts of the country, and the provincial governors and local people began to show signs of independence.




国は幾多にも割れ、 覇権を相争うようになった。
またその裏にて命の炎を燃やす様がいた。
決して表舞台に出ることなく、暗黒の技を身に纏い、影に生き、影に死す者。

The country was divided into many parts, and they began to compete for supremacy.
But behind the scenes, there were those who burned with the fire of life.
Those who never appear on the stage, but embrace the dark arts, live in the shadows, and die in the shadows.



人は彼らを忍と呼ぶ。
People call them Shinobi.



“It is the age of the Warring States. The old shogun has fallen and samurai fight savage battles for the right to hoist their flags over the great castles of Japan. But far from the battlefield, unseen and unheard, a different breed of warriors plied their deadly trade. Born in shadows, they will die as shadows... They are the ninja.”

(We see a few shots of the peaceful Japanese village’s life. Then the camera switches to the young ninja and her teacher.)

???: You’ve learned much, but I would expect that from one raised childhood to be an Azuma Ninja.

(We learn that the name of the teacher is Azuma Shiunsai, the head of the Azuma Ninja Clan.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Now it is time to complete your training. Come into my house.

The Training Course
(Ayame goes through a series of challenges aimed at testing her knowledge of basic ninja skills.)

Grappling hook and jump training:
You must master the art of moving like a ninja. Climb up the stairs and practice as I instruct you. Always be aware of your surroundings. Stop and take a look around. Head towards the marker and perform each exercise a few times before moving on to the next. Let's start with the basics. Take some short steps. Short steps give you precise control as you move. A ninja must remain unseen. Crouch low to the ground to hide from enemies. You must be able to move while concealed. Roll from approached position to pass unseen. A rolling reverse from a crouch lets you change direction with speed and stealth.

Now let's try jumping. Jumping makes you vulnerable so be careful. When you need to go farther, use a big jump. A ninja must use the terrain to his advantage. Practice sliding along the wall underneath the marker. Creep against the wall until you get to the corner. You will then be able to see around it. If you approach the wall that has a ledge within your reach, you can hang down an inch your way along the wall. Practice in the trench. If you come to a wall that you can't climb by jumping, use your Grappling Hook. The Grappling Hook will only catch on edges so be careful. Try throwing your Grappling Hook on top of the stack of wooden boxes underneath the marker. A ninja must be able to move quietly with no wasted movements. Practice stealth, it will save your life.

Swimming Training:
Now begin your water training. First move into deep water where your feet no longer touch bottom. You will start treading water. Using the water phantom technique you can hide in the water. Now dive underwater and begin swimming. Kick gently with your legs to swim slowly. Now try making a quick turn around. Try swimming a little faster. If you establish a good rhythm, it'll be able to glide through the water smoothly. Remember to come up for air or you will run out and you will start losing strength. That's enough swimming for today.

Stealth Kill Training:
Cross the bridge and find your way into the bamboo forest to begin your weapons training. To attack an enemy, first, draw your weapon then launch your attack. Practice on one of the bamboo trees. Remember to put your weapon away when you aren't using it. You can't move quickly with a weapon in your hand. If there are no enemies around - sheath your weapon. The ninja's greatest weapon is not a sharp blade, but a sharp awareness. If you pay close attention, you can tell your enemy is feeling. Move with stealth and see if you can kill the enemies in the woods ahead with a single stroke. A ninja must learn to be sensitive to the flow of Ki around him.

Shuriken Training:
You must master the tools of the ninja. Pick up the shurikens and select them. Take a careful aim at the target and practice by throwing three shurikens. Once again. Once again. Use your tools carefully. They can even be ninjas only true friends.

(Once the training is over, the young ninja goes to her teacher's house.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Are you ready, Ayame?

Ayame: I was born ready!

Azuma Shiunsai: Hah. We shall see.

(The teacher pulls the rope and the secret hatch under Ayame swings open.)

Ayame: Ah!

(She lands in the depths of a cave.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Come back when you can survive as a ninja!

A Test from the Master
(Now Ayame needs to get out of the cave quietly, killing enemies and avoiding traps, like spikes and falling floor tiles.)

(After we manage to get out of the cave, the scene changes, and we see the master Shiunsai sitting in a secret cave behind a waterfall. The teacher hands Ayame a scroll.)

Azuma Shiunsai: So, you’ve survived the training. You are now an Azuma Ninja, Ayame. But you still have much to learn.

Ayame: That’s great! I mean... thank you for the honor.

(The scene changes. The master stands facing the waterfall and holding his hands behind his back, gives his student the first serious task.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Mountain bandits are hiding in an abandoned village near here. Then the night falls you must chase the bandits away.

Ayame: But... Master? Bandits? They are filthy! Have you ever smelled one? Eek!

Azuma Shiunsai: Ayame...

Ayame: Just kidding... I’m going.

The Mountain Bandits
(Ayame cautiously walks through the village at night carving the bandits. In the depths of the village she sees a bulky man riding a horse.)

???: Ho-ho-ho! Look here! A pretty little flower among the weeds!

(Soon we learn the name of the man. It's Boron, the leader of bandits.)

Ayame: You’re the head idiot around here, aren’t you?

Boron: I’m the mighty Boron, I lead the mountain bandits.

Ayame: Knew it.

Boron: Ha! How?

Ayame: I’ll tell you in a minute!

(The fight begins. Ayame wins.)

Ayame: I knew you had to be in charge because you stink worse than the others!

ACT I: THE RED LOTUS (紅蓮)

“The senior Lord Gohda’s death launched a vicious struggle for power, a series of battles and betrayals worse than any in Japan’s blood stained history. Now Lord Gohda left all the power and glory of his title, the riches of his empire, to his son Matsunoshin. But Lord Gohda’s brother, a man named Motohide, believed himself to be the empire’s rightful heir. Motohide was able to bribe certain samurai to his side, and immerse the empire into civil war. Gohda family advisor, Sekiya Naotada, responded the only way he could; he called the Azuma Ninja.”

Ayame: (giggles) What are you two doing here?

Azuma Shiunsai: My students! Rebellion are broken out in the house of Gohda. Our honorable lord Gohda is in danger from his own uncle, sire Motohide. If the lord we serve falls to a dishonorable traitor, we, the Azuma Ninja, will stand for nothing. Go to Gohda Castle and protect lord Gohda with your lives. This is the ancestral sword, Izayoi. The spirit of the Azuma Ninja.

(While the teacher speaks we see the names of unknown characters - the ninja with white hairs is Rikimaru, and the beefy guy's name is Tatsumaru.)

Azuma Shiunsai: Tatsumaru, it is yours. Today, you replace me as Master Ninja. May honor guide your hand.

Tatsumaru: Master…

Rikimaru: But…

Ayame: No!

Azuma Shiunsai: The powerful must know when to pass along their power. As you three graduate to new roles, I also ascend.

Rikimaru: Very well.

Tatsumaru: I obey.

Ayame: Yes, master.

(The scene changes, and we see Lord Gohda's castle on fire. A ninja kills an innocent woman... fire, blood and death everywhere. Barely standing woman is trying to leave the castle, but meets our heroes.)

Woman: Please! Don’t kill me!

Rikimaru: It’s okay, we’re here to help.

Woman: Oh thank goodness. His Lordship is still inside; so are Lady Kei and Princess Kiku!

Tatsumaru: Ayame, find Lady Kei and the Princess. Rikimaru, come with me, we must rescue Lord Gohda.

Lady Kei in Danger
(Ayame sneaks around the castle of Lord Gohda, killing Motohide’s soldiers. After some time, she finds a room where she sees Gohda Motohide and Lady Kei, who is trying to take away her little Kiki.)

Gohda Motohide: Unhand me!

Lady Kei: No! If you take my daughter, you’ll have to take me too!

(We learn that Lady Kei is Lord Gohda Matsunoshin’s wife.)

Gohda Motohide: I don’t need you. I need the princess!

(Motohide strikes Lady Kei with his sword. Ayame rushes into the room.)

Ayame: Lady Kei! Motohide! You will pay for that!

(We learn that Gohda Motohide is Lord Matsunoshin’s uncle.)

Gohda Motohide: Another ninja brat. I'll teach you how to speak your betters!

[Suddenly, a fat ninja falls from the ceiling.]

Fat Ninja: Wait for Genbu. Genbu sneaks in now! Aw!

Gohda Motohide: Finally. There’s the rest of Lord Toda’s ninjas?

Genbu: Genbu sorrys, Lord Motohide. Genbu will beat up little girl for you.

Gohda Motohide: Good. Destiny holds me.

Ayame: The destiny of cowards is a messy and embarrassing death!

Genbu: Why you so mean to the boss, missy? You want fight? (takes off his mask) You fight Genbu! Master of ninja sneaking!

Ayame: What a shame. You look so much better with the mask on!

(The fight begins. Ayame wins.)

Genbu: Genbu is strongest! Genbu is unbeatable! But today Genbu must sneak away! (drops smoke pellet)

(Thick white smoke fills the room. When it dissipates, we see that Genbu is stuck in the window.)

Genbu: Nice girl… Little help here?

Ayame: What? Get lost! (kick him in the butt)

[Genbu falls out of the window and shouts.]

Genbu: Thanks nice girl for not killing Genbu!

(Ayame comes to Lady Kei.)

Ayame: Lady Kei?

Lady Kei: Ayame?

Ayame: Yes.

Lady Kei: My Ayame. My ninja. (coughs)

Ayame: Oh, my lady, don’t try to speak. I’ll get help.

Lady Kei: Wait. Take these. (give Ayame small bells) Please, take care of Kiku… (dies)

(Tatsumaru enters the room.)

Tatsumaru: Ayame…

Ayame: Motohide murdered Lady Kei and he kidnapped princess Kiku. I’m going after her!

(She jumps out of the window. In the next scene she sits on a tree branch near Lord Toda’s War Camp and overhears a conversation...)

Lord Toda: Ah, sir Motohide. Welcome to my War Camp.

Gohda Motohide: Greetings, Lord Toda. Regrettably, my nephew still lives, however with my excellent swordplay I wounded him… severely…

(We learn the name of Lord Toda – Toda Yoshisada. He is the ruler of the House of Toda.)

Gohda Motohide: and… I kidnapped his daughter. Assign me two divisions of your troops, sir, and I finish the job.

(Suddenly, one of Lord Toda's soldiers kills the Motohide soldier holding Princess Kiku. Lord Toda draws his sword.)

Gohda Motohide: I know I failed… but… pleease… If I get your troops today, I promise that my flag will fly over Gohda’s Castle tomorrow.

Lord Toda: I believe you. But If I need my troops today, then my flag will fly over Gohda’s Castle tomorrow.

Gohda Motohide: What are you talking about? You said we… Aaah!

[Lord Toda strikes Motohide with his sword.]

Lord Toda: The wine of victory is the one you don’t have to share. Ha ha ha!

Gohda Motohide: What?! You lied! Have you no honor?!

Lord Toda: Silence! I am the Lord! The only master I serve is me. Ha ha ha!

Gohda Motohide: Liar… (dies)

Lord Toda: Put the princess in the shed. I DO NOT want her damaged. She will come very handy when I order Lord Gohda to surrender. Ha ha ha!

Ayame: So much for promises – a proper coward's death! If my first priority wasn’t saving princess Kiku, I’ll kill Toda right now for fun!

(Ayame jumps off a tree and goes to the war camp but her way is blocked by a woman in armor.)

Woman In Armor: Oh, it’s just an apprentice girl. (leaves)

Ayame: What was that all about?

To Save a Princess
(Ayame searching the war camp and killing soldiers. After a while she finds a hut with a princess. She is crying.)

Kiku: Mama? Mama?

Ayame: I’m not your… please… stop crying.

Kiku: Mama… Mama…

Ayame: Oh, okay. (hugs her)

Kiku: Hey, who are you?

Ayame: Here, this is for you. (gives her little bells)

Kiku: Oh… My Sister bells!

Ayame: What are Sister bells?

Kiku: What’s your name?

Ayame: Ayame.

Kiku: Here. This bell is for you!

Ayame: What?

Kiku: My mommy made these bells. She made one for me, and one for you. She said that the bells will help us become real sisters. Oh, now I have a big sister! Come on, we have to go to tell mommy! What’s wrong, Ayame? Did you hurt yourself?

Ayame: No, it’s not bad.

Kiku: (crying) You won’t be my sister?

Ayame: No, no, I do…

Kiku: Then… why are you crying?

Ayame: It’s okay. Really. You wanna get back to your castle now?

Kiku: Yeah. Let’s go.

(She puts her behind her back and goes outside.)

Ayame: What’s sounds like... sword fighting?

Kiku: What’s going on? Can we go see?

Ayame: Kiku, brave girl, you’re the best!

(Ayame and Kiku go to watch the fight. Arriving at the place Ayame sees how Tatsumaru and the Woman in Armor are fighting on a high cliff.)

Ayame: Oh, no!

(Rikimaru appears.)

Ayame: Rikimaru, protect princess Kiku!

(She rushes for Tatsumaru.)

(Cutscene: Tatsumaru fights a ninja woman at the top of the cliff. Ayame ran to him. Suddenly, part of the rock breaks off. Tatsumaru along with a female ninja falls into the sea.)

Ayame: Tatsumaru!

(Ayame lying on the edge of the rock, looks sadly at the sea. A ribbon from Tatsumaru's clothes is floating on the water.)

ACT II: THE SHIFTING SANDS (流砂 / Quicksand)

“Three months have passed. Gohda Castle was saved by a well-timed rain shower, just as like the House of Gohda was saved by the Azuma Ninja. While loyal subjects repair the castle, Lord Gohda recovers from his wounds in the Azuma Ninja village. All seems well… but the villager's heart is heavy, for there has been no news of Tatsumaru...”

(Next scene. Ninja village. Ayame plays with the dog while sitting on the doorstep. Next to her we see Lord Gohda Matsunoshin and her teacher, Azuma Shiunsai.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: Ayame. Kidnapped had been taking our villages to a deserted island… Can I count on you to investigate?

Ayame: Of course, my Lord. Helping people is not really my idea of a good time, orders are orders…

(Next scene. Ayame swims to the island.)

Ayame: So this is where they brought the villagers. What a dump…

Kubon Island
(Ayame climbs mountains, swims and kills bandits. Soon she finds a port and the ship transporting captured villagers.)

Bandit: Move! Now!

Ayame: Hm. Those are villages, but where are they taking them?

The Island Fort
(Ayame sneaks into a heavily guarded fort and frees the villages. Some chinese warrior runs to her. We learn his name - Wang Dahai, the head of the Baoliusing.)

Wang Dahai: Halt! Bad person! You dare release slaves of Wang Dahai?

Ayame: O-ho, bad person yourself! You dare make slaves of Ayame’s people?

(The fight begins. Ayame wins.)

Wang Dahai: Agh! I don’t want to die!

Ayame: Will you quit whining? What a sore loser!

(Suddenly Genbu appears blocking the gate with his fat ass.)

Genbu: Hey! Nice little girl! Sneaking ninja Genbu sneaks up on you again! Ha ha ha! NO fair running away.

Ayame: Oh, not again… Out of my way, ignoramus!

Genbu: Oh! My name is not Goramus! This is Genbu the Wise, one of the four lords of the Burning Dawn!

Ayame: You mean Genbu the Drooling Idiot, one of the four Idiots of Idiots Land?

Genbu: No! Don’t you make fun of my new name from Lady Kagami!

Ayame: Kagami?

Genbu: Lady Kagami is a great… uh… lady! She’s gonna make a world just for us, ninjas!Like in her dream for us. That was said, you’re a ninja, you could ask her real nice and I bet she’d let you join.

Ayame: Oh, please. Unlike you losers, I don’t need to live in someone else's dream! I’ve got dreams of my own!

Genbu: Well then, if you won’t join, I won’t let you join! And I’ll beat you up with my sneaky ninja moves!

(he drops a smoke pellet and turns into a stone… at the same spot he stands.)

Genbu: You can’t find me!

(Ayame throws a firebomb at him and sets his ass on fire.)

Genbu: Hot! Hot! Hot!

Ayame: Burning… Dawn? Lady Kagami? A world for ninja? Nah, who cares… he’s just some drunkun-bumpkin.

(Next scene. Lord Gohda sits in his room and painfully recalls the events that took place in his castle. Ayame enters.)

Ayame: They said you want to see me right away, my Lord. What’s up?

Gohda Matsunoshin: The Quarantine Village is under attack… I need you there right away.

Ayame: Quarantine Village? Where’s that?

Gohda Matsunoshin: It’s a village I created to isolate people suffering from contagious diseases.

Ayame: You isolated them?

Gohda Matsunoshin: Yes… but I have no choice. The disease was spreading quickly. What should I have done? I couldn’t just kill them…

Ayame: I’m sorry… I wasn’t thinking. I’ll go check it out.

The Quarantine Village
(Ayame kills the attackers – ninjas from the Burning Dawn. Passing through the village, she stumbles upon some familiar face... Tatsumaru! Not only is he alive, he also kisses a woman in armor… Ayame decided to watch them. After a minute, the woman in the armor leaves. Ayame runs up to Tatsumaru.)

Ayame: Tatsumaru! It is you! I knew you wasn’t dead, I just knew it… but what are you doing here? There’s enemies! And who’s that woman? Oh, it's so good to see you!

Man: Ah… do I know you?

Ayame: Ha… very funny. You big jerk!

Man: No, I never seen you before in my life.

Ayame: What do you mean? It’s Ayame of the Azuma Ninja! Come on, Tatsumaru!

Man: Look, I don’t know any “Tatsumaru”. I’m Seiryu, Lord of the Burning Dawn. Goodbye.

Ayame: Wait… Please. Don’t go!

(Three ninjas jump from somewhere above.)

Ninja of the Burning Dawn: Lord Seiryu! We’ll deal with this little nuisance.

Seiryu: I… very well.

(Seiryu leaves and we learn the name of the ninjas from the Burning Dawn -The Frog, The Slug and The Snake.)

Ayame: Tatsumaru!

The Snake: Not so fast, girl! We’d like a word with you… Sshh.

The Frog: We are the servants of the burning Dawn!

Ayame: Oh, shut up! Out of my way!

(Ayame rushes into battle and wins.)

Ayame: Tatsumaru! Tatsumaru, there are you…

(A pigeon with a message flies to her.)

Ayame: Oh, no! The Ninja Village…

(Ayame returns to the village. Nothing is around but fire and corpses.)

Ayame: No…

(She runs to the teacher's house. When she reaches the house, she sees a woman in armor and Seiryu running out from there. Woman in armor attacked Ayame, but she successfully blocked the blow. Woman in armor runs away. Ayame hears Rikimaru's voice.)

Rikimaru: Master!

(Ayame hesitates a minute, but decides to run after Seiryu.)

Ayame: How could Tatsumaru have forgotten his oath to Master? How he could not remember me?

Cherry Tree Hill
(Ayame climbs up the mountain to the cherry tree. Along the way, she kills the ninja of the Burning Dawn.)

Ayame: Tatsumaru!

Woman in Armor: What a stubborn little girl!

(We learn the name of the woman in armor – Kagami, the head of the Burning Dawn.)

Kagami: When you arrive in hell, let everyone know Lady Kagami sent you. (draw her sword)

Ayame: So, you're Kagami! The one with a drooling idiot follower! How do you add Tatsumaru to your pack of losers?

Kagami: You insolent brat! I'll skin you alive! (Seiryu stops her) What are you doing?

Seiryu: You let her provoke you. Forgot the dream. I will handle her.

Kagami: No! She’s just a child… She cannot provoke me. She… she… You’re right. I lost control. Shamed myself. You deal with her. But be careful. Remember your wound. Come home to me safely, Seiryu… (leaves)

Ayame: Tatsumaru… Did you kill Master Shiunsai? Tell me it’s not true…

Seiryu: That old man was your teacher?

Ayame: He was your teacher too… He was like a father to us! Have you really forgot everything? Can’t you remember any of it? All that time we spent together…

Tatsumaru: It wasn't real.

Ayame:  Is that what you’re saying, Tatsumaru?

Young Ayame (in Seiryu’s head): When I grow up, I'm going to marry you, Tatsu! And we will  live happily ever after! In a big, beautiful church! Tatsu, Tatsu, Tatsu…

Ayame: Tatsu…

Tatsumaru: Ayame… Your name… is Ayame.

Ayame: Ah! You remember!

(She runs to him but he attacks her.)

Ayame: Tatsu… maru…

Seiryu: Ayame… you must forget about me. Tatsumaru is dead! There is only Seiryu now!

Ayame: But… you got your memory back… it can be like it was again…

Seiryu: No… it can’t.

Ayame: Why? WHY?

Seiryu: Because that’s the way it is. If we meet again I WILL kill you!

(He leaves. Rikimaru enters.)

Rikimaru: Ayame? Tatsumaru killed Master Shiunsai. I must avenge his death!

(We learn the name of the dog – Semimaru.)

Ayame: (put her sword to Rikimaru’s neck) I won’t let you kill Tatsumaru!

Rikimaru: Ayame! I must! He killed the Master!

Ayame: No! I will kill Tatsumaru… myself.

Rikimaru: What? But… Oh, I see. You’re not seeking vengeance. You act from a state of pure selflessness. C’mon, Semimaru, take us to Tatsumaru!

Semimaru: Woof-woof!

In Pursuit of Tatsumaru
(Semimaru leads the heroes into the bamboo forest and runs forward. Ayame cautiously makes his way through the forest. The forest is thickened and she hardly sees her enemies. Finally, she, along with Rikimaru, catches up with Semimaru.)

Rikimaru: Come out! Show yourself!

???: Your senses are chapped for your maneuver. I’m Byakko, the White Tiger, one of the four Lords of the Burning Dawn. What’s that? I agree! (to Ayame) Rejoice, woman! You speaking liking to me… (to Semimaru) You have the honor of being eaten by Chiro the Magnificent! (to Rikimaru) As for you… unsavory man… you will have settled to kill by me!

(The battle begins. Ayame kills Byakko. Semimaru kill Chiro.)

Ayame: Are you okay, Semimaru? Good boy!

Semimaru: Woof-woof!

Ayame: You are so tough, Semimaru! Ha-ha!

Rikimaru: Ayame! You guys okay? Come on, let’s get going.

(Semimaru leads the heroes into the cave. He barks, indicating direction.)

Rikimaru: So Tatsumaru in this cave? Good boy! Now, Semimaru, you stay here.

Semimaru: Woof, woof!

Ayame: I’m going in!

(The heroes leave. Semimaru sadly whines as they go.)

The Kansen Caverns
(Ayame has to use all her skill, since there are a lot of pitfalls in the cave. She stops deep into the cave, noticing something unusual.)

Ayame: What kind of ship is that?

Kagami: Seiryu… It’s almost finished… The most powerful warship in history! Finally, my dreams become real!

Seiryu: A world ruled by a ninja.

Kagami: Exactly! We no longer be forced to hide in the night like thieves, we will decide how we live. And how we die!

(One of the ninja soldiers runs up to Kagami.)

Ninja Soldier: Lady Kagami!

Kagami: Stop shouting! I’m talking to Seiryu.

Ninja Soldier: I’m sorry, Lady Kagami.

Kagami: What do you want?

Ninja Soldier: There is an intruder in the cave. Probably an Azuma Ninja.

Kagami: Great… It's all we need… Listen up! We’re moving up a schedule forward! Prepare to launch the ship immediately! Our first target – Gohda Castle!

Ninja Soldier: Yes, my Lady.

Kagami: Seiryu… Do you know why we’re going to destroy Gohda’s Castle?

(Everyone froze in anticipation of her reply.)

Kagami: Our soul purpose in life has been to serve in the endless war between Toda and Gohda! But now… Toda is gone. Gohda is the only thing standing between us and freedom! If we are ever to cast chains off that’ve shackled our spirits for generations, then Gohda must be destroyed! No matter that the cost! Now come on! It's time to board the Fire Demon. We stand at the dawn of a new era.

(Kagami and Seiryu leave. We return to our heroes.)

Rikimaru: I want the castle. You stay with the ship!

Ayame: Agreed!

ACT III: SOLITUDE (幽玄 / Mystery)

“Lady Kagami sails her massive warship “The Fire Demon” toward Gohda Castle. The floating fortress’s great cannon fireballs dims darkly in the moonlight as it takes aim at Gohda Castle.”

(Kagami prepares the ship for sailing and heads for Gohda Castle. She begins to fire the cannons.)

The Fire Demon
(Ayame sneaks around a huge ship and kills the guards, trying to get on the deck.)

Genbu: Stop, nice little girl! Genbu protects Lady Kagami!

Ayame: Oh, Genbu! Look what she’s doing! She’s not worthy of your protection.

Genbu: Everybody says “Genbu, you big, dumb oaf” and everybody laughs, but Lady Kagami says “Genbu, you did good.” She treats me like she treats all the other ninjas. I feel warm inside then she talks to me! She’s worthy of Genbu’s protection!

Ayame: And all the people at Gohda Castle is worthy of my protection!

Genbu: Then I guess we really fight this time!

Ayame: Yeah! We really fight this time!

(The fight begins. Ayame wins.)

Genbu: Sorry, Lady Kagami… Nice girl… what’s your name?

Ayame: Ayame.

Genbu: Ayame… what’s a nice name.

(He drops one of his clubs and dies where he stands.)

Ayame: Goodbye, Genbu the Wise, Lord of the Burning Dawn.

(She runs to the deck and sees Seiryu.)

Seiryu: Ayame… Don’t you remember that I told you?

(She nods.)

Seiryu: Then you know… I must kill you.

Ayame: Oh, you're right! We will fight, but you won’t kill me.

(The fight begins. Ayame wins. Izayoi falls out of the hands of Seiryu. Ayame picks it up and puts it to his throat, but she hesitates and cannot finish him off. Seiryu takes the sword with his hands and pierces himself.)

Ayame: Why, Tatsumaru…? Why?

Tatsumaru: Unforgivable crimes must be punished… the traitor must die… (dies)

(Rikimaru enters.)

Rikimaru: Ayame?

(She throws him Izayoi. They stand still for a couple of minutes then Rikimaru leaves. Ayame jumps from the ship into the sea.)

(Cutscene. Lord Gohda gives orders to burn the Fire Demon.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: Archers! Prepare flaming arrows!

(The archers shoot at the "Fire Demon", setting it on fire. The fire reaches for gunpowder, an explosion takes place, and the characters observe it from the shore. Meanwhile, Ayame is floating in the sea on a piece of board...)

Ayame (thinking): First my master… now Tatsumaru… Why does everyone I love have to die? I rather face the demons of hell than another second of this… emptiness. My work is done. It's time for Ayame to follow Tatsumaru… (she pulls out a bell) Hm. What a pretty sound… I’ll miss it… and I’ll miss Kiku… and a promise I made… uh, poor baby, she’s counting on me. She must be so lonely right now. And scared. Her mother’s gone… just like me… (out loud) I’m gonna keep my promise! No more crying! I got to be tough now!

(The final cutscene. Ayame sits on top of a mountain at a grave made of stones. Rikimaru approaches her.)

Rikimaru: Ayame, you made it!

Ayame: I have to become strong, so no one have ever take away anything I care for.

Rikimaru: I understand.

(Rikimaru is about to leave.)

Ayame: What will you do now?

Rikimaru: I wish only to serve Lord Gohda.

(Rikimaru leaves, but Ayame catches up with him.)

Ayame: Good. I’m going with you to Gohda Castle.

Rikimaru: I’m glad.

Ayame: I have someone there worth dying for… and worth living for.

(A beautiful seagull flies past the heroes.)

THE END

PART 3: TATSUMARU
Now I need you to stop for a moment and take a deep breath. Tatsumaru missions are only available for those who master the game and learn it inside out. So if you are not very familiar with the story of Rikimaru and Ayame, or played a game a long time ago, I strongly recommend you to read it (Part 1 and Part 2). This is all part of the philosophy of the game itself - only a true master will know the truth.

ACT I: THE RED LOTUS (紅蓮)

(Ayame, Rikimaru and Tatsumaru walk to their teacher’s house.)

Ayame: (giggles) What are you two doing here?

Azuma Shiunsai: My students! Rebellion are broken out in the house of Gohda. Our honorable Lord Gohda is in danger from his own uncle, sire Motohide. If the Lord we serve, falls to a dishonorable traitor, we the Azuma Ninja, will stand for nothing. Go to Gohda Castle and protect Lord Gohda with your lives. This is the ancestral sword, Izayoi. The spirit of the Azuma Ninja. Tatsumaru, it is yours. Today, you replace me as Master Ninja. May honor guide your hand.

Tatsumaru: Master…

Rikimaru: But…

Ayame: No!

Azuma Shiunsai: The powerful must know when to pass along their power. As you three graduate to new roles, I also ascend.

Rikimaru: Very well.

Tatsumaru: I obey.

Ayame: Yes, master.

(The scene changes, and we see Lord Gohda's castle on fire. A ninja kills an innocent woman... fire, blood and death everywhere. Barely standing woman is trying to leave the castle, but meets our heroes.)

Woman: Please! Don’t kill me!

Rikimaru: It’s okay, we’re here to help.

Woman: Oh thank goodness. His Lordship is still inside; so are Lady Kei and Princess Kiku!

Tatsumaru: Ayame, find Lady Kei and the Princess. Rikimaru, come with me, we must rescue Lord Gohda.

(Next scene. Rikimaru and Tatsumaru run along the wall, but suddenly Tatsumaru notices someone and stops.)

Tatsumaru: Wait, Rikimaru. Go find his Lordship. I’ll catch up later.

A Shadow
(Tatsumaru sneaks through burning Gohda Castle killing Motohide’s soldiers. Finally, Tatsumaru overtakes the strange samurai in theotral clothing. He cuts the clothes and we see that it is Kagami.)

Tatsumaru: So… you’re a woman…

Kagami: Very perceptive. And I recognize your sword. So, old man Azuma finally retires…

Tatsumaru: Who are you?

Kagami: I’m Lady Kagami, Master of the Nyogetsu Ninjas.

Tatsumaru: You lead Lord Toda’s ninjas? Perfect… Today I put an end to the rivalry between our clans.

Kagami: Our rivalry will end this day… but it doesn’t need to end in blood.

Tatsumaru: What do you mean?

Kagami: Our clans are enemies only because Toda and Gohda wanted that way. We divided… and easily controlled…

Tatsumaru: What are you talking about?

Kagami: Join us! Together our clans will be unstoppable! We can create a new world… a world ruled by the ninja!

Tatsumaru: Never! Ninja lives in the shadows!

Kagami: Do you really want to live your whole life in the dark?

Tatsumaru: Of course! The darkness is my home!

Kagami: Fool! You're a servant, not a warrior. My people follow orders, but they fight for a dream! Freedom! What are you fight for?

Tatsumaru: My Lord.

Kagami: As you wish… It is the wrong choice… but it is yours. What a waste… Seiryu!

Seiryu: Yes, Lady Kagami!

Kagami: I admire you, Master of the Azuma…. but I cannot have you interfering with my dream! (leaves)

Tatsumaru: Wait!

Seiryu: First, you’ll have to get past me! (takes off his mask)

(They fight. Tatsumaru wins and strikes the final blow. Seiryu falls off the roof and dies. Tatsumaru goes to Ayame.)

Tatsumaru: Ayame…

Ayame: Motohide murdered Lady Kei and he kidnapped princess Kiku. I’m going after her!

(She jumps out of the window. Tatsumaru goes ahead and meets Sekiya Naotada.)

Sekiya: Halt! Friend or foe?

Tatsumaru: Friend. I’m Tatsumaru of the Azuma Ninja.

Sekiya: Oh, well met! Tatsumaru… I didn’t recognize you… we’re grateful for your protection.

Tatsumaru: Sire Sekiya… I must inform you that Lady Kei has been murdered by Motohide. We were too slow in reaching the Castle.

Sekiya: Ah… Lady Kei… dead?

Tatsumaru: And… Princess Kiku has been kidnapped. It was entirely my fault.

Sekiya: No… no… the fault is mine! I… should have been alert to Motohide’s treachery. Oh, the poor child…

Tatsumaru: Ayame is chasing the kidnappers.

Sekiya: Good. What about Lord Gohda?

Tatsumaru: Rikimaru will rescue him.

Jubei: Sire Sekiya…

Sekiya: What is it, Jubei?

Jubei: Enemy troops are attacking on our border… They bear the crest of Lord Toda…

Sekiya: Toda?! What’s not possible… News of the rebellion won’t reach his castle for… uh… Motohide! He betrayed us to that jackal Toda!

Tatsumaru: Sire Sekiya… I just killed the Nyogetsu ninja in the castle.

Sekiya: What? Toda’s ninjas… are here?!

Tatsumaru: Yes, sire Sekiya.

Sekiya: So… Now we know who is behind all this…

Tatsumaru: Sire Sekiya… I will bring you the head of Toda Yoshisada!

Sekiya: He will be protected by legions of troops… No, no… the risk is too great.

Tatsumaru: The risk is greater if we don’t act. My life is a small price to pay.

Sekiya: Very well… but... be careful.

(Next scene. Toda’s War Camp.)

Tatsumaru: Now, where could Toda be hiding?

The Head of Lord Toda
(Tatsumaru sneaks through the camp killing the soldiers. Soon he finds Lord Toda's tent…)

Soldier: Lord Toda. What have we do to Lord Motohide’s body?

Lord Toda: Let it rot at where it lies! It have no use anymore. Prepare the troops! In two hours we march at Gohda Castle!

Soldier: Yes, sir. (leaves)

Lord Toda: Finally… No one realizes how hard I work to make these cowardly peasants throw themselves to the enemy’s spears! But the reward for my years of sacrifice comes NOW! (Tatsumaru enters the tent) What do you want?

Tatsumaru: I have come for your head!

Lord Toda: Gohda sent you! GUARDS! GUARDS!

(Two soldiers with bow and spear appear. The fight begins. Tatsumaru defeats Lord Toda.)

Lord Toda: NO! Not this way! I’m Lord Toda! I cannot die at the hands of a lowly ninja!

(Kagami enters the tent.)

Tatsumaru: You’re too late. Now you’re masterless! What are you doing?!

(Kagami decapitates Toda.)

Tatsumaru: That’s your master!

Kagami: I am my own master! (leaves with Toda’s head)

Tatsumaru: Wait!

(Tatsumaru follows her and they come to the top of a huge cliff. Kagami sets Toda's head down and throws her into the abyss. We hear the shouting of soldiers from below and see torches.)

Kagami: (to soldiers) You have just witnessed the birth of the Burning Dawn! Soon you will see the dawn of the new day – the day of the ninja! (to Tatsumaru) You won’t change your mind? I see. Then you must DIE!

(They fight. After that we see the fateful cutscene - Tatsumaru fights Kagami at the top of the cliff. Ayame ran to him. Suddenly, part of the rock breaks off. Tatsumaru and Kagami fall into the sea.)

Ayame: Tatsumaru!

(Ayame lying on the edge of the rock, looks sadly at the sea. A ribbon from Tatsumaru's clothes is floating on the water.)

Tatsumaru: Where… Where am I? I can barely move… Oh…

(Kagami drags Tatsumaru out of the water onto the beach.)

Kagami: You’ve cost me a lot of trouble, ninja. Though…. You are not displeasing me…

(She draws her sword, but… can’t kill him. Instead, she gives him CPR.)

Tatsumaru: (coughs) Who am I?

Kagami: What?

Tatsumaru: Please… what’s my name? I can’t remember… (losing consciousness)

Kagami: You don’t fool me with your clever tricks… Get up!

ACT II: THE SHIFTING SANDS (流砂 / Quicksand)

“After falling into turbulent seas, Tatsumaru was saved by Kagami, the very enemy he sought to kill. After two months of tender care at the hands of Kagami’s servants his body fully recovered… but his memory did not. And so with no recollection of his previous existence he begins a new life as one of the Lords of the Burning Dawn...”

Kagami: Honored allies, allow me to introduce you to the newest Lord of the Burning Dawn… Seiryu, the Blue Dragon!

Genbu: You gonna make HIM a LORD?! He just join!

Kagami: Silence! If you doubt his strength or courage, you may fight him…

Genbu: No, no… If he okay with Lady Kagami, he okay with Genbu.

Kagami: Suzaku? Byakko? What do you say?

Suzaku: I think he’ll prove very useful… against certain enemies…

Byakko: Hopefully he’ll be more useful than previous Blue Dragon. Eh, Chiro? (he roars)

Kagami: I’ve got an important assignment for assembled Lords. I want you to go to one of the frontier towns and capture villagers. I need more laborers to the Fire Demon. (to Seiryu) Put on this mask... and close your heart. Remember... the dream must ALWAYS take priority.

Labour Shortage
(Seiryu sneaks up on the village In the cover of night, knocking out the villagers guarding it. Later, he returns to the Burning Dawn hideout.)

Kagami: Seiryu… you're back. Well done. I've got another job for you. Gohda's Ninja has discovered our secret harbor. You must protect our shipment of slaves. Eliminate anyone who could pose a threat. Hurry.

Guarding the Secret Harbor
(Seiryu will have to kill many of Lord of the Gohda's guards that came on a ship to protect the island. When Seiryu gets to the ship, he is greeted by an old, decrepit old man in Samurai armor. The sword trembles in his hand, but his will remains unshaken.)

Urano Takehito: I'll... I'll fight you. Wait... Wait... Just a minute... My back…

(Seiryu shows respect and fights him as an equal. He wins.)

Urano Takehito: Oh, my aching back! (dies)

(After that, Seiryu descends into the hold, where he stumbles upon Rikimaru.)

Rikimaru: Who are you?

(Seiryu takes out his sword.)

Rikimaru: That blade… It’s Izayoi!

(Seiryu takes off the mask.)

Rikimaru: Tatsumaru! You’re alive!

Ninja: Who’s Tatsumaru? I am Seiryu the Blue Dragon! One of the four Lords of the Burning Dawn!

(Seiryu attacks Rikimaru.)

Rikimaru: Burning Dawn? What are you talking about? You’re Tatsumaru, leader of the Azuma Ninja.

Seiryu: I have no time to talk to a mad man.

Rikimaru: Tatsumaru! It’s me, Rikimaru!

(Seiryu jumps and disappears. He returns to the Burning Dawn hideout.)

Kagami: First the mountain village and now my harbor? May the Gods curse Gohda and those Azuma Ninjas. Well, if he wants to expose my secret harbor, I'll expose his secret quarantine village. Seiryu! We're going to attack Gohda's weak point, his quarantine village near Gohda Castle. We'll teach him a lesson in humiliation.

No Mercy
(Seiryu kills all the quarantine village guards so Kagami may enter it. On the stairs at the entrance to the village, they find a dying man. He can barely speak.)

Diseased Villager: Please... we're dying anyway. Can't you let us... live out the little time we have left?

(He's reaching out to Kagami, begging for mercy.)

Kagami: (laughs) The cries of the weak are so pitiful. I cannot help laughing. Isn't it funny, Seiryu?

Seiryu: Is this how you attain your dream?

Kagami: Yes. I grow my dream on their rotting corpses. Water it with their blood. I’ll… I’ll…

(She squatters and starts coughing.)

Seiryu: Who are you trying to fool, Kagami?

Kagami: I'm not... trying to fool anyone. (sobs) I'm happy. I rejoice in this carnage.

Seiryu: Then why are there tears in your eyes?

Kagami: It's just sweat in my eyes…

(Seiryu approaches and hugs her.)

Kagami: What are you doing? Let me go! Let me go!

(She's rushing out of his arms.)

Kagami: You have your orders. Go now and burn the Azuma village to the ground. There is no going back. We have to do it this way. I owe it to all the ninjas who believe in my dream. I owe it to all those who died following my orders.

(The camera's pulling back. We see that their conversation was eavesdropped by Ayame.)

Ayame: Tatsumaru! It is you! I knew you wasn’t dead, I just knew it… but what are you doing here? There’s enemies! And who’s that woman? Oh, it's so good to see you!

Man: Look, do I know you?

Ayame: Ha… very funny. You big jerk!

Man: No, I never seen you before in my life.

Ayame: What do you mean? It’s Ayame of the Azuma Ninja! Come on, Tatsumaru!

Man: Look, I don’t know any “Tatsumaru”. I’m Seiryu, Lord of the Burning Dawn. Goodbye.

Ayame: Wait… Please. Don’t go!

(Three ninjas jump from somewhere above.)

Ninja of the Burning Dawn: Lord Seiryu! We’ll deal with this little nuisance.

Seiryu: I… very well.

(He leaves.)

Assault on the Azuma Ninja Village
(The village is on fire. Seiryu kills the remaining defenders. Soon he comes to his teacher's house. Inside, Lord Gohda finishes off one of the Burning Dawn soldiers.)

Gohda Matsunoshin: You!

(He's trying to attack, but Seiryu is knocking out his former lord with one blow.)

Shiunsai: Tatsumaru! So, my past has caught up with me. Since I killed your Father. Perhaps it is my karma to die at your hands, Tatsumaru. And… perhaps not. I may be old, but I can still fight.

(They're fighting. After winning, Seiryu kills her former teacher with one blow. But... while the teacher's body was falling on the floor covered in blood... he understood something...)

Tatsumaru: Who is this old man? Does he really know me? I don't remember him, but... I feel like I just lost someone vitally important to me.

(Rikimaru enters.)

Rikimaru: Master!

(When he arrives at Shiunsai's house, he finds his teacher and Lord Gohda dead, and their killer... Seiryu. Rikimaru takes out a sword. Seiryu takes his own.)

Rikimaru: Tatsumaru! You’ve betrayed your clan and your family! You will DIE!

(They're fighting. In the heat of battle, Seiryu looks back at Shiunsai's body, loses his balance and falls to the floor. Rikimaru brings his sword over him.)

Rikimaru: Tatsumaru… prepare to DIE!

Shiunsai: What's wrong with you? Do it!

Rikimaru: I... I can't!

(Rikimaru swings the sword, but the blow does not reach the target. As Rikimaru hesitates, Seiryu takes out his sword and is about to strike. Rikimaru has every chance to repel the blow, but takes away the weapon and turns away, resulting in a scar on his right eye. We hear a scream from outside of the house and a corpse of an old man crushing in, breaking the wall. In the formed opening we see Kagami.)

Kagami: Never start a fight you’re not prepared to finish, boy.

Rikimaru: YOU!

Kagami: Seiryu? We’re leaving.

Seiryu: Yes.

Rikimaru: You’re not going anywhere!

(Rikimaru tries to attack Kagami, but she easily repels his blow.)

Kagami: Your anger betrays you. You cannot conquer me if you cannot conquer your feelings. You didn’t kill Seiryu, so I would spare you. Listen carefully, Rikimaru… A new day is dawning. Conquer your emotions, attain selflessness and then I let you join us.

(She ran away from the house along with Seiryu. Ayame gets in their way, but... Kagami without the slightest effort beats off her swords and, with Seiryu, runs past her. Soon they stop in a forest.)

Kagami: We can rest here for a minute.

Seiryu: Don't worry about me. I'll be alright.

Kagami: Why would I worry about you, big lug? All the same. You'd better let me see that wound.

(She's bandaging his wounds.)

Kagami: Seiryu. Remember what we work for? You only allowed to die that serves me. So don't get yourself killed without my permission.

Seiryu: (laugh)

Kagami: And what is so funny?

Seiryu: I'll get to work on that dying in a way that serves you.

Kagami: Make sure you do that. I forbid you to die under any other…

(Ayame runs in.)

Ayame: Tatsumaru!

Kagami: What a stubborn little girl. When you arrive in hell, let everyone know Lady Kagami sent you. (draw her sword)

Ayame: So,you're Kagami! The one with drooling idiot followers! How do you add Tatsumaru to your pack of losers?

Kagami: You insolent brat! I'll skin you alive! (Seiryu stops her) What are you doing?

Seiryu: You let her provoke you. Forgot the dream. I will handle her.

Kagami: No! She’s just a child… She cannot provoke me. She… she… You’re right. I lost control. Shamed myself. You deal with her. But be careful. Remember your wound. Come home to me safely, Seiryu… (leaves)

Ayame: Tatsumaru… Did you kill Master Shiunsai? Tell me it’s not true…

Seiryu: That old man was your teacher?

Ayame: He was your teacher too… He was like a father to us! Have you really forgot everything? Can’t you remember any of it? All that time we spent together… it wasn’t real? Is that what you’re saying, Tatsu?

Young Ayame (in Tatsumaru’s head): When I grow up, I’ll marry you, Tatsu! And we live happily ever after! In a big, beautiful church! Tatsu, Tatsu, Tatsu…

Ayame: Tatsu…

Tatsumaru: Ayame… Your name… is Ayame.

Ayame: Ah! You remember!

(She runs to him but he attacks her.)

Ayame: Tatsu… maru…

Seiryu: Ayame… you must forget about me. Tatsumaru is dead! There is only Seiryu now!

Ayame: But… you got your memory back… it can be like it was again…

Seiryu: No… it can’t.

Ayame: Why? WHY?

Seiryu: Because that’s the way it is. If we meet again I WILL kill you!

(He leaves. Rikimaru enters.)

Kagami: Seiryu, have you taken care of that annoying girl?

Seiryu: Yes. I...

Kagami: What?

Seiryu: Nothing.

(They walk to the Fire Demon.)

Kagami: Seiryu… It’s almost finished… The most powerful warship in history! Finally, my dreams become real!

Seiryu: A world ruled by a ninja.

Kagami: Exactly! We no longer be forced to hide in the night like thieves, we will decide how we live. And how we die!

(One of the ninja soldiers runs up to Kagami.)

Ninja Soldier: Lady Kagami!

Kagami: Stop shouting! I’m talking to Seiryu.

Ninja Soldier: I’m sorry, Lady Kagami.

Kagami: What do you want?

Ninja Soldier: There is an intruder in the cave. Probably an Azuma Ninja.

Kagami: Great… It's all we need… Listen up! We’re moving up a schedule forward! Prepare to launch the ship immediately! Our first target – Gohda Castle!

Ninja Soldier: Yes, my Lady.

Kagami: Seiryu… Do you know why we are going to destroy Gohda Castle?

(Everyone froze in anticipation of her reply.)

Kagami: Our soul purpose in life has been to serve in the endless war between Toda and Gohda! But now… Toda is gone. Gohda is the only thing standing between us and freedom! If we are ever to cast chains off that’ve shackled our spirits for generations, then Gohda must be destroyed! No matter that the cost! Now come on! It's time to board the Fire Demon. We stand at the dawn of a new era.

(The dock workers are preparing the ship for departure. Kagami orders to shoot from the cannon and pierce the wall of the shelter so that the ship can swim. All bridges are burned. There is no turning back.)

ACT III: SOLITUDE (幽玄 / Mystery)

“With the completion of the floating fortress, Fire Demon, the Burning Dawn finally has the weapon it needs to conquer all of Japan. The warship gives them the power they need to bring their dream to life – the creation of a new nation where ninja control their own destiny. The first target – Gohda Castle.”

(Cutscene: The Fire Demon appears from behind the rocks along with a dizel of small ships, colossally inferior to it in size. The ship comes closer and starts firing its massive cannons. Meanwhile, Kagami and Seiryu are standing on the observation tower.)

Kagami: Gohda fights with more courage than I expected… but he cannot defeat the Fire Demon. Gohda Castle will be ours.

Seiryu: Rikimaru and Ayame will be here soon. I will hold them off as long as I can.

Kagami: What was that? Rikimaru? Ayame? How do you know? So... your memory has returned. And why did you come back?

Seiryu: A ninja seeks a place to die and through your methods are wrong… this is mine.

Kagami: Why here?

Seiryu: Because your dream is worth dying for.

(Kagami looks shocked. She comes running up and hugs Seiryu behind his back.)

Kagami: ...I had no tears before I met you. I never knew joy either. You are my heart. (almost whispering) I love you. If only we’ve met another time… I’ve… This could be different...

(Seiryu turns around and slides his palm over her face.)

Seiryu: Farewell.

The Final Dawn
(Tatsumaru Seiryu Gohda’s soldiers boarding the Fire Demon lithe there’s no tomorrow. In the end he’s destined to face Gohda’s greatest warrior.)

Tachibana Jubei: (after killing 3 soldiers of the Dawn) Tatsumaru, you're one of the Lords of the Burning Dawn.

Seiryu: Jubei, hello. A mighty samurai dies fighting a mere ninja. It's almost funny.

Tachibana Jubei: Yes. It would be a ninja. A hired help who stabs from behind. Let's see you fight like a man.

(The battle of a tiger versus a dragon begins. Both opponents are incredibly strong, but Seiryu manages to win. Ayame appears.)

Seiryu: Ayame… Don’t you remember that I told you?

(She nods.)

Seiryu: Then you know… I must kill you.

Ayame: Oh, you're right! We will fight, but you won’t kill me.

(The fight begins. Ayame wins. Izayoi falls out of the hands of Seiryu. Ayame picks it up and puts it to his throat, but she hesitates and cannot finish him off. Seiryu takes the sword with his hands and pierces himself.)

Ayame: Why, Tatsumaru…? Why?

Tatsumaru: Unforgivable crimes must be punished… the traitor must die… (dies)

(Rikimaru enters.)

Rikimaru: Ayame?

(Cutscene: Barely alive Kagami crawling up to the body of Seiryu.)

Kagami: Ta… Tatsumaru… Hm… I like the way your name sounds. I wish I had call you Tatsumaru. You kept your promise… you died in a manner that serves me…

(Gohda’s archers shoot fire arrows at the Fire Demon.)

Kagami: Served me in the highest way, but I've failed us. Death has opened my heart... and I see... Oh my love, next time, I will heed my heart. Then, we can truly build a world where ninja will live in the light.

(The Fire Demon explodes and sinks. Next to it, mournfully squawking, a seagull flies by.)

SECRET ENDING
(On the next ship, burning like a forest fire, we see Suzaku, who, as it turned out, is still alive. He takes the blindfold off and we realize that it's Onikage from the first game.)

Onikage: Ha ha. What fun we've had. And I've still got those pesky Azuma Ninjas to torment. Is this enough carnage to satisfy me? NO! No more destruction! More blood! Soon. Soon, the master will return to me. Lord Mei-Oh! I await your return Oh, exalted one!

THE END
