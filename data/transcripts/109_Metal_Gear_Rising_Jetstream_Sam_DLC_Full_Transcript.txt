[Monsoon and Senator Armstrong enter the beautiful Japanese garden we saw in FILE R-04: Hostile Takeover of the original game.]

Monsoon: Hmm, cherry blossoms… 

Senator Armstrong: Yeah. 

Monsoon: I take it you're not a fan? 

Senator Armstrong: They make me sick. I knew Johnson's team was working on some fancypants new reception area…

[He squats in front of the pond.]

Senator Armstrong: But Jesus…  When I get my hands on that candy-ass… He'll be lucky if he can even carry his box of shit out of the building. 

Monsoon: Heh. Is it really so horrible? They're only trees. 

Senator Armstrong: They go from full blossom to bare in a week. One fucking week! Everywhere in D.C., you hear, “Oh, it's so fleeting and beautiful…” Pathetic. What do you think? 

Monsoon: Nature is just nature -- not beautiful, not ugly. The wind blows, the flowers float away. It's simply how things are. In any case, Minuano should be close. 

Senator Armstrong: Minuano… The cool Brazilian wind… 

Monsoon: (smiles) A.k.a. Jetstream Sam… 

[Meanwhile, Sem arrives in town in his chopper. He removes his wind goggles and smiles radiantly, stroking his stubble. He goes to the manhole into the sewer, but is spotted by two corrupt policemen.]

Policeman 1: Hey!

Sam: Hmm? 

[Policemen laughs nastingly and take out the electric batons]

Policeman 1: Hey. What the hell you think you're doing, buddy? 

[Sam approaches them.]

Policeman 1: (taps Sam's armor with his baton) Well, whatta we have here? Oh… 

Sam: (puts his hand on the scabbard of his electric sword) This?

[Using the sword-shot mechanism, Sam sends Policeman 1 flying. The second policeman is shocked by what's happening.]

Sam: Whoops… 

[Sam jumps away from the second policeman, grabs his sword, and chops the first policeman in half, then finishes off the second one. After that he jumps into the sewers.]

Sam: Ay, the smell… 

Policeman 3: That samurai bastard came this way. 

[Sam enters the underground laboratory and starts chopping up the policeman guarding the place.]

Policeman 4: Target located. 

[He finds a VR training computer…]

Sam: Well, what do we have here? Maybe I should give it a try… 

Soldier: I'll still kick your ass! 

[He destroys some soldiers and two MGs in seconds, then leaves the VR and continues through the sewers.]

Robotic Voice: Greetings, samurai. 

[Sam prepares to fight. He looks around but sees no one. Suddenly an invisible metal dog attacks him. They have a short but epic fight.]

Sam: And you are…? 

Robot Dog: LQ-84i. A prototype UG with a conversational interface. 

Sam: (smirks) A talking robot dog, basically? 

LQ-84i: State your business here. 

Sam: Me? Oh, just… sharpening my skills. Wandering the earth, dispensing justice. But only to those who deserve it… Such as… Outlaws. Desperados. 

LQ-84i: You refer to World Marshal. 

Sam: The ones holding your leash, right? 

LQ-84i: The ones who issue my orders. 

Sam: And… your orders are to kill me? 

LQ-84i: (pulls out a chainsaw) Yes. 

Sam: (smirks) Call me biased, but those seem like pretty dumb orders, pup. (sheaths his sword) Why don't you try thinking for yourself? 

[And he just walks away.]

LQ-84i: For… myself? 

[LQ-84i blocks Sam’s path.]

LQ-84i: Should I disobey a direct order, my memory would be wiped! 

Sam: Well, that's a pity. 

LQ-84i: I am sorry -- you must die. 

Sam: Then… (unsheaths his sword) I am sorry… as well… 

[They start fighting.]

LQ-84i: Superficial damage. 

[Sam chops up the cheap toy with a few powerful strikes.]

LQ-84i: How… How did you…

Sam: You fight because you're forced to. I fight… because I choose to. 

LQ-84i: My design… is flawed… 

Sam: Now, now… I AM quite good, you know. 

LQ-84i: But… I… 

[Sam continues through the sewers.]

Sam: Why do these sewers seem so familiar…? 

Solder: Found 'im!

[Sam finds the entrance to the laboratory.]

Sam: At last, our hero reaches the castle…

[He swiftly and stealthy gets through the corridors drawing no attention to himself.]

Sam: Just what I was looking for…

[He finds a freight elevator and activates it. A few soldiers attack him.]

Soldier: Target located.

Sam: Dammit!

Soldier: HQ! The intruder is riding up on West number two.

HQ: Roger that. Shutting it down and sending reinforcements. Assist them in engaging the intruder.

Soldier: Copy.

[Sam laughs as he welcomes new enemies. Two MGs appear. After chopping them into pieces, Sam jumps over the container and opens the gate and walks into a huge hangar.]

Monsoon: Welcome to Denver. I am Monsoon. We've been expecting you, Sam.

[He walks on the ceiling in magnetic boots.]

Sam: Oh?

Monsoon: They say you took on a drug cartel back in Brazil, all by yourself.

Sam: Almost took it down, too.

Monsoon: If you had, another outfit would have taken its place. One way or another, it always goes back to business as usual. You realized that, didn't you, Sam? That's why you left.

Sam: I was out for revenge. And I got it.

Monsoon: Well, then… Let's see what you got now.

[He jumps down dropping some smoke pellets. An MG RAY walks into the hangar… He roars furiously. Sam fights the modified version of the MG Raiden encountered and wins.]

Senator Armsrong: (via CODEC) Well done, Sam. But you haven't quite passed the test yet. Come on up to the top floor. It'd be a shame if we didn't meet after you went to all this trouble.

[Sam fights his way to a wooden gate corridor.]

Monsoon: (via CODEC) You're everything they said you were, Sam…. Yet still so naive…

Sam: Oh? And how is that?

Monsoon: (via CODEC) Outfits like ours… They're living things. You can't destroy them with violence alone. You may kill a part of it -- a limb or two -- but the main body will survive. 

Sam: Then I'll just have to kill all of it… All of you…

Monsoon: (via CODEC) (laughs) We're not some band of favela thugs… I told you, our outfit is a living thing -- with offspring. With influence. Our memes. You've destroyed plenty of street gangs, all over the world. Yet… are we any closer to world peace? 

Sam: I'm not here for the world. I'm here for myself.

Monsoon: (via CODEC) Well now, that's more like it. Let's just see how far that attitude gets you here, shall we?

[Sam makes his way through classic Japanese buildings, and has a fight on top of the castle in the center, then jumps to the garden.]

Monsoon: (via CODEC) Nothing like a swordfight under the cherry blossoms…

[Destroying a couple of MGs Sam enters another laboratory.]

Soldier: Target located.

[He encounters another LQ-84i but without speaking capabilities.]

Sam: Another one…? This place is huge… Where do they all come from, eh?

[He quickly deals with it and a bunch of soldiers, and walks into the elevator.]

Senator Armsrong: (via CODEC) I'm impressed, Sam.

Sam: Who is this?

Senator Armsrong: (via CODEC) But not surprised… You're one of the most qualified applicants we've ever had.

Sam: Applicants? I'm not here for a job.

Senator Armsrong: (via CODEC) (laughs) Oh, but you're doing so well at our test, Sam.

Sam: You're… Armstrong… I already have a job -- destroying men like you. Bastards who keep the status quo, send others to die. All from your cushy corner office where--

Senator Armsrong: (via CODEC) Well put, Sam. You and I have more in common than you think… Come on up to the roof for your final interview.

Sam: What are you talking about?

Senator Armsrong: (via CODEC) (laughs) Hurry -- don't wanna keep the new boss waiting.

[Confused about Arsmtrog's last words, Sam runs to the roof. He is confronted by gorilla robots, who still manage to damage the nimble Sam, but he chops their arms off and halves them. Next thing you know, a corridor full of soldiers awaits him.]

Soldier: Contact!

Sam: Ah… Wrong one.

Soldier: What else you got?!

Soldier: Found 'im!

Soldier: Shit, that's not good…

Soldier: My legs… You fuck!

[Cutting through the hordes of enemies Sam finds his way to the helipad where Raiden will face Sundowner some time later. But now… there’s Armstrong.]

Senator Armstrong: Sam. Thanks for comin' in.

Sam: What's your game, Armstrong? Gonna talk me to death?

[Armstrong laughs and smokes a cigar.]

Senator Armstrong: Like I said, son: Time for your final interview!

[He gets into a sumo fight stance and stomps his foot. Nearby military vehicles - helicopters, APCs - turn into waves of energy that pour into Armstrong's body. Sam laughs and claps his hands. The senator is turning into his battle form. Nanomachines, son!]

Senator Armstrong: (adjusting his glasses) Come on!

Sam: (unsheaths his sword) ОК. Let's dance.

[The epic fight begins!]

Senator Armstrong: You're going down! 

[He easily blocks Sam strikes with his bare hands.]

Senator Armstrong: That's the best you got?

[But Sam is no pushover. He dodges all Armstrong’s attacks and finally he cuts Armstrong deep with his sword as fast as a bullet. The Senator falls but quickly recovers.]

Sam: What the hell are you…?

Senator Armstrong: We could use a man like you, Sam. Organized violence… Waging war as business… We're going to put an end to all that bullshit.

Sam: Maybe… Maybe I misjudged you.

Senator Armstrong: Then, how about it? Will you lend us a hand?

Sam: A hand, eh…? How about I take yours?!

[They have a new battle, but as it turns out the first time the Senator did not fight to his full potential. He easily fends off Sam's attacks with his bare hands. Sam notices that Armstrong needs some time to cover her body with nanomachines, so she strikes quickly using his scabbard. The Senator's arm flies off to the side and Sam rejoices in his victory, however… The sharp arm stump is also covered by the nanomachines and Armstrong pierces Sam with it.]

Senator Armstrong: Not bad, son… But… Like Monsoon said…

[He reattaches the chopped off arm to his body.]

Senator Armstrong: Losing a limb or two, won't stop us.

Sam: The hell…?

Senator Armstrong: The job's yours… Welcome aboard.

[He holds out his recently severed hand to Sam. The Senator laughs evilly.]

[CREDITS]

[In the last scene we return to the first mission of the original game.]

Soldier: Clear the road! This is official state business!

[Sam quickly unsheaths his sword.]

Soldier: I said, clear the road! We're authorized to use force if you do n--

[Sam runs quickly to the APC. The video stops.]
