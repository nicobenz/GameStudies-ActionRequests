A RELIC ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION

Ultramarines fleet -- Strike Cruiser Fury of Descent
TARGET: Forge World Gracia
STATUS: Planetary invasion in Progress, +9 Terrain Days

OBJECTIVE: Secure the Titans

[A spaceshift descends to the planet. Inside it there are three Ultramarines.]

Masked Leandros: Captain Titus, the Orks have massacred the Forge World's forces. And they have taken the planetary defense weapons.

Sergeant Sidonus: Clever of the damned Orks. Keeps us off their backs, while they lost the Titan war machines.

Pilot: Brace for evasive maneuvers.

Sergeant Sidonus: Pilot: Report.

Pilot: Starboard engine is dead, Sergeant. We are losing altitude --

Captain Titus: Get the ship to safety. We find another way down.

Pilot: Aye, Captain. Thunderhawk Lance of Jove returning to launch bay…

[The captain opens the cargo hatch.]

Sergeant Sidonus: This is your plan?

Captain Titus: We need to get to the surface to take out the gun battery. Or do you want to go home already, Sergeant?

Sergeant Sidonus: Hah. Not before having a word or two with the Orks.

Masked Leandros: Is that wise, Captain? The Codex Astartes does not support this action--

Captain Titus: Try to keep up.

[He jumps out of the ship. The battle is raging around. Ships of the Orks are under massive fire. The captain evades shots and lands on one of the Ork ships. He starts to kill Orks violently with his bolter and chain sword.]

Chapter 1: Planetfall
Ork Captain: Get off my ship, Space Marine! You're gonna die. I'm gonna put your head on a spike, Space Marine.

[Captain Titus rotates the main cannon and blows up the ship. With the falling ship, he lands on the planet. Crawling out a pile of Orks corpses, he stands up in a proud pose.]

WARHAMMER 40,000
Space Marine

Sergeant Sidonus: (via comm) Captain Titus, come in. Damned Orks shot me off course. I've had no word from Leandros. But I'm picking up vox chatter from Imperial Guard forces on the ground.

Captain Titus: I scarcely thought any would be left alive, much less still fighting.

Sergeant Sidonus: (via comm) Heading towards the front lines now.

Captain Titus: I will meet you there.

Chapter 2: Against All Odds
[Captain Titus goes through the ruins of the old city filled with Orks. Soon he stumbles upon his subordinate, surrounded by a small group of Orks.]

Leandros: Captain!

Captain Titus: Destroy them.

[Together they quickly destroy the detachment of Orks. Leandros does this with extreme cruelty, seemingly unnecessary.]

Captain Titus: Leandros! Are you wounded?

Leandros: The Codex Astartes warns against using jump packs to leap blindly into enemy fire -- and for good reason.

Captain Titus: Your days as a novice are behind you. Why do you still interpret the Codex so narrowly?

Leandros: I look to its rules for guidance.

Captain Titus: We all do. But there are also benefits to thinking for yourself.

Leandros: Enemy sighted! We make for the defense cannon, Captain?

Captain Titus: Sidonus picked up local Imperial Guard communications. They survived under the shadow of that gun. I want to know how.

Soldier: My lord, you have saved us.

Captain Titus: Rise, Guardsman. You saved yourselves -- we thought you dead.

Soldier: We would be, my lord, if not for the Lieutenant.

Captain Titus: Where will we find this Lieutenant?

Soldier: At the front lines. Follow the trench network to the Lieutenant's command bunker.

Captain Titus: Carry on, Guardsman. We rendezvous with Sidonus, then we find this Lieutenant. We need updated intel on the gun battery.

Soldier: Through here, my lords. Head out the upper level, and continue through the plaza. The bunkeris beyond that.

Captain Titus: Remarkable. A few hundred against a million Orks. And they fight on.

Leandros: "Only in death does duty end."

Sergeant Sidonus: (via comm) Captain-- I’m in position at a broken monument near the Guardilines.

Leandros: There he is.

Captain Titus: Sergeant, I see you found something to keep you busy.

Sergeant Sidonus: Worry not, Captain... ...I've saved some Orks for you. The Orks have got that gun well defended, no mistake. But typical Ork behavior would be to dismantle or destroy the gun...

Captain Titus: And certainly not use it to keep our forces at bay. There's a strategy behind it. Their leader is no fool.

Sergeant Sidonus: This day's getting interesting.

Captain Titus: I may have encountered the Ork during our jump to the surface.

Sergeant Sidonus: That was the ork ship I saw crash near here, I take it. Did he survive?

Captain Titus: If the horde hasn't turned on itself, it's still under his control.

[The squad makes their way through some Orks skulls.]

Soldier: Space Marines, thank you! We thought we were done for!

Sergeant Sidonus: Where is your commander, Guardsman?

Soldier: Inside - but the door is sealed.

Sergeant Sidonus: I believe they will let us through. Imperial Guard! We are Ultramarines. Open this door!

Lieutenant: Thank the Emperor. Second Lieutenant Mira, 203rd Cadian regiment.

Leandros: Captain Titus of the Ultramarines.

Sergeant Sidonus: You are in command?

Second Lieutenant Mira: I am all that's left, my lord, unless my commanders rise from the grave. So far, they seem content to stay put.

Soldier: Lieutenant! The scouts have returned to forward base.

Second Lieutenant Mira: How many?

Soldier: Two.

Second Lieutenant Mira: Damn. I sent out ten. That damned gun. We don't have the numbers to make an assault. And as you might have seen it's shooting down all our support vessels.

Captain Titus: That is why we are here. Leave the gun to us.

Second Lieutenant Mira: Come with me, then. I should warn you, my lords. We've got a slight Ork problem down here.

Captain Titus: What do you know of the Titans on this planet?

Second Lieutenant Mira: Only that some of our troops were sent to guard the Titan "Invictus" at Manufactorum Ajakis. But that was two weeks ago, and we've lost contact with them.

Captain Titus: We need to reach that Titan.

Second Lieutenant Mira: Your fastest route is across the rail bridge behind the gun complex. It leads directly to the western gates of the Manufactorum.

Soldier: Digga! DIGGA!

Second Lieutenant Mira: Form a damn firing line! The Urks hold the trenches beyond the ruins, and the battlements beyond that.

Captain Titus: And the gun battery?

Second Lieutenant Mira: The Orks took it almost as soon as we got here, nearly two weeks ago. Our unit was the only one to make landfall before they sained control -- now none of our ships can get past the gun.

Second Lieutenant Mira: That's where the Orks breached the gun battery. We haven't been able to make it inside the wall. There just aren't enough of us...

Captain Titus: You have survived this long on your own, Lieutenant - you have done well. But you are no longer alone. We will retake the gun. You will get your reinforcements.

Second Lieutenant Mira: I'll hold you to that, Captain.

[She leaves with her soldiers. Captain Titus and his squad move towards the battery.]

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) We're heading back to the command post, Captain. Good luck.

Captain Titus: Once we get through these battlements we will use the breach caused by the Rok to enter the gun fortress.

Sergeant Sidonus: Look at these cables...

Leandros: They must be powering Ork contraptions across the battlefield. Captain - Assault support pods were dropped in this area.

[Captain Titus enters and exits the capsule with a jetpack on his shoulders.]

Leandros: Take to the high ground, Captain. We will deal with Orks down here. Here is the Rok, at last.

Sergeant Sidonus: No room for that jump pack, Captain. That rok delivered the Orks right into the gun fortress.

Chapter 3: Belly of the Beast
Sergeant Sidonus: This fortress is swarming with Orks. Clearing this place will take days.

Captain Titus: Those Guardsmen cannot survive that long. We find a way to destroy the gun.

[He retrieves the weapon from the supply pod.]

Supply Pod: Space Marine recognized. Access to experimental Vengeance Launcher granted.

Sergeant Sidonus: A Vengeance Launcher? That sounds promising.

[Ultramarines walk in the next room, cleansing the other one of the Ork scum of course.]

Sergeant Sidonus: An armory. Sure to be something useful.

Leandros: Look here, Captain: Melta charges.

Sergeant Sidonus: Put those in the right place, and this whole fortress will come down.

Leandros: We could put the charge on one of the gun's shells.

Sergeant Sidonus: Leandros, you do the Chapter proud.

Leandros: Shell storage is below. Here, Captain. We need to get the shell into the loader.

Captain Titus: There. I will place the charge on that shell. Now to move the shell into place.

Leandros: All loaded, Captain.

Sergeant Sidonus: With luck the Orks will feed it right into the gun's chamber.

Captain Titus: We cannot rely on luck for this, Sidonus. We follow the shell up and make sure it reaches its destination.

Sergeant Sidonus: Aye. Now back to the lift. We seem to have annoyed these Orks. There. A secondary lift. There's our shell. Argh. The Orks have pulled it out of sequence.

Captain Titus: Then we put it back. Leandros! Get the shell into that loader. I will cover you.

[While Liaedros load a shell, Titus and Sidonus fight off the Orks.]

Sergeant Sidonus: Incoming fire! Incoming! Enemy sighted! Hold the line!

Leandros: In place, Captain.

Sergeant Sidonus: And up it goes. We would be better off seeing this fortress detonate from the outside.

Captain Titus: Agreed. Find an exit.

[The battery explodes. Ultramarines epically run out without looking back at the explosion.]

Chapter 4: Titans of Graia
Sergeant Sidonus: The Guardsmen will get their supplies now.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) Captain Titus? You are a man of your word, my lord. Thank you.

Captain Titus: What is your situation Lieutenant?

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) We're gathering our wounded and are heading to the Andris Habitation Block to establish an outpost. With the cannon down, our support craft will land there.

Captain Titus: Very well. My battle brothers and I must secure any operational warlord-class Titans before the Onks can loot them.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) Good luck.

[Ultramarines return to their main task and move on.]

Sergeant Sidonus: Now that bridge is a testament to the might of the Imperium.

Leandros: The Adeptus Mechanicus are masterful architects.

Captain Titus: Their work outlived all of them.

[An Ork train pulls up to the far station.]

Leandros: What in Guilliman's name is that?

Captain Titus: Nothing good.

Leandros: Did the Lieutenant not say these tracks went to the complex housing the Titans?

Sergeant Sidonus: That thing is a battering ram.

[They climb aboard the ram. It continues to move.]

Captain Titus: Now to stop this ram. Time to impact?

Sergeant Sidonus: No more than six minutes.

Captain Titus: Time enough.

[They walk through the cars killing the Orks.]

Captain Titus: Sidonus! Time to impact?

Sergeant Sidonus: Less than four minutes.

Captain Titus: We need to deal with that dropship. Bolter fire cannot penetrate its armor.

Sergeant Sidonus: These trains have point defense turrets. There will be a heavy weapon ahead.

Captain Titus: Forward then.

Leandros: Turret sighted.

Captain Titus: Cover me while I get to that weapon!

[When the captain stands behind the turret, an Ork warship appears and fires at a train rushing at great speed. Titus manages to epically destroy the ship and shoot back from the Orks and, ultimately, destroy the ram.]

Chapter 5: The Inquisitor
Leandros: The Manufactorum still holds!

Sergeant Sidonus: Some Imperial Guard units made it here after all.

Captain Titus: They cannot hold for long. We must hurry.

[They notice a servo skull scanning corpses.]

Leandros: What is that servo skull doing?

Sergeant Sidonus: Trying to deliver a message. Must be damaged. The seal of the Inquisition. Interesting.

[The skull scans Captain Titus.]

Leandros: What is the Inquisition doing here?

Captain Titus: We are about to find out.

[The skull plays pre-recorded message.]

Inquisitor: This is Inguisitor Drogan. I need urgent assistance at Manufacturum Ajakis. They're after the experimental device-- The device is safe for the time being - I've drawn them off, but now I'm trapped… if I die you must keep the device out of enemy hands, or he'll be unstoppable... I needed more time. The weapon was nearly ready…

Sergeant Sidonus: An experimental weapon...?

Captain Titus: We need to find the Inquisitor before the Orks do. Keep moving. Remain alert.

Leandros: Captain - Look. The Orks must be operating that crane.

Sergeant Sidonus: They will not stop until they break through that gate.

Captain Titus: We must disable that crane.

Leandros: The control room!

Captain Titus: Forward! Clear out the Orks.

Leandros: The Orks have managed to power that cannon.

Sergeant Sidonus: Even a single shot will blast right through the gates.

Captain Titus: We cannot allow that.

[After breaking through the hordes of Orks, the squad reaches the control room. They hear the voice of a soldier on the radio.[

Soldier: Number Two Control Deck, do you read?

Captain Titus: This is Captain Titus of the Ultramarines. Identify yourself.

Soldier: This is Corporal Antioch, sir... That is, my lord...

Captain Titus: I need access to the Manufactorum, Corporal.

Corporal Antioch: There is a service lift in the hangar directly below where you dropped the cargo, my lord. We can meet you there.

Captain Titus: Stand ready, we will be there shortly. Titus out.

Sergeant Sidonus: A handful of Guardsmen holding that huge gate. They cannot last long.

Leandros: They did manage to bring the access bridge down, robbing the Orks of their advantage of numbers.

Corporal Antioch: (via comm) My lords - you must hurry. The Greenskins are on the move again. If they find the access point we are using, we will not last long.

Captain Titus: Corporal Antioch. We are in position.

Corporal Antioch: (via comm) Excellent, Captain. I'm sending the lift up now.

Captain Titus: Antioch, hold the lift! We have Orks inbound!

[The squad kills the Orks.]

Captain Titus: Corporal Antioch?

Corporal Antioch: Yes, my lord.

Captain Titus: We have word that an Inquisitor is in the Manufactorum.

Corporal Antioch: Yes - Lord Drogan. We have not seen him in several days. Has the Liberation Fleet arrived, my lord?

Captain Titus: The Fleet is still en route, Corporal. The Ultramarines are here as a vanguard, to cripple the enemy and secure the most valuable assets.

Corporal Antioch: I see.

Captain Titus: But the facility - and its Titans - remain secure?

Corporal Antioch: All I can say for certain is that no Ork has breached this gate, my lord.

Captain Titus: Contact Lieutenant Mira. Her unit is establishing a bastion in Hab Center Andris, and your support craft now have a viable approach from orbit.

Corporal Antioch: What of the Colonel and his staff?

Captain Titus: They did not survive.

Corporal Antioch: Here we are, my lord.

Captain Titus: My thanks, Corporal.

Chapter 6: Lair of Giants
The squad enters Manufactorum Ajakis.]

Leandros: At last- a place the Orks have not stained.

Sergeant Sidonus: For now. I doubt even dropping that cannon on them will convince Orks to back away.

Captain Titus: Indeed. We must find this Inquisitor and the Titan Invictus.

[They take the elevator to the hangar of the Imperium's most formidable weapon.]

Leandros: Titan Invictus seems undamaged, at least.

Sergeant Sidonus: Titan Invictus seems unused, you mean. Is this invasion not enough to bring out the war titans?

Leandros: It takes hundreds to get a War Titan operational, Sergeant. Without them, it sits idle. Captain, this is an augur station. I can scan for the Inquisitor's life signs.

Computer: Access authorized.

Leandros: There -- a lone human.

Computer: Identity confirmed: Drogan. Ordo Xenos.

Sergeant Sidonus: He's in this wing of the manufactorum.

Leandros: I read alien signals throughout the facility. And a large number converging on the Inquisitor's location.

Captain Titus: Leandros, can you use this panel to contact our other forces?

Leandros: Not directly, but I can boost vox range.

Computer: Access authorized. Ultramarines chapter.

Leandros: Here, Captain.

Captain Titus: Ultramarines, this is Captain Titus. Are you receiving?

Ultramarine: Captain. This is Sergeant Midas. Squad Solinus is on the ground and making for our objective.

Captain Titus: New orders, Midas. We are at Manufactorum Ajakis -- and have located the Titan "Invictus". I need Solinus to come secure the Invictus, while I divert to a priority alarm.

Sergeant Midas: On our way, Captain. Midas, out.

Leandros: The pipes -- the Orks are in the pipes.

[The squad finds the inquisitor in some control room. He tries to get access to something, but nothing comes of it. In rage, he punches the panel.]

Inquisitor Drogan: 

Captain Titus: Inquisitor Drogan?

Inquisitor Drogan: ...I am Drogan. And you are...?

Captain Titus: Captain Titus of the Ultramarines. We received your distress call, but you seem to have weathered the enemy's attack.

Inquisitor Drogan: I am soldier and scientist both, Captain.

Captain Titus: What is the status of the experimental demee?

Inquisitor Drogan: The Power Source? It's running the entire Manufactorum from the generator room.

Captain Titus: This device is a fuel source, not a weapon?

Inquisitor Drogan: It is a complex device -- and an unstable one. If the Orks find it, they'll try and take it apart -- it could detonate with enough force to destroy the entire planet.

Captain Titus: Then we must mave it to safely.

Inquisitor Drogan: And for that, Captain, I need your aid. This way.

Captain Titus: You are wounded, Inquisitor Drogan.

Inquisitor Drogan: I am a psyker. My psychic abilities are controlling the bleeding.

Captain Titus: Very well.

[They leave the room when suddenly a seasoned Ork appears, mostly consisting of metal trash.]

Warboss: Space Marine! You trying to steal my Titans? Steal my loot? I'll rip your guts right out your throat! 

Inquisitor Drogan: The Ork himself!

Warboss: I'm gonna put your head on a spike, Space Marine.

[He sends a horde of Orks to deal with the squad.]

Warboss: Oy! Get out of there and kill this Space Marine! Now!!

Sergeant Sidonus: Aye--The Ork has a scent for us now.

Inquisitor Drogan: Damnable creature! Had he not blundered onto this world--

Captain Titus: But he did, Drogan.

Inquisitor Drogan: There -- We must get to that lift.

Ork Shaman: My boyz want to give you a proper greeting.

Sergeant Sidonus: How much deeper does this facility go?

Inquisitor Drogan: The Manufactorum? Far deeper. The whole generator room is actually suspended above a venting shaft.

Leandros: Suspended?

Inquisitor Drogan: Yes. In case of catastrophic overload, the whole room can be shunted away into the depths. Ah, yes. Here we are.

Sergeant Sidonus: Colder than a Space Wolf's smile in here.

Inquisitor Drogan: Yes. A by-product of the device's functioning. Captain Titus, proceed into the main chamber. We need only obtain the power source at the core of the generator. I will initiate decoupling from a control console.

Captain Titus: Understood. Brothers - guard the access points.

Inquisitor Drogan: I have engaged the decoupling sequence, captain. You must keep the chamber secure until the power source is exposed. There, the primary shield is open, Captain. Head into the central chamber.

Sergeant Sidonus: Captain! The Warboss!

Warboss: Space Marine! What you hiding down here? Whatever it is, I WANT IT! Go get it, boyz!

Inquisitor Drogan: Hold back the Greenskins, Captain. The power source will be free of the generator shortly.

Warboss: That's it! Tear this whole place apart! I'll rip your guts right out your throat! You can't run from me, Space Marine!

Inquisitor Drogan: Now head over to the Servitor station and activate it. It will retrieve the power source and get it into its canister.

Warboss: That does it, Space Marine! This sparky thing what you want, Space Marine? Then I'll take it for myself!

[He destroys mechanical clamps that were supposed to place the core in a protective container.]

Inquisitor Drogan: That damn ork will kill us all! Grab it Captain! Force the power source into its canister! Quickly!

[Captain takes the core with his bare hands and loses consciousness for a while. When he wakes up, he places the core in a container and takes it with him.]

Chapter 7: Heart of Darkness
Captain Titus: Sidonus. Leandros. Respond.

Leandros: (via comm) Captain? The Inquisitor insisted you could not have survived.

Captain Titus: Well, I did. And I have his precious power source.

Sergeant Sidonus: (via comm) We set a rendezvous in Hab Center Andris. These tunnels will spit us out there eventually.

Captain Titus: Fine. Continue heading toward the Hab Center.

[He alone makes his way through the sewer pipes and the Manufactorum ruins infested with Orks. After a series of brutal fights he reunites with his squad.]

Leandros: Captain Titus!

Captain Titus: Well met, brothers. Any idea of our position?

Sergeant Sidonus: We should be meaning an access point to the surface. The air smells a bit cleaner.

Captain Titus: I have had enough of tunnels. Let's get out of here and find the Inquisitor before the Orks do.

Sergeant Sidonus: More of them! Considerate of the green scum to open the way. At last - a way to the surface. Not much tidier than below, but at least we have the sky over our heads again. Our rendezvous point is this way.

Chapter 8: Whispers of the Dead
Leandros: What could the Orks hope to gain by slaughtering so many?

Sergeant Sidonus: Sow terror. Demoralize the militia.

Leandros: Cruel, but effective.

Captain Titus: This was no strategy of war. For Orks, this was sport.

[The squad goes out into the open and sees hundreds of Ork ships landing on the planet.]

Sergeant Sidonus: Millions more of them...

Captain Titus: Our plan is unchanged: Get the Inquisitor and the Power Source off world.

Sergeant Sidonus: Titus, if they take over the Manufactorum, we will have a damnable time getting them out.

Leandros: We are Ultramarines. Orks are not a problem.

Sergeant Sidonus: If we had a week, perhaps. But by then the Orks will have worked out how to dismantle the Titans. Ork rocket launchers on the high ground. The Xenos haven't left a single structure undamaged. Or unbloodied.

Captain Titus: Greenskins. More roks!

Sergeant Sidonus: Greenskins incoming!

Leandros: The techpriests will have to bring all of these struetures down, and rebuild.

Sergeant Sidonus: This time on top of a mass grave. There. Drogan said to meet at that monument.

Captain Titus: Inquisitor Drogan, we need to get your off planet before we're overrun by Orks.

Inquisitor Drogan: You were exposed to the unshielded Power Source... In the generator room -- I saw it! You held raw energy from the Warp... How are you still alive?

Sergeant Sidonus: The Power Source conducts Warp energies?

Leandros: The stuff of Chaos! Heresy --

Inquisitor Drogan: My work against the Xenos has the Imperium's blessing.

Captain Titus: Can your blessed work help us against the Orks?

Inquisitor Drogan: My research is of the utmost secrecy. The Imperium forbids its use without sanction.

[An Ork ship lands on the planet near the heroes.]

Captain Titus: Consider that your Imperial sanction.

Inquisitor Drogan: Very well. The Power Source fuels an experimental weapon at my research facility -- the Psychic Scourge. It could destroy the Orks.

Sergeant Sidonus: You didn't think to bring up this scourge weapon before?

Inquisitor Drogan: The Psychic Scourge has never been test-fired, Sergeant. If it malfunctions, it could crack this planet in half.

Captain Titus: We are out of options. We fire the weapon and take our chances.

Inquisitor Drogan: The Psychic Scourgetis at the Kalkys facility --my research laboratories. It is a fair distance. We will need transportation.

Sergeant Sidonus: Captain, we aren't far from the plaza where Lieutenant Mira was headed - the Imperial Guard rally point.

Captain Titus: They will have Valkyries. We can fly to the research facility. Let's find this Imperial Guard outpost.

[After several battles with the Orks, the heroes make a halt.]

Captain Titus: Inquistor, you wound is slowing us down.

Inquisitor Drogan: I can manage --

Captain Titus: Brothers -- take him to the Valkyries. I will draw the Orks off and meet you there.

Inquisitor Drogan: Give the Power Source to the Sergeant, then, Captain.

Captain Titus: No, Drogan. The Ork chieftain wanted the Power Source. When his Orks see I possess it, not you, they will follow me. Move out.

[Captain puts on a jetpack, picks up a hammer and begins to distract the Orks.]

Sergeant Sidonus: Whatever you're doing, Captain, keep at it. The Greenskins are swarming your way leaving our path open.

Soldier: (via comm) My lord... We owe you our lives.

Captain Titus: I am an instrument of the Emperor's will, trooper. Now indicate to me the nearest concentration of Orks.

Soldier: (via comm) Aye, my lord. Marsis Plaza is just past this hab complex. It is swarming with the beasts.

Captain Titus: Not for long.

Sergeant Sidonus: (via comm) Captain, we are within sight of the Imperial Guard bastion.

[Having destroyed a whole company of Orks, Titus moves on. He takes off his jetpack.]

Captain Titus: Out of fuel.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) This is Primus Command! Orks inside the perimeter! Move to secondary defense positions and hold the line!

[Captain Titus arrives at the bastion and meets a familiar face.]

Second Lieutenant Mira: Welcome to Bastion Frimus, Captain. Sergeant Sidonus briefed me about the Inquisitor and his doomsday weapon. He said you require air transport to the Kalkys facility.

Captain Titus: Your Valkyries are the fastest way to reach it. And we have no time to spare.

Second Lieutenant Mira: Your men are ready on board their Valkyrie, and the squadron's ready for lift off. We'll get you to Kalkys with all speed. It's time the Imperial Guard brought the fight to the Orks.

Chapter 9: The Weapon
[Captain Titus and his party fly the Valkyries to Kalkys.]

Second Lieutenant Mira: Pilots, this is Lieutenant Mira aboard Valkyrie One. Look sharp. Ork flyers inbound.

Soldier: (via comm) Captain Titus - I'll need a gunner to man the heavy bolter. Here they come! Starboard side!

[Titus protects the Valkyries with an onboard machine gun.]

Soldier: (via comm) Incoming! That was close!

Soldier 2: (via comm) Valkyrie Seven here! I've got boarders!

Captain Titus: Pilot! Maintain speed! I will shoot them off! Damned Orks. Stormboyz going for Valkyne Three-- Keep us in position, pilot!

Pilot: Trying, sir. Captain! Starboard side! Ork ship coming up! They're right behind us!

[Titus rips off the machine gun and kills the Orks who sneaked aboard. Ultimately, one of the Orks commits suicide by jumping into the engine and the Valkyrie falls. Captain Titus lands successfully on a dilapidated bridge.]

Captain Titus: Come in, Lieutenant. Valkyrie Two is down. I require immediate transport.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) We're on approach, Captain.

[On the bridge, the Orks have organized a whole military base and Titus has to just survive until the evac arrives.]

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) Valkyrie on approach.

Captain Titus: What is the Inquisitor's status?

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) The remainder of the squadron has escorted his craft to the outskirts of the Kalkys Facility.

Captain Titus: Very good.

[Mira evacuates Titus out of the hot zone.]

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) Farewell, Captain. I must return to base -- those damned Ork fliers cost me too many good men, and too many gunships-- We'll be hard-pressed to defend the outpast.

Captain Titus: Thank you and good luck, Lieutenant.

[Inquisitor Drogan and Titus' squad runs in.]

Inquisitor Drogan: Where is it?

Captain Titus: The device is secure, Drogan.

Inquisitor Drogan: What are you waiting for, then? For the delay is intolerable.

Captain Titus: Inquisitor -- are you all right?

Inquisitor Drogan: Yes. Come. We've no time to waste.

Sergeant Sidonus: More of them!

Inquisitor Drogan: Dispatch them quickly! We must hurry!

Captain Titus: Inquisitor - can we get around the bulk of these Orks?

Inquisitor Drogan: Yes, perhaps. My research produces minimal waste, so the facility's sluiceways should be accessible.

Captain Titus: Lead the way.

Inquisitor Drogan: Captain, my servitors were destroyed in the initial attack. I may need your helps to activate the Psychic Scourge.

Captain Titus: How large is the weapon?

Inquisitor Drogan: The firing mechanism is at my research lab. But the energy pulse itself travels along conduits from the lab to the orbital spire. There. We will proceed through that door. I need time to override the lock, Captain.

Captain Titus: Understood, Inquisitor.

[The squad protects the inquisitor while he opens the lock.]

Inquisitor Drogan: Through here, Space Marines.

Leandros: I thought the spire to be a ground-to-space transporter.

Inquisitor Drogan: It is. With a few modifications. It also makes an ideal firing tower. The energy pulse shouldn't damage the spire...

Sergeant Sidonus: You do not sound confident.

Inquisitor Drogan: Improvisation and experimentation go hand in hand. These pipes lead into the facility's sub basements.

Sergeant Sidonus: And here is our entrance.

Chapter 10: House of Secrets
Captain Titus: What can we expect inside, Inquisitor?

Inquisitor Drogan: Oh, yes. Just a few defenses.

Sergeant Sidonus: What cumprises "a few," Inquisitor?

Inquisitor Drogan: Servo-turrets, mostly.

Sergeant Sidonus: Set to eliminate Orks?

Inquisitor Drogan: Set to eliminate anything with the misfortune to move within their range.

Leandros: Sentry guns ahead! Missile launcher!

Sergeant Sidonus: No way to move quickly with these guns everywhere. We need to shut them all down.

Inquisitor Drogan: I can do that from the central security room.

Captain Titus: Then that is where we are headed.

Inquisitor Drogan: Ultramarines. The logic engine thinks we are escaped Xenos specimens. There is a control panel in the side room-- Get me there and I can shut it down.

Computer: Authorization recognized. Protocols suspended.

Inquisitor Drogan: The exit will open shortly, Captain. However, I'm afraid the servo turrets beyond this room remain primed.

Leandros: What is kept in these containers?

Inquisitor Drogan: Specimens needed for my research.

Sergeant Sidonus: Specimens, cages, operating theatres… This place reeks of Xenos filth.

Inquisitor Drogan: That is the business of the Inquisition, Ultramarines. This way, Ultramarines. The firing core is still active. Excellent.

Leandros: If this is the firing core, Inquisitor, does it discharge through the whole facility?

Inquisitor Drogan: No, not precisely. The core actually raises to the rooftop of the facility. That is where the rest of the firing array is located. There! The command room is beyond those doors.

Sergeant Sidonus: And those sentry guns.

Inquisitor Drogan: Ah, very good. All the security measures will be down shortly, Captain. I'm afraid they were the only thing keeping the Orks outside, however.

Captain Titus: But you will be able to fire the weapon?

Inquisitor Drogan: Indeed.

Sergeant Sidonus: We had better do so quickly. This place will be awash with Orks before long.

Inquisitor Drogan: Of course. Security systems disabled. Please proceed to the generator room.

Sergeant Sidonus: Here come the Orks.

Inquisitor Drogan: (via comm) Place the canister into its cradle inside the power core, Captain.

Captain Titus: Do we risk exposure again?

Inquisitor Drogan: (via comm) Only if you drop the canister. Ah, very good, Captain. Your time carrying my power source is finally at an end.

[Suddenly, something goes wrong. The weapon refuses to fire.]

Inquisitor Drogan: (via comm) DAMNABLE THING!

Captain Titus: What do you need me to do, Inquisitor?

Inquisitor Drogan: (via comm) You will need to manually restart the array alignment. Forcibly, if you must.

Captain Titus: Where?

Inquisitor Drogan: (via comm) In the firing chamber. Board the lift, Ultramarines. Captain! You must hurry! The damned Orks have cut the main conduits to the firing tower! You must reconnect the conduits, Captain, or we're facing an overload that will rip this planet apart.

Captain Titus: Understood.

Leandros: The chamber is infested!

Captain Titus: Clear it out! No mercy! Inquisitor - The conduits are reconnected.

Inquisitor Drogan: (via comm)  Now proceed to the main control panel.

[The weapon fires a thick purple Ray of light at the spire and breaks it in half. Only because of the force fields it stands and not collapse.]

Leandros: Look at the spire.

[A small ship with the Warboss on it flies up to the Ultramarines.]

Warboss: I've been looking for you, Space Marine. You got something of mine!

[He pulls the Power Source out of the socket and it explodes. All those who were nearby lose consciousness. After a while, everyone comes to their senses. The Orks are still alive.]

Leandros: (to Captain Titus) Why didn't it work?

Sergeant Sidonus: Damn that Drogan! Never trust the Inquisition!

Sergeant Sidonus: Stand fast, Ultramarines. We can handle a few Orks.

Warboss: Space Marine! Was that supposed to hurt? 

[A purple portal opens from which demons run out with red swords. They kill the Orks.]

Leandros: Chaos daemons? How is this possible...

Warboss: (firing) You got new friends now, Space Marine?

[The demons attack him in a crowd and he falls off the platform. Elite Chaos Space Marine appears from the portal. Not far from him, Drogan takes the elevator to the platform.]

Captain Titus: Inquisitor, get back!

[Chaos Space Marine paralyses the squad.]

Chaos Space Marine: How heroic.

Captain Titus: Drogain!

[The Inquisitor walks to the Chaos Space Marine. No demons lift a finger on him.]

Inquisitor Drogan: I have served you well, Lord Nemeroth.

Captain Titus: Traitor.

[Lord Nemeroth consumes Inquisitor Drogan.]

Lord Nemeroth: I see. My servant did all that I hoped, and more. But he would never have succeeded without you… ...Captain Titus. Thanks to these brave Space Marines, we have broken through to this reality. The blessed gateway is not yet large enough. Clever fool. You seem surprisingly able to resist my touch, Titus of the Ultramarines. And that of the Warp, which impressed my servant to no end. Ah-- you the inquisitor a traitor. But Drogan has been dead since before you first met. You have been used by my puppet of flesh and bone.

Suddenly, the Warboss jumps onto the platform.

Warboss: I ain't so easy to kill!

[He attacks Chaosite. They fight briefly and fall off the platform together.]

Leandros: Emperor protect us--

Sergeant Sidonus: We need an exit.

Captain Titus: To the lift!

[They break through the hordes of demons at the elevator.]

Leandros: Did that fiend speak truth? Did we cause a Chaos invasion?

Sergeant Sidonus: Of course we did. His inquisitor puppet manipulated us from the moment we met.

Leandros: And before! The false Inquisitor sent the distress call --

Captain Titus: I don't think so, Leandros. The man's urgency, his fear… I believe that was the real Drogan, facing certain death.

Sergeant Sidonus: And it found him.

Captain Titus: But not at the Orks' hands. Somehow, the agents of Chaos were already here.

[Below appears to be as hot as the above.]

Leandros: Captain -

Captain Titus: Keep moving! Down this way! To the exit! Keep moving!

Chapter 11: Point of No Return
[The squad escapes the facility.]

Sergeant Sidonus: That gate--it's getting bigger. If it gets much larger, Nemeroth can bring his fleet through.

Captain Titus: Then we must cut the link between Warpgate and tower.

Sergeant Sidonus: You have a plan?

Captain Titus: We use Invictus to sever the orbital spire.

Sergeant Sidonus: At that range, will the Titan's cannon be effective?

Captain Titus: It's time we use the power source to our advantage to supercharge Invictus. We need to reach that Titan.

Sergeant Sidonus: So, a daemon killed inquisitor Drogan and then possessed his body. But why?

Captain Titus: Alone, there was no way the daemon could get the power source past a million Orks. It needed help.

Leandros: And we obliged.

Captain Titus: I was deceived. I am responsible for Chaos breaking through to this world.

[They're crushing the demons for some time.]

Leandros: Captain, duty requires that I put voice to my concerns.

Captain Titus: Speak, then.

Leandros: You held the unshielded power since again, Captain. And again, you emerged from the exposure unscathed. The Codex Astartes warns that those in league with Chaos can withstand the Warp's touch.

Sergeant Sidonus: You forget yourself, Ultramarine --

Captain Titus: Leandros, I do not take this Warp resistance lightly. But the search for answers must wait until after we deal with this Chaos invasion.

Leandros: What if that is too late?

Sergeant Sidonus: Leandros, enough. We need to keep moving.

Chapter 12: Dying of the Light
Captain Titus: Warp portal!

Chaos Marine: Kill the weak!

Captain Titus: Brothers - Attack!

[They save a group of guardsmen.]

Captain Titus: Guardsman - Report.

Guardsman: My lord Space Marine… They were on us almost immediately.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) Captain Titus, are you there? This is Lieutenant Mira. This whole planet has gone mad!

Captain Titus: The forces of Chaos are invading this world. We must get to the Titan and destiny that Warp gate.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) I know what route to take deployed troops to man outposts between the Kalkys facility and Bastion Primus. From there, you can access the rail network and cross to Manufactorum Ajakis.

Captain Titus: Understood. I will meet you there.

Sergeant Sidonus: An Ork invasion, and now the tender mercies of Chaos heretics. I am surprised the place is standing at all.

[The squad descend by elevator to Mira's location. ]

Soldier: How... How can we face them… The Legions of Chaos...

Second Lieutenant Mira: Trooper! Get yourself together right now!

Soldier: Yes, ma’am.

Second Lieutenant Mira: The other platoons are going to fall back toward the Bastion. Hold this position, or they'll be cut off. Greetings, Ultramarines.

Captain Titus: What is your situation, Lieutenant?

Second Lieutenant Mira: As well as can be hoped, considering we are surrounded on all sides by the enemy horde. We're heading back to the command post, Captain.

Sergeant Sidonus: And once again, we find the Orks in our path.

Captain Titus: Not for long. There's a lift over here.

[They are taking over the Orks' foothold.]

Soldier: Well met, Mira!

Second Lieutenant Mira: Jonah! Thalf expected to find a daemon chewing on your bones.

Jonah: They'd spit me right out...

Second Lieutenant Mira: Make your report, Jonah.

Jonah: The Greenskins have been pressing us hard-- Both down here and at the bastion proper.

Second Lieutenant Mira: Get ready to fall back to the bastion. Do not engage Chaos forces directly until I get reinforcements down here to back you up.

Jonah: Aye, Lieutenant!

Second Lieutenant Mira: Captain Titus - this way.

Guardsman: (via comm) Lieutenant Mira, this is Bastion Primus. We're under heavy assault -- the Orks are back. And they cut power to the sentry guns!

Second Lieutenant Mira: All of them?

Guardsman: (via comm) They took out the generator. We couldn't defend it against such numbers -- we had to fall back.

Second Lieutenant Mira: The Ultramarines and I are almost at your position. Mira, out.

Captain Titus: Orks. Always more Orks. Forward!

Second Lieutenant Mira: Imperial Guard! Stand your ground! The Ultramarines are here!

Guardsman: Aye, Lieutenant!

Second Lieutenant Mira: You can see why we need the sentry guns. There aren't enough of us to hold this position without them.

Guardsman: Lieutenant, the central outpost is under attack.

Second Lieutenant Mira: Tell them were on our way!

Captain Titus: Move out, bruthers.

Second Lieutenant Mira: We need those sentry guns.

Captain Titus: Lieutenant, where is the generator?

Second Lieutenant Mira: If you continue on, you'll find it at the end of our fortifications.

Captain Titus: I will contact you once I have restored power. Brothers the Guardsmen will need your help until the guns are reactivated.

Sergeant Sidonus: We will hold the line, Captain.

Captain Titus: Lieutenant Mira, the generator is at full power.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) It's working the sentry guns are back online! Captain your men are near an access point to the rail network. My Guardsmen will point the way. Another gateway is close to your position.

Captain Titus: My thanks Lieutenant.

Guardsman: Here we are, my lord.

Captain Titus: Carry on Guardsman.

Sergeant Sidonus: (via comm) Sidonus to Captain Titus. We are running into Orks down here. Meaning upo above, though. Nothing like above, though. Just enough to be an annoyance. We will be there soon.

Captain Titus: Understood.

[On the way towards the rail station, Captain Titus meets the Warboss. He grabs him and throws in a small pit.]

Warboss: You think you can walk out of here with that sparky thing? I'm Boss Grimskull! This whole planet is mine! Why do you give me so much trouble, Space Marine? I ain't finished with you yet, Space Marine!

Captain Titus: But I am finished with you, Ork.

[He kills the Warboss by firing his plasma gun at his head point-blank.]

Sergeant Sidonus: (via comm) Captain?

Captain Titus: The damned Ork is dead.

Sergeant Sidonus: (via comm) Finally, some good news.

Leandros: This rail line will take us directly to the Titan Manufactorum.

Sergeant Sidonus: The faster, the better. Those Orks slowed us down.

Captain Titus: And gave Nemeroth time to prepare his invasion. We must get to the Titan and destroy that Warp gate.

Chapter 13: Wake the Sleeping Giant
Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) Captain Titus, the Orks are running scared. What's happened?

Sergeant Sidonus: The Captain dealt with their Warboss once and for all.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) We have a chance now...

Captain Titus: Bolster your defenses. The daemon host will not be so easy to frighten off.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) Good luck, Titus. All our hopes are with you.

Soldier: (via comm) Ultramarines. This is Princeps Enoch aboard Titan Invictus.

Captain Titus: This is Captain Titus. What is the status of the Titan?

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) My crew and I are aboard Invictus, but shots immobilized. You will need to activate our bentis backup generator to release the mooring clamps.

Captain Titus: Understood.

Sergeant Sidonus: There it is.

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) That did it, Ultramarines! If you can release our mooring clamps, we can bring devastation to the invaders. The renegades have it well guarded.

Captain Titus: Understood.

Sergeant Sidonus: That elevator will get us to the mooring clamp controls.

Captain Titus: I will take care of the clamps. You and Leandros get the doors to the Manufactorum open.

Sergeant Sidonus: Understood, Captain.

Captain Titus: Enoch, I have inquisitor Drogan's power source with me. We must use it to supercharge your weaponry.

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) The power source? The rites involved in using it safely... Only the High Fabricator himself --

Captain Titus: Unless we act now an entire Chaos fleet will hang over your Forge World.

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) Understood. Mooring clamps released. Invictus powering up now.

Captain Titus: My battle brothers will have the gates open shortly. Maneuver Invictus close to the topmost gantries. I am coming aboard.

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) Yes, Captain.

Captain Titus: Enoch -- I have a target for you the Orbital Spire.

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) The spire… But Captain, it is a masterwork of the Machine God...

Captain Titus: It is feeding energy into the Warp Gate above it. If we are to stop this invasion the spire must fall.

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) I understand.

Captain Titus: Where must I bring the power source?

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) Travel across the armature to the starboard side, Captain. I will open a maintenance apse for the volcano cannon.

Voice of Gracia: Protocols suspended. Access authorized.

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) The apse is below you, Captain. Leap down to the walkways around the volcano cannon, Captain.

Voice of Graia: Power source successfully integrated.

Captain Titus: Target the Orbital Spire.

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) Target acquired.

Voice of Graia: Firing now.

[The Titan releases an unprecedented stream of energy capable of destroying an entire planet.]

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) Omnissiah preserve us...

Chapter 14: Victory and Sacrifice
[The spire shatters into pieces but they are still held by some kind of force field!]

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) Captain... All systems are overloading... Did it work?

Captain Titus: Invictus performed admirably, Enoch. The Warp Gate is closing.

Princeps Enoch: (via comm) Thank the Machine-God.

Voice of Graia: Shutting down all systems…

[Captain reunites with the rest of the squad.]

Sergeant Sidonus: That's done it, Titus.

Captain Titus: But Nemeroth and his daemon host still roam free.

Sergeant Sidonus: Though he is trapped on this world.

Captain Titus: And all the more desperate to recover the power source. We must get it to safety, old friend.

Leandros: Good news on that front. Lieutenant Mira reports that the Liberation Fleet has entered the system. The Inquisition will surely have sent agents with the fleet, Captain. Perhaps we can return the device to them--

Captain Titus: The Inquisition has already failed to stop its exploitation by Chaos. No one must use the device, Leandros, ever again. Contact Lieutenant Mira and have her divert a Valkyrie here to pick us up.

Leandros: Yes, Captain.

Sergeant Sidonus: I suppose putting a bolter round through that damnable power source is out of the question.

Captain Titus: Too risky -- we could open another Warp Gate for all we know. Upon our return to Macragge, I will confide it to the Chapter Master and his Librarians.

Sergeant Sidonus: And until then?

Captain Titus: My most trusted brother will bring it to our Strike Cruiser and seal it in the armory.

[He hands the power source to Sidonus.]

Captain Titus: Get this damned thing secured, Sergeant.

Sergeant Sidonus: As quickly as I can. And what will you be doing while I run this little errand?

Captain Titus: There are still thousands of traitors and heretics on this world. I intend to drastically thin their ranks.

Leandros: Lieutenant Mira's Valkyrie is on its way, Captain.

Captain Titus: Excellent. We make for the landing pad, and watch for the Chaos Lord's forces.

Chaos Space Marine: There! Retrieve the Warp Device!

Captain Titus: Sidonus! Get to the Landing Pad!

Sergeant Sidonus: Aye, captain!

[He leaves and Titus provides cover for his escape.]

Sergeant Sidonus: (via comm) These Traitors are determined-- And this landing pad does not offer much cover.

[Nemeroth appears from the portal and kills Sidonius, piercing him distracted by the enemies from behind.]

Captain Titus: Sidonus!

Lord Nemeroth: At last!

Captain Titus: No!

[Titus runs towards Sidonus. Nemeroth paralyses him and takes the power source.]

Lord Nemeroth: Such a pretty bauble, hiding such immense power. This device is a gift from the Chaos gods. It holds the key to my evolution... to my ascension to immortal daemonhood. My armies will spill humanity's blood across the stars. You continue to resist my touch.... Only a deep connection to the Warp can explain this. Will you be joining us soon... brother?

[He leaves through a portal.]

Leandros: I couldn't reach him in time…

Captain Titus: Sidonus died as we all should -- in righteous battle. Do not give in to grief, Leandros. Turn your thoughts to vengeance. Nemeroth will pay in blood.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) Mira here. Valkyrie on approach. Captain Titus - We're ready to transport you.

[She approaches the Ultramarines.]

Second Lieutenant Mira: The Sergeant!

Captain Titus: That Traitor Lord murdered him.

[They lean over the body of Sidonius.]

Captain Titus: Nemeroth killed Sidonus for the Power Source. You said the Inquisitor's work was heretical, Leandros -- You were right.

Leandros: What do you mean?

Captain Titus: Nemeroth plans to use the Power Source to trigger his transformation into a daemon prince.

Leandros: Abomination...

Second Lieutenant Mira: How can we stand against such a creature?

Captain Titus: I will kill Nemeroth when he is most vulnerable: during the transformation. Safeguard Sidonus until the Apothecary arrives. Then join the Imperial attack.

Leandros: Going alone is suicide. Or worse - we know the enemy takes great interest in your connection to Chaos --

Captain Titus: Do you fear my falling to Chaos?

Leandros: Of course not. But whatever lies behind your resistance, it can only be to the enemy's favor.

Second Lieutenant Mira: Why? Perhaps this resistance can get you close enough for a killing blow.

Captain Titus: I will destroy Nemeroth with skill and steel, or die trying. If this 'resistance' comes into play during battle, so be it.

Leandros: So be it.

Chapter 15: Prince of Daemons
Captain Titus: I must reach the orbital spire.

Second Lieutenant Mira: Farewell, Captain.

[The captain goes to the spire, destroying the chaos in his path.]

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) Captain Titus - The liberation fleet is in orbit. Fresh troops are landing preparing to assault the orbital spire.

Captain Titus: It may be severed, but it is still the enemy's strong point.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) The fleet is preparing an all out assault.

Captain Titus: Their attack will not be enough to stop the forces of Chaos.

Second Lieutenant Mira: (via comm) I know. Good luck, Titus.

[Titus fights through hordes of demons, chopping with an axe and blasting them with machine gun fire.]

Chapter 16: Spire of Madness
Captain Titus: Ultramarines, this is Captain Titus.

Thunderhawk: (via comm) Captain Titus! Thunderhawk Lance of Jove is at your disposal, Captain.

Captain Titus: I must reach the orbital spire. Tell your pilot to make his approach.

Thunderhawk: (via comm) Yes, sir!

Ultramarine: (via comm) Blood Ravens Squad Corvus reporting in, Captain Titus. We joined the Liberation Fleet at Bakka, along with a squad of Black Templars.

Captain Titus: Unleash the fury you showed in the Aurelian Crusade, and we will be glad to have even a few Blood Ravens with us.

Ultramarine: (via comm) You may rely on that, Captain.

Captain Titus: Then join the forces driving into the daemon host. And stop any enemies trying to follow me up the orbital spire.

Ultramarine: (via comm) None shall find us wanting, Ultramarine.

Captain Titus: Honor and glory, Blood Raven. Attack! Forward! Keep moving. Remain alert.

[Titus leading the Blood Ravens. Together they unleash the wrath of Imperium on the heads of the heretics.]

Blood Raven: Your orders, Captain?

Captain Titus: Destroy these Chaos forces. I must reach the orbital spire.

Blood Raven: Yes, sir! Captain Titus! Squad Solinus, reporting in: Manufactorum Narses is secure.

Captain Titus: Very good.

Blood Raven: Your orders, Captain?

Captain Titus: Contain the Chaos threat here.

Blood Raven: Understood.

Thunderhawk Pilot: Thunderhawk ready for transport, Captain Titus.

Captain Titus: I will need all your skill, pilot.

Thunderhawk Pilot: I will take you into the Eye of Terror if you ask it, Captain.

Captain Titus: The Orbital Spire will do for today, brother.

[He gets on the ship and flies to the spire. Soon he jumps off the cargo bay with a jetpack on his shoulders.]

Thunderhawk Pilot: I will hold here as long as I can, Captain.

Captain Titus: No, brother. Rejoin our forces and bring fury to the enemy. This battle is mine alone.

Thunderhawk Pilot: Yes, sir!

Captain Titus: (to Nemeroth) This madness will not stop me! And neither will you!

Chaos Space Marine: There! Kill the Loyalist!

Captain Titus: Your brothers thought the same, Traitor. Their corpses lie behind me.

[Soon Titus reaches the top levels if the spire.]

Captain Titus: Out of fuel.

[He takes a giant elevator to the top.]

Captain Titus: There is much blood on your hands, Nemeroth. For all those you have killed... for Sidonus... and for the Emperor, I will finish this.

Chapter 17: Man Against Daemon
[He finds Nemeroth already chanting the spell.]

Lord Nemeroth: Dread Gods of Chaos... I am Nemeroth, your herald and champion! I have burned a thousand worlds in your dark names! You challenged me to recover this fragment of your power, and I have done so! The slaves of the False Emperor who dared claim it as their own lie dead at my hand! I return your dark relic to you... I offer up this world and all those upon it.

Captain Titus: You want to talk to your gods? I will send you to them!

Lord Nemeroth: Admit it, Titus. The power of Chaos is within you calling to this relic. Imagine the ultramarines dominating this galaxy in glorious conquest, with you at their head. Imagine the power you could wield--as a slave to Chaos?

Captain Titus: Nothing you say can tempt me from the path of honor -- or from avenging the deaths of my battle brothers.

[The battle begins. Nemeroth sends countless demons to kill just one Ultramarine.]

Lord Nemeroth: You are no threat to me now, Ultramarine. Nothing can stop my ascension! Grant me your favor! Corrupt my flesh, make me daemonkind! Show this fool the true nature of power! Have you looked to the skies lately, Captain Titus? You opened a gateway to the Chaos realm, Captain. Already our legions are pouring through. The slave of the False Emperor was trying to save this planet from one invasion. Instead, he ushered in another. Your pathetic Imperial forces will be scoured clean from this world. Soon, my entire invasion fleet will cross into this reality! Your task is hopeless, Titus. I have the will of the Dark Gods behind me. But you? You have no one. And you will die here, alone.

[The ascension of Numeroth is finished. He's now a Daemon Prince.]

Lord Nemeroth: Killing my servants matters little. I am unassailable. The gods of Chaos project me with the very energies of creation.

Captain Titus: You forget, Nemeroth. I am no stranger to the touch of the Warp!

[He pushes Nemeroth off the spire and flies down with him. The fight does not stop even in the fall. Ultimately, Titus crushes Nemeroth's head like a watermelon.]

Lord Nemeroth: (in Titus head) Will you be joining us soon... brother?

[Titus catches the power supply and breaks it, creating a massive explosion. We see the Thunderhawk flying in the direction of the explosion.]

Chapter 18: Epilogue
Second Lieutenant Mira: Look there, Ultramarine -- you have saved this world.

[Titus appears to be Injured but alive.]

Second Lieutenant Mira: I see that the Ultramarines are human, after all.

Captain Titus: More than you know, Lieutenant.

[A Thunderhawk lands near him.]

Second Lieutenant Mira: The damned Inquisition is here.

Inquisitor: His injuries appear Chaos-inflicted. You are certain of this charge?

Leandros: Captain Titus has been corrupted by Chaos, Inquisitor Thrax.

Captain Titus: (strictly) I am no heretic.

Leandros: You lie! Only an agent of Chaos could withstand such Warp Exposure --

Captain Titus: I sent the daemon to oblivion.

Inquisitor Thrax: But did you have unholy assistance? We must know. You will submit to my authority, Captain. Or the Inquisition must conclude that you have corrupted every Ultramarine under your command... ...Not to mention those who stand at your side.

Second Lieutenant Mira: Ignore his threats. Come on --

Captain Titus: The Inquisition will destroy you, Mira. And the Ultramarines will be forever dishonored… Leave my brothers -- and the Lieutenant -- alone. I will come with you. I do not know why I can resist the touch of Chaos, but swear I will discover the truth.

Inquisitor Thrax: We will discover many truths, Space Marine...

Leandros: The Codex Astartes leaves no room for doubt: You cannot touch the Warp and emerge unscathed.

Captain Titus: The Codex Astartes is a set of rules. They guide us... shape us as Ultramarines… teach us to hold duty and honor sacred above all. But how we live with those rules is the true test of a Space Marine. And you have failed.

[Captain Titus steps aboard the inquisition ship. He takes one last look at Mira and Leandros before the hatch slams shut.]

Planetary invasion - CONTAINED

Strategic assets - SECURED

Ongoing Status - QUARANTINED BY ORDER OF INQUISITOR THRAX
