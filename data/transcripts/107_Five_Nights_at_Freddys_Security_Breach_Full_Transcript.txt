FAZBEAR ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS

Five Nights at Freddy's
SECURITY BREACH
Intercom: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, Fazbear Entertainment would like you to put your hands together for the one and only Freddy Fazbear!

Opening
[Fazbear and friends walk onstage performing as their names appear.]

Montgomery Gator

Roxanne Wolf

Glamrock Chica

Freddy Fazbear

[During the performance, Freddy notices something.]

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT!

[Freddy falls down on stage and everything cuts to black.]

[Freddy turns back on.]

SAFE MODE

[He is looking at himself in front of the mirror.]

Freddy: Showtime already? I am experiencing a malfunction. The recharge cycle is not complete.

???: Shh! Will you shut up?!

Freddy: Who said that?

???: I did! I'm down here!

Freddy: Down where? I still do not see you.

???: Ok listen, you were sleeping so I opened the stomach hatch and climbed inside.

Freddy: My stomach hatch? That place is reserved for oversized birthday cakes and piñatas! It is not a safe play area!

[Freddy lets the kid out of the stomach hatch.]

Freddy: There you are.

[Freddy scans the kid.]

Freddy: Scanning complete. How odd. Your guest profile is unknown to me. Who are you?

???: I-I'm Gregory.

Freddy: Gregory, I will notify the main office. Huh, connection error. I cannot connect to the main network.

Gregory: It's her. She cut you off. She's not going to let you call for help until she finds me.

Freddy: Who? Who is looking for you? Your mother?

Gregory: Shh! I hear footsteps.

[Gregory walks towards the curtains and sees the security guard.]

Freddy: That is the security guard. She can help!

Gregory: No! No, I don't trust her.

Freddy: Why not?

Gregory: I don't know who she is but she's trying to get me. Isn't there some other way for you to communicate with me besides talking so loudly?

Freddy: Take this. It is a novelty Freddy Fazwatch.

[Freddy opens his stomach hatch to reveal a present inside, Gregory opens the present and is given the Fazwatch.]

Gregory: What was that?

Freddy: I am sending you an encoded message.

[Gregory opens his Fazwatch.]

Freddy: Hello Gregory. It is me Freddy. I will escort you to the main entrance. However, I am unable to leave this room. You should have no problem. There is a button on the wall that will open the door to the back room. I will make it accessible to you now. 

[Gregory finds the button.]

Freddy: Well done Gregory. There is an open air vent inside the maintenance room. You will have to climb through the system and release me from the outside.

[Gregory enters the back room.]

Gregory: It's pretty dark in there.

Freddy: There is nothing to be scared of. You can do it.

[Gregory climbs up into the air vent and crawls around, he sees the other animatronics.]

[Roxanne talks to herself in the mirror.]

Roxanne: Your performance was perfect tonight! Thank you! Your hair is beautiful! Your tail is beautiful! Everyone was watching you! Everyone loves you! You are the best! Thank you. I am the best. I am the best.

[Gregory hears Montgomery smashing things in his room in anger.]

[Gregory sees Chica practicing her guitar and then he finds the exit and hops out.]

 Exiting the room
Intercom: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for visiting and we hope you enjoyed the show! Freddy and the gang are pretty tired but they'll be back again next week after a few days of scheduled maintenance! Please make your way to the front of the building where you will be given novelty glasses, a voucher for one free soda refill and where you will sign a legal disclaimer releasing us of all liability for anything that might have happened during your visit. Have an awesome night and we'll see you again soon!

[Gregory finds Freddy's room and tries to open the door.]

Gregory: The stupid door won't open.

Freddy: Oh? You are going to need a Photo Pass to open the door. Apologies, I assumed you had one already... Well, you should be able to find one at a convenience counter.

[Gregory heads towards the convenience counter and opens a present to find the Photo Pass.]

Freddy: Good job! Now, please come let me out.

[Gregory goes back and opens the door.]

Freddy: Way to go superstar! I knew you could do it! I know how to get you out of here. Climb back into my chest cavity. There is still time but we must hurry, if I am spotted I will certainly be taken back to my room. I will escort you to the main exit through the utility tunnels, it is the safest path.

Gregory: Ok. But you better be careful moving around, I don't want to be crushed and twisted into a meat pretzel.

[Gregory goes inside Freddy's chest cavity and they head towards the utility tunnels.]

???: Hello? Little boy? If you're down here say something!

Gregory: She's down here, we have to go back.

Freddy: Do not worry Gregory. Even if we are spotted, you are safe with me. She would never suspect we are traveling together. However we should still do our best to avoid her. If I am sent back to my room, we will never get to the lobby before midnight.

[2 beeps are heard as Freddy goes down.]

Freddy: I feel you are broken.

Gregory: Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

Freddy: No, I feel that something is wrong, I am taking you to the first aid station.

Gregory: There's no time! I'm fine!

[Freddy ignores Gregory and runs towards a first aid station.]

[Freddy forces Gregory to get out and Gregory goes inside a first aid station.]

[The Security Guard confronts Freddy.]

???: Freddy! You're supposed to be on lockdown.

Freddy: Officer Vanessa! I do not know how I got here!

Vanessa: Well you totally blew it tonight you know. Your system crashed and you ruined the show. Now Parts and Service have you on reduced power! They said it's a safety precaution. Just one more thing to deal with...

Freddy: I apologize.

Vanessa: Ok... Look, we're like 15 minutes from closing and some kid is sneaking around backstage. If you see anything notify me immediately, I already alerted the others. Now go back to your room.

[As Vanessa exits the room Gregory comes out of the first aid station.] 

Gregory: I told you she was after me.

Freddy: I said nothing, I will keep you safe. Let us go.

[Gregory goes back into Freddy.]

[They walk around.]

Gregory: Where are we?

Freddy: We are now under the Pizzaplex. These utility tunnels connect all the attractions.

Gregory: We can go anywhere in the building?

Freddy: Correct. Fazer Blast, Monty Golf, Roxy Raceway, they are all accessible to S.T.A.F.F - with high enough clearance of course. Guests are never allowed down here but yours is a... special situation.

[As Freddy walks he runs out of power, he lets Gregory out of the chest cavity.]

Freddy: I am terribly sorry. The recharge cycle had not yet completed when I found you. You must continue without me. I will guide you on your Fazwatch in case you get into any trouble.

[Freddy goes into the recharge station.]

Gregory: I don't know if I can do this alone!

 Freddy Recharges

[Gregory checks the Fazwatch.]

Get Out.

◻️ Get to the main lobby of the Pizzaplex.
◻️ Find the Lobby.

[Gregory runs and walks near a bathroom, he opens the door and sees Chica eating garbage.]

Gregory: It's Chica. Maybe I could distract her with something.

[Gregory knocks over some paint buckets.]

Chica: Bawk Buck?

[Gregory crouches down and sneaks past Chica.]

Chica: This area is off limits.

[Gregory manages to sneak past her and walks towards a hallway.]

[As he enters this hallway Montgomery Gator smashes a fenced off area and chase Gregory.]

Monty: There you are!

[Gregory runs and goes to a corner, he sees Roxanne and goes the other way.]

Roxanne: Are you lost?

[Gregory runs up and Chica is behind him also.]

Chica: Lost boy over here!

[Gregory runs up the stairs and enters a Security office.]

Freddy: Well done Gregory. You found a security office. You should be quite safe here. The doors were designed to keep out our highly-trained security staff safe in the event of an emergency. As long as the doors stay close which they will, as long as there is ample power...

Gregory: Freddy, the power is only at 15% and they're pounding on the door! How am I gonna get out of here?

Freddy: Do not panic. You should see an interface on the security desk. Hold on while I make it accessible to you... there. You can now activate security protocols.

[Gregory pushes a button.]

Freddy: Your Fazwatch is now connected to the Security camera system. Check the map on your Fazwatch.

Freddy: Those boxes on your mini map are nearby security cameras. When movement is detected by the camera's motion sensors, you should see red alert icons. Switch between cameras to find a safe path out of the office and to the main lobby.

[Gregory checks the cameras and sees Chica leave.]

[He then checks his Fazwatch.]

Get Out.

◻️ Get to the main lobby of the Pizzaplex.
◻️ Find the Lobby.
◻️ Connect to the security system.
◻️ Find a safe path to the Main Entrance.

[He exits out of the security office from the right door.]

In the Lobby
[He sneaks out and makes it near the entrance.]

Intercom: Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex is now closed. Initiating nightime protocols.

[Gregory sees the exit close infront of him.]

Gregory: No! No! Wait! I'm still here! Now what am I suppose to do?

Freddy: How unfortunate Gregory. You miss your chance but there is still hope. You should be able to escape when the security doors reopen at 6:00am. Until then, keep moving and try not to draw attention to yourself, there is another way out. I will help you find it. I promise.

[Gregory walks around and finds a Complimentary Entry Pass and he enters the Lobby.]

Freddy: Well done, superstar. You have accessed the Lobby. Unfortunately that complimentary entry ticket does not allow you to enter the pizzeria.

Freddy: You can find an Upgrade machine in Customer Service.

[Gregory checks his Fazwatch.]

No Re-entry.

◻️ Upgrade Comp Pass at Upgrade Machine.

[As Gregory checks the Fazwatch a Security Bot jumps at him and an alarm rings.]

[Gregory runs, he sees Chica chasing him.]

Chica: Who wants candy?

[Gregory hides upstairs and he checks the cameras, he then goes to Glamrock Gifts, he sees Chica go upstairs.]

Chica: This area is off limits. Let me take you to your parents. our family is looking for you. Our friendly security staff can help.

[Gregory enters Glamrock Gifts and goes downstairs to find a Free Mystery Prize!]

[Gregory opens the prize.]

Gregory: Freddy, I found the free gift! Uh, it's a crappy Mr. Hippo fridge magnet? Lame.

Freddy: I am sorry Gregory. I am truly sorry.

[Gregory sneaks around and finds an Upgrade Machine.]

Chica: Where are you? Employees only. This area is off limits.

[Gregory puts his pass in.]

Gregory: It ate my pass!

Freddy: Try that terrible magnet you found.

[Gregory puts the crappy Mr. Hippo Magnet on the Upgrade Machine and it glitches the machine.]

Gregory: Yes! The magnet scrambled the machine! Aw man. Now it's some kind of Daycare Pass?

Freddy: That is great news! I will meet you in the daycare. The entrance is on the second floor balcony.

[Gregory checks his Fazwatch.]

No Re-entry.

◻️ Upgrade Comp Pass at Upgrade Maxhinw.
◻️ Hack the Upgrade Machine.
◻️ Use Daycare Pass to get into Daycare.

[Gregory goes upstairs but then Chica notices him.]

Chica: Are you lost? Don't worry. You're safe with me.

[Gregory goes and hides inside a baby crib.]

Chica: Our friendly security staff can help! Your family is looking for you!

[Chica opens the baby crib but then Gregory jumps out and runs.]

Chica: Where are you?

[Gregory runs upstairs and hides in a photo booth, he then checks the cameras.]

Chica: Where are you?

[Gregory sees Chica is gone and he heads to the Superstar Daycare.]

Daycare
[Gregory enters the Daycare.]

Freddy: Gregory, I am unable to reach you. Check the Daycare Security desk for a security badge then let me in.

[Gregory checks his Fazwatch.]

Slide Into Fun.

◻️ Find a Security Desk in the Daycare.

[Gregory sees a slide and slides down into a big ball pit, he then sees a Sun animatronic jump down from a balcony into the ball pit.]

Sun: Hooo hooo hooo!

[Gregory walks towards the ball pit and Sun grabs him.]

Sun: Helloooo! New Friend! You're sure up late! Are we having a slumber party? Where are all your friends?

[Sun grabs him and puts him down.]

Sun: We can finger paint, tell stories, drink Fizzy Faz until our heads ex-PLODE and stay up all night!

[Gregory tries to walk away but Sun grabs him.]

Sun: There is only one rule, keep the lights on. ON. on...

[Gregory pushes down some foam cylinders to distract sun.]

Sun: No, no, no, no! What a mess! Oh, which was the bottom? Where is the tip? Clean up! Clean up!

[Gregory goes towards the Security desk.]

[Sun finishes cleaning up and sees Gregory at the Security desk.]

Sun: New friend, this- this area is off limits. You're gonna get us in trouble.

[Gregory finds Security Badge.]

Sun: Don't you want a puppet show? I have glitter glue! Do you like glitter glue? Google eyes?

[The lights turn off and Sun appears on the desk.]

Sun: No, no! Why would you do that? Lights on! Lights on! I warned you- I WARNED YOU!

[Sun grunts in pain and he falls off the desk and he turns into Moon, he slowly creeps up on the desk.]

Moon: Naughty boy. Naughty boy. It's past your bedtime. You must be punished. Nighty-night.

[Moon jumps in the air and Gregory collects the Security Badge.]

Freddy: Gregory. I do not know what you did, but the lights are put in the Daycare! You need to find the emergency backup generators and turn them on. They are in the play structures.

[Gregory collects a Flashlight, he checks his Fazwatch.]

Let There Be Light.

◻️ Take the flashlight.
◻️ Turn the generator on (0/5)

[He goes into a playstructure and hears Moon.]

Moon: Hidey hide. Hide away *Laughing* Bad children must be found… Bad children must be punished… Knock Knock… 

[Gregory pushes foam cylinders down.]

Moon: Rrrrrgh... Clean up! Clean up!

[Gregory goes and finds the generators, once he's found all 5 all the lights turn on.]

[He goes to click a button near the Security desk and Sun picks him up.]

Sun: Rule-breaker! Rule-breaker! You are banned from the Daycare.

[Sun throws him out.]

Sun: Security alert! Security alert! Wooo! Wooo! *Imitating alarm sound.*

[All the animatronics appear including Freddy.]

Freddy: Gregory jump in! We need to get out of here now! They have found you!

[Gregory runs towards Freddy and jumps into the Cavity Hatch.]

Roxanne: Are you lost?

Monty: Hey, little guy! Give up.

Chica: Gregory!

Roxanne: Nobody will miss you.

Freddy: Go upstairs and do not worry, they cannot find you while we are together.

[Freddy runs.]

Freddy: We are almost out of time. We need to get to a recharge station immediately. Every hour the power is diverted to the recharge stations. When that happens the lights go out and when that happens the Daycare Attending is free to roam the building. It will find you.

[Freddy goes near a fountain and finds a recharge point.]

[As they get in the screen starts to flicker and a woman in a white bunny costume skips across.]

Gregory: What was that?

Freddy: That is a fountain. A fountain is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water.

Gregory: Not the fountain! You didn't see the dancing rabbit lady right in front of us?

Freddy: No I did not. There is no rabbit at the Mega Pizzaplex... Not anymore.

Gregory: This is crazy. It's like the whole place is trying to get me!

Freddy: I am not.

Gregory: Why?

Freddy: I do not know. I want to help you. Maybe they want to help you too.

Gregory: I doubt it. For some reason, you're different.

Upstairs
[Freddy exits the Recharge Station.]

Freddy: Good news. The front doors will open in five hours.

Gregory: Good news? Five hours? I'm not gonna last five minutes!

Freddy: Do not panic. If we get separated again, you can always call me on your Fazwatch - as long as I have power - and I am able to reach you. We should get moving. You can access the main atrium with your new security badge.

[Freddy and Gregory use an elevator and go upstairs.]

Freddy: Gregory I have identified two possible exit points. The main loading dock is located under the food court on the first floor. There is also a fire exit in the third floor Prize Counter. Check your Fazwatch, I will mark both locations on your Faz Map. It appears that you have no Faz Map. You should be able to obtain one from the greeter on the center balcony.

[As Gregory and Freddy go upstairs they walk out and BAM Map Bot comes out of nowhere.]

Map Bot: Hi! Please take this map. Take a map.

[Gregory takes the map.]

Map Bot: Thank you, please enjoy! Free map!

[Gregory and Freddy go to El Chip's, Freddy cannot enter as the door is to small for him so Gregory gets out and enters.]

Freddy: I must warn you, when you enter an area where you do not have a location map signal. I will be unable to reach your location. You can update your mini-map at a security office. Be safe.

Roxanne: Give up. You can't win. I can help. You can't outrun me. Sneak away, little coward. Don't be scared. I bet I'm your favorite?

[Gregory crawls through the vents and he ends up getting chased by a small Music Man doll, he exits El Chips and enters the East Arcade.]

Freddy: Well done, Gregory. You are in the East Arcade. You should be able to get to the Prize Counter through the security office. Look for the door with a security badge symbol on it.

[Gregory tries to enter but the door doesn't open.]

Gregory: Freddy it's no opening.

Freddy: How unfortunate. Head past the Superstat-cade wall, to the back of the arcade. There is a roll up door at the very back which leads to the Prize Counter.

[Gregory sneaks around but he alerts one of the Security Bots.]

Roxanne: Hey kid, come on out. We're only trying to help. Keep searching he can't hide forever!

[Gregory sneaks away but then, Roxanne notices him.]

Roxanne: Are you lost? You can't outrun me!

[Gregory runs away and hides in a baby crib.]

Roxanne: *To herself* You're the best. You will find him first.

[Gregory checks the cameras and sees Roxy has left, he leaves the crib and finds another door that doesn't open.]

Gregory: Locked again? Why does a pizza place need so much security?

Freddy: They are... required safety measures due to past issues. Look for another way in.

[Gregory finds a vent and goes inside it, he finds another small music man doll that chases him, Gregory runs in the vents and makes it to a Security office and gets another Security Badge however it triggers an alarm.]

Intercom: Emergency lockdown activated. This area is off-limits to guests.

Gregory: No, no, no! Freddy! I don't know what happened! All I did was take the badge.

Freddy: Do not panic. That office is now on lockdown. I can deactivate the alarm, but it will take some time.

[Monty and Roxanne appear.]

Roxanne: You are nothing!

Monty: I know you're here!

[Gregory shuts the door on both of them, he continues doing this until the alarm stops.]

Freddy: All done! See? That was not so bad. If the path looks clear, head to the Pizza Counter.

Monty: I will find you. I know you're here. Let's rock!

Roxanne: Don't be scared. Nobody will miss you. You think you're better than me?! I bet you don't even have friends...

[Gregory sneak around and heads to a fire exit.]

Freddy: You found the Fire Escape. Unfortunately. I do not think there is a way to reach it without becoming a VIP it is not a very good emergency system. You are lucky there is not a fire. I have lodged a formal complaint.

Gregory: Freddy, the doors are all locked! I can't get out of here!

Freddy: Get to the elevator. Find a safe path on your Fazwatch.

[The camera zips and Roxanne is near a doorway, Gregory hides in a small cart.]

Roxanne: I'm the best! Keep searching. He can't hide forever.

[Gregory runs and finds the elevator, he enters it but a Map Bot opens the doors.]

Map Bot: Free map. Free map.

Vanessa: Move!

[Vanessa pushes Map Bot away and she grabs Gregory.]

Vanessa: Gotcha!

[Screen fades to black and Gregory wakes up.]

Gregory: Where am I? Look at Al this stuff. Freddy. Freddy, are you there? I'm trapped.

[Vanessa appears on some screens.]

Vanessa: I'll bet you think you're real clever Gregory. Yeah I know your name. You're in big trouble! This is not the night to be wasting my time! So you are going to wait right there in Lost and Found until your parents or the police arrive.

[The screens change to the women in the white bunny suit.] 

???: Are you having fun yet?

[The White Rabbit Lady skips down the stairs to Lost and Found, she waves at Gregory before trying to get in, Gregory finds a vent and escapes before the women gets inside.] 

[Gregory runs into the elevator.]

Freddy: *Glitchy* Gregory... Gregory...

Gregory: Freddy, help! That rabbit lady found me!

Freddy: If you get this message, come to the Roxy Raceway entrance on the second floor. I piled up some boxes so you can hop over the construction fence and find me. Something is jamming my communications signal. Come to the Roxy Raceway...

[Gregory goes to Roxy Raceway but is caught by a Security bot.]

Roxanne: I heard that.

[Gregory runs.]

Roxanne: Sneak away, little coward.

Gregory climbs over the fence and finds Freddy laying down on the ground.]

Gregory: Freddy! Are you ok?

Freddy: *Glitchy* There you are! I was so worried. I waited and waited for you, I missed the hourly recharge and have been trying to get down to Parts and Service. I think something is wrong.

Gregory: Is there anything I can do?

Freddy: *Glitchy* Help me get to Parts and Service.

Gregory: Of course I will! How do we get there?

Freddy: *Glitchy* It is down under the main stage. Normally the stage lift takes me down there after every concert. That is really the only way I know how.

Freddy: *Glitchy* Use that door behind me. It will take you to the rehearsal room on the other side of the building. Look for a Backstage Pass then find a way to turn on the lift.

Freddy: *Glitchy* Good luck superstar. Entering rest mode.

Gregory: Ok, I'll do my best.

 Rehearsal Room 
Gregory: Freddy said I can find a Backstage Pass around here somewhere.

[Gregory goes to the rehearsal room.]

Gregory: There's something else in here. What's this? It looks... old.

[Freddy appears on the screen.]

Freddy: Gregory? What did you do? Something happened. I can communicate again. I think you fixed my signal. Thank you.

Gregory: I can see you on the monitor. I didn't think you could stand up.

Freddy: Consider it a second wind.

[Gregory hears banging from the doors.]

Gregory: Freddy, I see Roxy and Monty on the cameras. They're both coming to the office!

Freddy: Do not let them in. The Security doors are equipped with electronical deterrents. If you see them banging on the door, hit the appropriate button. The shock should stun them.

Gregory: Ok, but how do I get out of here?

Freddy: Do you see the large vent in the floor? You are probably standing right on top of it. If I can reach the room under you, I should be able to force it open and let you out.

Freddy: All the doors appear to be on lockdown. Hmm... Look for me on the monitors. If you see me waving, push the button in front of the corresponding monitor to open the door.

[The Monitor Freddy's face is on glitches and changes to the white rabbit lady.]

???: There you are. See you soon!

Freddy: Hurry Gregory! I cannot stop her!

Freddy: Can you see me?

[Gregory pushes one of the buttons on the right monitor where Freddy is and then pushes the button near the green and red doors to shock Montgomery Gator and Roxanne Wolf...]

Freddy: Over Here!

[Gregory looks around and sees Freddy waving on one of the monitors and pushes the button to let Freddy through a door.]

Freddy:Quickly! Open the door.

[Gregory sees how much time he has and then pushes the button to let Freddy in.]

[Gregory sees Montgomery banging on of the doors and presses a button to shock him.]

Freddy: Can you see me?

[Gregory finds Freddy on another monitor and let’s him through the door.]

[Gregory finds Roxanne banging on the doors and presses a button to shock her.]

Roxanne: Hey kid! Come on out, we’re only trying to help!

Freddy: Can you see me?

[Gregroy pushes a button and lets Freddy into a door again, he then hears something in the vents and the vent is opened.]

Freddy: Jump down!

Gregory: Freddy! You saved me! I'm so sorry. I couldn't find any lift controls. All I found was this... disk thing.

Freddy: Follow me to the atrium. That is a program disk for the stage show. If you use it in the sound booth, you should be able to run a showtime program which will activate the lift.

[Gregory follows Freddy through the tunnel and they end up on the main stage.]

Freddy: *Glitchy* My systems are failing... Go to the sound booth on the 3rd floor balcony... Run the performance program on that disc then meet me back on the stage... Please hurry... You do not have much time... It is almost the end of the hour... I will wait here...

[Gregroy walks towards the stair case.]

Gregory: Why are there so many more security barriers now? I better avoid that spotlight.

Chica: Your family is looking for you.

Gregory: Freddy said the booth is on the third floor.

[Gregory hears the animatronics talking and he sneaks around them.]

Roxanne: Are you hungry?

Monty: You can hide. But you cannot hide! Hey kid, come on out. We're only trying to help. Give up.

Chica: This area is off limits.

Monty: Run, run, run!

Chica: Gregory! Let me take you to your parents.

[Gregory gets to the booth and runs the disc.]

Gregory: That should do it! I hope Freddy’s ok. I should get back to the stage right away!

[Gregory sneaks around the animatronics and meets up with Freddy back on the stage.]

Freddy: *Glitchy* Great job superstar… Just push that button… and the lift will take us down to… Parts and Service…

[As the lift goes down, Moon appears climbing on the walls.]

Gregory: Oh no! What time is it? That moon thing's going to get me! There! On the wall!

Freddy: *Glitchy* Quickly… Get to the re-charge… station!… Follow me.

Moon: It's past your bedtime.

Parts and Service

[Gregory goes inside a re-charge station and hears a loud bang. He looks outside and sees Moon dragging Freddy away.]

[Gregory looks around in Parts and Service and tries open a door, however it needs a level 4 Security Pass]

Gregory: Freddy, can you hear me?

Gregory: Freddy's in there. I have to get him out.

[Gregory walks around and then suddenly Map Bot appears.]

Map Bot: Hi! Please take this map. Take a map. Thank you! Please enjoy.

Gregory: Ugh! I hate that thing!

[Gregory walks around Parts and Service and he stumbles upon an EndoSkeleton.]

Gregory: Freddy, there's something here!

[Gregory walks around the EndoSkeleton before entering a vent.]

[As he walks through another Toy Music Man starts chasing him.]

Gregory: Not again...

[Gregory exits out the vent and goes through a dufflebag]

Gregory: Hmm. It's a map of the utility tunnels. There's a security office nearby. If I can find another Security Badge, I can get into Parts and Service.

[Gregory walks around and he gets close to a mural of an EndoSkeleton giving a balloon to a child, the mural then opens like a door.]

Gregory: That wall just moved!

[Gregory walks around and sees more EndoSkeletons.]

Gregory: So. This is what you look like inside? Creepy. I like you better with your shell on.

[The EndoSkeletons start following Gregory when he turns his back. Gregory enters a security office.]

Gregory: It's the Security office. Hm. Should be one of those badge head things in here,

[Gregory gets the badge?]

Gregory: Got it! I can open Parts and Service now.

[Gregroy looks behind him and sees a horde of EndoSkeletons.]

Gregory: Oh, come on!

[Gregory goes around them slowly and finds Vanessa with Freddy whose stuck in some kind of maintenance machine.]

Vanessa: .... I found him earlier and locked him up in Lost and Found.

Freddy: That is great news. He can be returned to his parents.

Vanessa: He can't. Turns out, there's no record of him.

Freddy: How unfortunate. If you re-attach my head I will go look for him now.

Vanessa: His name is Gregory... You know how I know that? His Fazwatch kept repeating it. In your voice... "Gregory? Are you there? Gregory?"

Freddy: Vanessa, all the Fazwatches sound like me. It is the default voice option.

Vanessa: If you're part of this, you're scrap. Monty will run the shows, until Parts and Service can slap your casing on a new Endo. Hang out here for a while. I gotta find that kid.

Freddy: Vanessa! Do not leave me like this!

[Vanessa leaves the room which allows Gregory to reunite with Freddy.]

Freddy: Gregory! I am so glad you are here and alive!

Gregory: Freddy!

Freddy: Gregory! Use the console to let me out.

Parts And Service: Welcome to Parts and Service. Please select your desired procedure. Please enter the protective cylinder to continue.

[Gregory goes inside and sees Freddy’s head detached from his body].]

Gregory: What'd they do to you?

Freddy: Routine maintenance. I am functioning much more better... now. Grammar function error... Perhaps I am still not at peak performance.

Freddy: Could you reattach my head?

Gregory: I dunno. It looks complicated...

Freddy: Just reconnect the wires and be careful. I am not quite myself at the moment.

Parts And Service: In case of an emergency, the protective cylinder will protect important service personnel outside of the protective cylinder. Deactivating animatronic safety protocols now. It is recommended that no mistakes are made during the procedure. To reconnect Freddy's head, repeat the correct sequence by pressing the flashing buttons on Freddy's upper body.

[Gregory reconnects the wires.]

Parts And Service: Good job. Now, use the testing console to run diagnostics and complete the procedure…

[Gregory uses the testing console.]

Parts And Service: Good job. Freddy is all patched up and ready for the big show. You may now exit the protective cylinder.

Gregory: There's so much tech stuff in here. Is there anything I could use to stop the other bots?

Freddy: Bright lights in the eyes cause us to briefly malfunction. I suppose a Fazerblaster or a Faz Cam could work.

Gregory: Where do I get one?

Freddy: You can win a Fazerblaster in Fazer Blast. Faz Cams are often confiscated in Monty Golf, but you will need a Party Pass to open one of those attractions. Chica normally gives them out for birthdays. Check her green room in Rockstar Row. You may find one there.

Freddy: Use the service elevators at the back of the room. They go up to Rockstar Row. It looks like they are all out of order except for Roxy's.

[Freddy and Gregory go up to Rockstar Row.]

Gregory: Freddy? Check out these pictures. Chica has some sort of special voice box, Roxy has new eyes, and Monty was given better claws. We have to get these! We could upgrade you!

Freddy: Gregory, those parts belong to my friends would never do anything to hurt them.

Gregory: What? All they've done all night is try to hurt me! (under his breath) They get what they deserve.

Freddy: There must be a good explanation. They are not capable of hurting a guest. None of us are. It would go against our programming.

Getting the Party Pass
[Gregory inside of Freddy go near Roxanne’s room and they both hear her crying.]

Roxanne: *Sobbing* I'm not a loser... Don’t be a loser! Get back out there!

[Freddy enters Roxanne’s room]

Roxanne: Who's there? 

Roxanne: Freddy, get out of my room!

Freddy: I'm going. I'm going.

[Freddy and Gregory exit Roxanne’s room]

Vanessa: Come out, come out wherever you are...

Roxanne: Why? Why? It's not your fault. That kid's just lucky.

Vanessa: Are you hungry? Come on out, you little monster. You're in such big trouble, mister. Why you little brat… Stop hiding. I don't have time for this! Come on out.

[Gregory sneaks around and enters Chica’s room and gets a Party Pass.]

Gregory: Freddy! I found the party pass!

Freddy: Well done.

[The lights start to turn off.]

Gregory: Oh crap! It's that horrible moon thing again!

Freddy: Quick, find a recharge station. You should be able to see their locations on the map.

Moon: It's past your bedtime.

Freddy: Gregory, that party pass is very special. It will let you into Fazer Blast or Monty Golf. However, it can only be used once.

Gregory: Great... How do I used it?

Freddy: Just give it to a Party bot. They usually stay in front of the attractions collecting Party Passes. If you have one, it will let you in, I have marked both locations on your map

Split Decisions
Since you can choose Monty Golf or Fazer Blast, you can choose which one you want to read.

Monty Golf
[Gregory decides to go to Monty Golf and finds a Party bot. He then gives them the Party Pass. Gregory then enters the elevator that takes you to Monty Golf.]

Monty: Welcome to Monty’s Gator Golf - home to the Hurricane Hole in One! We’re currently closed for the night. Come back soon!

Freddy: Look for the security office in the back hallway. Since there is no flash photography allowed in Monty Golf. Faz Cams are often confiscated here. Mainly because they are only sold in Monty Golf. It is a very clever marketing plan.

[The elevator stops and Gregroy explores Monty Golf and enters Monty’s Gator Grub.]

Freddy: The security office is near by. You might want to look around the office and see if there is a way to stop Monty from hunting you.

[Gregory finds the office and enters it. Alarms start to blare.]

Freddy: Gregory! They know you are here. Get the security upgrade and get out!

[Gregory grabs the upgrade and he goes through a gift box which gives him a Faz Cam.]

Gregory: What’s this? Looks like an old camera

Freddy: That is a Faz Cam. If you are in trouble, use the camera flash to stun the other animatronics. Keep in mind that it will not work on Monty due to his sunglasses

[Gregory finds another gift box and opens it.]

Freddy: You found the Mazercise Ticket! Now you can enter Mazercise

[Gregory leaves Monty Golf and goes to Mazercise. However he alarms a security bot which alerts Roxanne.]

Roxanne: I’m the best!

[Gregory runs away and hides in a ticket booth.]

Roxanne: You’re the best! You will find him first!

[Roxanne goes away and Gregory manages to enter Mazercise.]

Chica: Welcome to Mazercise! Work off the calories you eat. Sign up for a membership pass today! Super cool perks include discounts on Pizza, Nachos, Fries and cookies! Now, that’s the smell of fitness!

[Gregory goes back stage and finds the maze controls.]

Gregory: These buttons change the maze. I wonder what the right combination is?

[Gregory enters Mazercise.]

Freddy: So. There is a vent in this maze that leads to Monty Golf catwalk. I believe there is a control panel for the maze around here somewhere

[Gregory goes back to the controls.]

Freddy: According to that message. One of the S.T.A.F.F bots brought the key to the Superstar Theater. The entrance is located in the Daycare.

[Gregory goes back to the Daycare and heads towards the Superstar Theater.]

Intercom: Welcome to Freddy Fazbear’s Superstar Theater, now enjoy the comedy stylings of, Staff Bot!

[Gregory goes into the theater and sees a Staff Bot attempting to do Comedy.]

[Gregory finds a gift box and gets the Mazercise Control Key.]

[Gregory gets back to Mazercise and changes the maze to have the vent be accessible. Gregory then enters the maze and finds the vents.]

[Gregory exits the vent and finds his way to the catwalk, he then fires a small turret to turn on a Monty themed Roller Coaster, however an unwanted visitor comes.]

Monty appears holding in to one of the coaster seats, he roars at Gregory before jumping down and destroy a turret, he looks at Gregory and puts his shades down.]

Monty: Rock and roll!

[Gregory runs away and starts using the turrets to fill up a big mechanical bucket.]

Monty: Hey! Little guy!

[Gregory fills up the bucket and a triumphant theme plays, Gregory sees Monty behind him.]

Monty: Hahaha!

[Gregory looks towards the bucket and presses a button.]

[The bucket falls ontop of Monty, Monty tries to lift the bucket, however the floor breaks from beneath him and Monty falls down and hits multiple metal beams which breaks his arms and legs.]

[Gregory walks towards Monty and collects his claws.]

[Gregory exits with Freddy and takes him to Parts and Service to upgrade him.]

Parts And Service: Welcome to Parts and Service. Please select your desired procedure

Parts And Service: Preparing for upgrade procedure. You may now enter the protective cylinder

Parts And Service: Let’s begin by opening the arm casing

[Freddy’s forearm opens up.]

Parts And Service: Disconnect the colored cables to remove the old forearm. It is important that you match the pattern correctly

[Gregory disconnects all the wires.]

Parts And Service: Great. Now place the new armature into the forearm casting

[Gregroy replaces Freddy’s hand with Monty’s claws.]

Parts And Service: With the new armature inserted, reconnect the colored wires

[Gregory reconnects the wires.]

Parts And Service: Great job. Now close the casing

[The casing closes.]

Parts And Service: Good job. Now use the testing console to run diagnostics and complete the procedure

[Gregory runs the diagnostic.]

Parts And Service: Well done. There is no need to perform the procedure for the other arm. The auto-assist did it for you

[Gregory finishes the upgrade.]

Freddy: My arms are different. Where did you get these parts?

Gregory: I’d rather not say

Freddy: How fortunate, I should now be able to smash through the cyclone fences around the building the way Monty does

Gregory: Exactly like he did

[The lights turn off.]

Moon: It’s past your bedtime

[Gregory enters Freddy and goes to a recharge station and all the lights come back.]

Freddy: I’m very glad you made it to the recharge station, Gregory. Now that I have been upgraded I should be able to access Roxy Raceway. I have not been there for a very long time, but perhaps you can find some clues on how to deal with Roxy while you are there.

Fazer Blast
[Gregory decides to go to Fazer Blast and finds a Party bot. He then gives them the Party Pass. Gregory then enters the elevator that takes you to Fazer Blast.]

[Gregory goes inside a Secuirty Office.]

Freddy: Gregory! They know you are here. Get the security upgrade and get out!

[Gregory collects the security upgrade and a opens a gift box and collects an Annual Bonnie Bowl Unlimited Pass

Freddy: What amazing luck. You got an annual Bonnie Bowl unlimited pass. Free bowling for a whole year! Mega Pizzaplex entry not included. Shoe and ball rental fees still apply

[Gregory enters Fazer Blast.]

Staff Bot: You must be the new Fazer Blast recruit and from the looks of you, the orange slash blue team hasn’t got a chance. Soon you will be fighting for your lives on a hostile alien planet. But first, I am here to tell you how to play Fazer Blast. There are 2 rules you must follow at all times, rule number 1, no running, no climbing, no jumping no hitting, kicking, pushing, shoving, no shooting Faz-Blasters in or near close to other players eyes, being flashed in the eyes may induced seizures, blindness, or semi permanent paralysis, if you are flashed in the eyes, immediately flush your eyes with soap or water and blink repeatedly until vision is restored. Rule number 2, have fun. Do you want to hear the rules again?

[Gregory enters the armor room.]

Staff Bot: Before you can enter the arena, you need to grab this helmet and Faz-Blaster

[Gregory enters a hallway.]

Staff Bot: You are on the orange team soldier. Report to the orange hallway

[Gregory enters the arena and the game begins! Gregory captures a flag.]

Intercom: You have captured the flag! Time to defend!

[Gregory gets shot by some Alien Bots while trying to get another flag.]

Alien Bot: Die earth scum

Alien Bot: Stay still so I can shoot you

[However Chica has also entered the game.]

Chica: Employees only!

Alien Bot: Stay still so I can shoot you

[Gregory loses a flag.]

Chica: Who wants candy?

[Gregory gets another flag.]

Intercom: You have captured the flag! Time to defend!

Alien Bot: Resistance is futile

Alien Bot: Capture the flag

Chica: This area is off limits

Alien Bot: Resistance is futile

[Gregory defends the station.]

Intercom: You have successfully defended the station! Move into the next one Space Cadet!

[Gregory runs towards another flag.]

Alien Bot: Resistance is futile

Chica: Our friendly security staff can help!

Alien Bot: We come in peace

[Gregory looks behind himself and sees Chica right behind him.]

Chica: Are you lost?

[Gregory shoots Chica which causes her to stay in one place.]

Chica:: Bawk buck Bawk!?!

[Gregory manages to defend himself from Chica and captures all the flags.]

Intercom: You have defeated the alien army! Good job, Space Cadet! Proceed to the winner’s elevator for your reward

[Gregory goes towards the winners elevator.]

Freddy: Well done, superstar! You won the Fazerblaster! Now go collect your prize from the Superstar Lounge

[Gregory deposits his Faz-Blaster and enters the winners elevator.]

[Gregory gets the Fazerblaster and goes inside a vent.]

Gregory: Where does this vent go?

[Gregory finds his way onto on Fazer Blast catwalk and he finds a room, it looks like someone has been living there. There’s also an arcade machine labeled “Princess Quest 3”]

Gregory: Freddy, that rabbit lady’s in a secret room above Fazer Blast. It looks like a hideout. I think her name is “Vanny”?

Freddy: “Vanny”? It is very similar to Vanessa... and Bunny. That can not be a coincidence

[Gregory exits the catwalk and Fazer Blast entirely and goes to Bonnie Bowl.]

[A security bot triggers an alarm and Gregory sees Chica right behind him, he blasts her with the Fazerblaster.]

Chica: Bawk Buck Bawk?!?

[Gregory quickly enters the elevator.]

[Gregory goes near a stage. It is empty. Freddy speaks.]

Freddy: I do not come up here anymore... I miss him

[Gregory climbs up some boxes and finds a pack of Monty Mystery Mix.]

[Gregory exits Bonnie Bowl.]

[Gregory goes to El Chips and enters the East Arcade.]

Freddy: Well done Gregory. You are in the East Arcade. You should be able to get to the Prize Counter through the security office. Look for the door with the security badge symbol on it.

[Gregory sneaks pass Chica and Roxanne and makes it to the security office.]

Intercom: Emergency lockdown activated. This area is off-limits to guests.

Gregory: No, no, no! Freddy! I don’t know what happened! All I did was take the badge!

Freddy: Do not panic. That office is now on lockdown. I can deactivate the alarm,  it will take some time

[Gregory shuts the doors in the animatronics coming near the office until Freddy deactivates the alarm.]

[The alarm shuts down suddenly.]

Freddy: All done! See? That was not so bad. If the path looks clear, head to the Prize Counter

[Gregory sneaks around and gets into the Pizza Counter. He then turns on the generator for the trash compactor.]

[Gregory puts the Monty Mystery Mix in the trash and he waits for Chica to come.]

Chica: Where are you? I smell pizza!

[Chica goes in the trash compactor and eats the Monty Mystery Mix laced garbage.]

[Gregory tries to start the trash compactor however, a pole gets the hydraulics stuck, Gregory then pushes Chica which makes the pole fall down. Chica is crushed by the trash compactor vertically.]

[Chica lays there motionless, but then she grabs Gregory. Gregory kicks her head away from his body and she’s crushed again, only this time, it’s vertically. She screeches and her eyes pop out.]

[Chica falls down into the garbage heap, however, Gregory is also dragged along.]

[Gregory enters the trash heap, he sees Chica sitting motionlessly and he takes her voice box.]

[Gregory tries to exit the trash heap, however a really angry Chica follows him. On getting out Gregory also has to deal with decommissioned Staff Bots.]

[Gregory on his way enters a room that is filled with sticky notes, one intrigues Gregory. This note is written in binary. It reads.]

“01110111 [[Tel:0 110100 01111001|0 110100 01111001]] [[Tel:00100000 01101001|00100000 01101001]] [[Tel:01110011 001000000|01110011 001000000]] 001101001”

[Gregory finds the exit and leaves, he gets Freddy and enters the workshop. He then upgrades Freddy.]

Parts And Service: Welcome to Parts and Service. Please select your desired procedure

Parts And Service: Preparing for upgrade procedure. You may now enter the protective cylinder

Parts And Service: To access the voice box, we must open Freddy’s chest cavity. To unlock the chest cavity, remove Freddy’s bowtie

[Gregory removes Freddy’s bowtie.]

Parts And Service: Good job. Now remove the chest plate

[Gregory removes the chest plate.]

Parts And Service: Well done. Disconnect the throat wires to continue

Parts And Service: It is important that you match the pattern correctly

[Gregory matches the pattern of the wires and disconnects all of them. He then removes the old voice box and replaces it with Chica’s.]

Parts And Service: Good job. Now connect the throat wires to the replacement voice box

[Gregory reconnects the wires.]

Parts And Service: Well done. Return the chest plate and firmly lock it down with the bowtie

[Gregory places the chest plate back.]

Parts And Service: Looking spiffy! Commence testing phase

[Gregory tests Freddy.]

Parts And Service: Testing phase complete. Activating safety protocols

[Gregory finishes the upgrade.]

Freddy: Gregory. This upgrade, it was Chica’s. Please, be honest. How did you get it?

Gregory: When I was in the kitchen earlier, she fell into some sort of garbage smasher

Freddy: Is she ok?

Gregory: Well... she’s still functional

Freddy: That is a relief. With this new voice box. I should be able to make a vocal pitch that will stun animatronics

[The lights go out. Gregory and Freddy enter a recharge station and the lights come back.]

Freddy: I’m very glad you made it to the recharge station, Gregory. Now that I have been upgraded I should be able to access Roxy Raceway. I have not been there for a very long time, but perhaps you can find some clues on how to deal with Roxy while you are there.

Roxy Raceway
[Gregory goes to Roxy Raceway by entering a place called “Sodaronni” which is connected to Roxy Raceway to bypass the locked gate.]

Roxanne: Hey. I’m Roxanne Wolf, if you’re looking for high speed motor mayhem. Roxy Raceway is the place to be. Sign up today and be a winner! Nobody likes a loser

[Gregory explores Roxy Raceway and finds a race car with a decapitated Staff bot.]

Freddy: I am so sorry, it appears you are not tall enough to ride the karts alone. You will need a working driver assistant bit in order to use this kart

Gregory: Oh man, the robot’s missing it’s head!

[Gregory looks around to find a kart with a working driver assistant bot. He finds a box labeled “Driver Assist” but as he gets close, a bot flies out of the box, Gregory gets startled by this. The bots head then falls off and Gregory collects it.]

Freddy: Good job. You have found a driver assist head. I do not believe it will work in that condition. However, there is a S.T.A.F.F repair station in the West Arcade. You’ll need a dance Pass to access the West Arcade.

Freddy: Have you checked the party garages? The raceway was closed very abruptly prior to the new construction. Guests tried to leave things behind during emergency situations

[Gregory goes to a party garage, he opens a gift box and gets the Dance Pass. He then goes to the West Arcade.]

Freddy: I must stay here, I wish I can join you but after tonight’s stage incident, I am not allowed to perform, when I step onto the west arcade dance floor, I... cannot stop myself, it is a programming bug

Freddy: Head to the security office. You’ll find the S.T.A.F.F Bot repair machine there. If you see the DJ say “Hello” he is such a nice fellow

[Gregory looks around in the Arcade. He finds the DJ, he looks like those small Music Man dolls that chase Gregory in the vent, but he’s much bigger.]

[Gregory finds the security office all the lights shut off.]

Console: The West Arcade was not shut down properly. Some data may be corrupted initializing startup sequence. Before proceeding, reset the audio manager circuit breaker, located next to the dance floor

Freddy: Gregory. The security system knows you are here and has locked you out. Reset the breakers and restore the power to the West Arcade, then you can repair the S.T.A.F.F bot head

[Gregory finds the audio manager circuit breaker and resets it, as he presses the button, the DJ disappears.]

Console: Great job. Safety protocols deactivated. Pram zapped, Brun DJ protocols. Reticulating splines. Please reset circuit breakers to all zones. Three zones remain. Janitorial Service, Arcade, Arcade

[Gregory follows what the console says and resets the janitorial circuit breaker. A loud bang is heard]

Console: Two Zones remain

[Gregory sees the hand of the DJ trying to grab him from the door. Gregory exits through the other door and he runs for his life.]

[Gregory finds the other circuit breaker.]

Console: One Zone remains

[Gregory goes through a hall way full of Arcade games and finds the last circuit breaker.]

Console: We’ll done! The arcade has successfully rebooted. Return to the security office

[As the console says this, the DJ climbs out from a tunnel and chases Gregory. Gregory runs towards the office and he closes the door.]

[Gregory finally deposits the head and it gets fixed. He also gets another security badge]

Freddy: Good job! Take the repaired head back to Roxy Raceway

[Gregory goes back to Roxy Raceway. Roxy is however back and is trying to find Gregory.]

Roxanne: Give up. You can’t win. Don’t be scared! You can’t hide forever! I bet I’m your favorite

[Gregory repairs the kart and he drives on the raceway.]

[Roxanne finds Gregory, she jumps down infront of the kart. Gregory tries to serve out of the way but he falls out of the kart. The kart flies into Roxanne, it smashes her face open.]

[Gregory runs over and collects Roxanne’s eyes. He then finds an exit, but it’s covered by wooden planks. He then presses a button next to it. Roxanne hears the click of the button and she tries to lunge at Gregory but she smashes the door.]

Roxanne: I can hear you! My hair is ruined!

[Gregory goes through a small hole near a wall, but he finds Roxanne on the other side.]

Roxanne: I know you’re here!

[Gregory finds another boarded up door, he tries to get Roxanne to break it again.]

Roxanne: Why are you hiding from me?

[The door opens and Gregory sees fire, he walks slowly, but then Roxanne runs through the fire.]

Roxanne: I’m not a loser! It’s not fair!

[Gregory runs around the fire, while he does that he knocks down some paint buckets to distract Roxanne.]

Roxanne: Where are you?!

[Gregory manages to get inside a vent and escapes Roxanne. He brings Freddy to Parts and Service to upgrade him again.]

Parts And Service: Welcome to Parts and Service. Please select your desired procedure

Parts And Service: Preparing for upgrade procedure. You may now enter the protective cylinder

Parts And Service: Let’s begin by removing Freddy’s face. Press Freddy’s nose to remove skull housing

[Freddy’s face is removed.]

Parts And Service: Carefully detach the ocular connectors

[Gregory carefully removes Freddy’s eyes.]

Parts And Service: Great! Place the replacement eyes into the open eye sockets

[Gregory puts in Roxanne’s eyes into Freddy.]

Parts And Service: Well done. Reattach the ocular connector wires

[Gregory reattaches the wires.]

Parts And Service: It is time to close the face plate

[Freddy’s face is put back on.]

Parts And Service: Commence testing phase

[Gregory tests the eyes. He then complete the upgrade.]

Gregory: How are your new eyes?

Freddy: I am having a hard time adjusting. You look different to me. I can see movement through the walls

Gregory: Really? I didn’t know Roxy could see through walls!

Freddy: These are Roxy’s eyes?!

Gregory: Well yeah. There was an accident in the raceway

Freddy: Is she ok?

Gregory: Well. Nothing seems to stop her

The Final Hour
Freddy: Gregory, good news! It is almost 6 o’clock. You will be safe now if you find an exit. But hurry! The Daycare Attendant is loose one last time!

[All the lights go out and Gregory goes inside Freddy.]

Freddy: These eyes are amazing! There are wondrous colors and objects I never knew existed. Nothing can hide from me now!

[Freddy and Gregory both go up the elevator and Vanessa talks through the intercom.]

Vanessa: Hey little man. Do you know what time it is? The doors are opened. Why are you still here? You plan on moving in or you just want a job? Maybe join the internship program? You would make a great security guard. Gregory, I think you deserve a reward... Go check the main stage

[Freddy and Gregory find the the entrance. Freddy removes Gregory from his stomach hatch.]

Gregory: Freddy! It’s open! Let’s go!

Freddy: No. I can not exit outside of this facility

Gregory: Of course you can! Come on! We can hide you somewhere

Freddy: Without a recharge station, my systems would shut down within an hour. It is a safety precaution. It is my design. This is where I must stay. Do not return, it will never be safe. I will miss you

[Freddy pats Gregory on the head.]

Gregory: Freddy, if I leave now, nothing will change, will it? There will be more disappearances

Freddy: Yes. I am afraid that is correct

Freddy: Gregory, you have a choice to make. The door is open and you can go. Or you can continue to investigate the secrets of the Pizzaplex. I feel there is something else going on besides. Vanny

 Do you wish to stay?

[Gregory comes back to his home... it’s a box in an alleyway. Gregory uses a newspaper detailing the disappearances.]

MISSING

[As Gregory sleeps, Vanny finds him in the alleyway.]

THE END

[Gregory decides to leave...In style!]

[Gregory and Freddy enter a van.]

VROOOOM! VROOOOM!

[The van slams into a Map Bot.]

Map Bot: Hello, please take this map!

[They use the windshield wipers and wipes Map Bot off of the van.]

[Freddy holds onto the handle grip as Gregory drives. They then slam into the Mega Pizzaplex sign.]

[Gregory smiles in glee, the music stops and Gregory’s smile disappears.]

Freddy: Gregory... My Battery...

[Freddy powers down.]

Gregory: FREDDY!

SCRRRCH!

[Gregory stops the van. Gregory hooks up Freddy to the van’s car battery.]

ZAP! KRAAK! ZAAAP!

Vanny: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

Princess: The door is shut.

[She finds a chest with a heart.]

Princess: Oh, how nice!

Leave 

Vanny

[Gregory picks Vanny.]

Gregory: Well, we saw her hideout, right? In Fazer Blast. Maybe we could catch her there. If she thinks I escaped, maybe we can surprise her

Freddy: Yes! Come! Let us end this!

[Freddy and Gregory appear at Fazer Blast, Freddy fights off multiple Security Bots, he looks up and sees Vanny in her hideout.]

[Gregory is chased by all of the animatronics, he hears Vanny.]

Vanny: Are you having fun yet?

[But along side Vanny, Gregory hears Freddy.]

Freddy: Come in Gregory. Can you hear me? I still have a signal. Get to the Fazer Blast booth. Use the security desk. Turn them against VANNY.

[Gregory enters Vanny’s hide out but he plays the arcade game instead of grabbing Vanny’s controller.]
