CEC MISSION ER529
STATUS UPDATE… 
USG KELLION EN ROUTE TO AEGIS SYSTEM… 

PRIMARY MISSION ASSETS… 
…ISAAC CLARKE - ENGINEERING AND SHIP SYSTEMS SPECIALIST… 
…KENDRA DANIELS - COMPUTER SPECIALIST… 
…ZACH HAMMOND - CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER…

…DIRECTIVE A: LOCATE MINING VESSEL USG ISHIMURA…
…DIRECTIVE B: DIAGNOSE AND REPAIR COMMUNICATIONS BLACKOUT… 

TIME TO CONTACT POINT: 3 MINUTES…

Nicole Brennan: (on video) Isaac, it's me. I wish I could talk to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. I wish I could just talk to someone. It's all falling apart here. I can't believe what's happening… It's strange… such a little thing…

[The video goes into static. We find ourselves on board a spaceship, on its bridge. The ship makes a hyperjump. Kendra, Zach and Isaac, the main character, are on the bridge along with a nameless pilot.]

Kendra Daniels: (to Isaac) How many times have you watched that thing? Guess you really miss her. Don't worry, we're almost there. You'll be able to look her up once we're onboard. Sounds like you two have a lot of catching up to do.

Zach Hammond: All right everyone, we're here. Synching our orbit now.

Kendra Daniels: All this trouble of that chunk of rock.

Zach Hammond: Deep space mining is a lucrative business, Ms. Daniels. Aegis 7 is a gold mine, according to prospectors reports. Cobalt, Silicon, Osmium… Now where is she? There she is. We have visual contact.

[They notice a large spaceship in the distance.]

Kendra Daniels: So that's the Ishimura? Impressive.

Zach Hammond: The USG Ishimura. Biggest Planetcracker in her class. And it looks like they already popped the cork.

Kendra Daniels: Why is it all dark? I don't see any running lights.

Zach Hammond: (to the pilot) Corporal, take us in closer and hall them. And stay clear of that debris field. We're here to fix their ship, not the other way around.

Pilot: USG Ishimura, this is the emergency maintenance team of the USG Kellion responding to your distress call. Come in, Ishimura.

Kendra Daniels: You're going to need to boost the signal if the power is low.

Zach Hammond: Yes, we know. Boost the signal. More.

Kendra Daniels: Never heard of a total communications blackout on one of these things. You'd think with a thousand people on board, someone would pick up the phone--

[They hear strange demonic sounds coming from the speakers.]

Pilot: What is that?

Kendra Daniels: It's a busted array like we thought. Sounds like they're having problems with their encoder. You get us down there and Isaac and can fix it. Forty-eight hours max.

Zach Hammond: All right, you hear the lady. Take us in. Let's see what needs fixing.

Pilot: Gravity tethers engaged. Automatic docking procedure is go.

[Unexpectedly, their ship has a breakdown. The equipment begins to spark.]

Zach Hammond: What the hell…?

Pilot: Sir! The autodock--

Zach Hammond: What is it?

Pilot: We're off track! We're going to hit the hull!

Zach Hammond: Hit the blast shields! Their guidance tether is damaged! Switch manual, NOW!

Kendra Daniels: Inside the magnetic field? Are you insane?! About!

Zach Hammond: NO! We can make it inside! Corporal, I gave you an order!

[The ship begins to fall apart.]

Pilot: Argh, the field's too strong!

[The repair ship crashes into the Ishimura.]

New Arrivals
Zach Hammond: Is everyone okay?

Kendra Daniels: What…? What the hell were you thinking? Where are you trying to get us killed?

Zach Hammond: I just saved our asses, Ms. Daniels! If we had aborted at that speed and distance, we would have smashed right into the side of the Ishimura! Now settle down, and let's get to work. Corporal, report!

Pilot: I'm not getting any readings from the port booster and we've lost comms and autopilot. It'll take some time to fix.

Zach Hammond: All right, let's get some extra hands from flight deck to help out.

Kendra Daniels: Hold still, Isaac. I'm syncing up everyone's AIGs with the ship. Okay, we're done. Clean bill of health for everyone.

Zach Hammond: All right. We've still got a job to do. We're moving out.

[Isaac walks out of the crashed ship with everyone.]

Kendra Daniels: You didn't lose power to the port booster. You LOST the port booster. Unbelievable.

Zach Hammond: Guess the power's down everywhere. Isaac, get over here and have the door pad.

[The team proceeds in.]

Kendra Daniels: Seems like everyone was trying to pack in a hurry.

Zach Hammond: There should be a security detail in here.

Kendra Daniels: Yeah, well there's not. There's nobody here. I can't pick up any broadcasts.

Zach Hammond: That security console is still live. Isaac, log in and see what you can find. Kendra, get that elevator back online.

Kendra Daniels: Power's dead. I can't.

Zach Hammond: Then re-route the damn power! Look, if we all cooperate, we can figure this out a lot sooner. Let's get that computer display up, Isaac.

[Isaac goes into the next room and activates the computer with Damage Report on the holographic screen.]

Kendra Daniels: Huh. That doesn't look good. She's taken a lot of damage. 

Zach Hammond: The tram system's offline. Getting around is going to be difficult. The air seems to be flowing again. That’s a start.

[Suddenly the alarm goes on. Serena howls, and the room is flooded with red lights. On the computer screen, the word Quarantine! appears.]

Kendra Daniels: What the hell was that?

Zach Hammond: Automatic quarantine must have tripped when the filtration system restarted. Everybody relax…

[There is a clattering or stomping sound coming from the vent.]

Kendra Daniels: What was that? Did you hear that?

Zach Hammond: I’m not sure… (part of the ceiling collapses) What the hell?!

Kendra Daniels: I don't know! Something’s in the room with us!

[Behind Zach's back appears a creepy, humanoid monster with long limbs instead of arms. He attacks Zach.]

Zach Hammond: Jesus! Open fire! Open fire!

[Isaac watches helplessly through the glass of the next room while his comrades fight for their lives.]

Zach Hammond: Kendra! Power! Kendra…!

Kendra Daniels: Come on… come on. Got it!

Zach Hammond: Isaac, get the hell out of there!

Kendra Daniels: The door's unlocked, run!

[Isaac runs through the corridors of the damaged ship. The monsters follow him, but he tries not to turn around.]

Kendra Daniels: Run, Isaac! Get the hell out of there!

[Isaac barely has time to get on the elevator. One of the monsters tries to pull the elevator doors apart with his sharp hands, but he is flattened. Isaac descends several floors. When he exits the elevator he finds the corpses of the Ishimura crew, a plasma cutter and sees the writing on the wall "Cut off their limbs!" Already in the next room, Isaac encounters a monster attacking a still alive crew member and quickly kills him with the cutter he finds. Soon Isaac finds his first audio log.]

Audio Log (Engineer Benson): This is Benson. Everybody listen up! They’re using the vents! That's how they’re getting around the ship! Stay away from the vents… (someone) Look out! (Benson) Get back! Get back! (death gasps)

[Kendra and Zach contact Isaac on the radio.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac? Isaac! God. I can't believe he made it.

Zach Hammond: Isaac, we ran into more of them on the way over here. Are you okay?

Kendra Daniels: More what?! What the hell are those things? Is that the crew?!

Zach Hammond: Keep your voice down! Whatever they are, they're not friendly. And half the doors and the ship are locked because of the quarantine. Now we have to get to the bridge, but first, we got to repair the tram system.

Kendra Daniels: You're crazy Hammond. You're going to get us all killed.

Zach Hammond: If you listen to me I WILL get you out of here alive. Now what's wrong with the tram?

Kendra Daniels: The data board is fried but there should be a spare in the Maintenance Bay. There's also a broken tram blocking the tunnel that needs to be repaired. Dammit, everything is on the other side of this quarantine. We can't reach it from here.

Zach Hammond: No, we can't… but you can, Isaac. If I can get to the Bridge, I should be able to access the personnel files. You fix the tram and I’ll help you find Nicole.

[Isaac goes in search to find a way to fix the tram. He goes to the Cargo Hallway and on his way encounters a dead monster. He kills it by blowing off its limbs and head.]

Audio Log (Engineer Benson): This is Benson. tram engineering. We think we've figured it out. Smith killed one! Listen, forget about shooting them in the body, you gotta cut off the limbs. Grab a cutter, anything like that. Cut them apart!

[Isaac enters the Tram Tunnel. Zach contacts him.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac, be careful. Shooting them in the body didn't seem to work. Go for the limbs, dismember them. That should do the job.

[Isaac goes on and finds a stasis module next to a faulty door that quickly opens and closes.]

Kendra Daniels: Looks like that door is malfunctioning, Isaac. Try using the Stasis Module you just picked up.

[Isaac slows the door down and enters Tram Station Hall. After destroying a nest of monsters, he removes the damaged tram from the pipe.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac, you did it! That tram was blocking the whole system. When you get the computer online, you'll be able to call the tram from the control room. Faster the better… I can hear something crawling around out there…

Audio Log (Engineer Benson): Listen up, car B is trashed. We managed to get it back to the repair depot, but now the auto-loader is fried. I need a Stasis module brought down here now! If we don't get this piece of shit off the tracks, it's going to jam up the whole system!

[Isaac runs to the Maintenance Bay, destroying the monsters that have appeared in the corridors. Kendra calls him.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac. I patched into the deck’s security system. It took some work, but I've got the door to the Maintenance Bay unlocked. The data board should be somewhere inside.

[Isaac enters the cargo elevator and goes down to Maintenance Bay.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac. It’s Kendra. It looks like the door to the storage room is locked. There should be a key somewhere in the maintenance bay.

[Isaac fights his way through the bay and finds the key. After that he goes downstairs and finds the data board.]

Kendra Daniels: That's it, Isaac! Take that board back to Tram Control and siot it into the computer array. That should get the tram system back online.

[Isaac returns to the Tram Control and inserts the data board, and then starts the system.]

Zach Hammond: Alright, we're on board and heading to the Bridge. Good work.

Kendra Daniels: Strange… the quarantine just lifted…

Zach Hammond: Whatever was in the flight lounge must have left. That's lucky for us. Isaac, get back to the Kellion and prep it for launch. We find out what we can from the bridge and meet you there.

Kendra Daniels: If we live that long. You're out of your league, Hammond. This is suicide! We're going to die out here.

Zach Hammond: Your lack of confidence in me duly noted, Ms. Daniels, but I have a mission to complete and that's exactly what I am going to do. With or without you. Do we understand each other?

Kendra Daniels: Just get us out of here alive.

[Issac approaches the Flight lounge.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac, we made it to the Bridge. It's a nightmare up here. No survivors. We're going to try and get to the Command computer. Wish us luck.

[Isaac climbs aboard the repairs ship and tries to send a damage report. The monsters climb onto the ship and do a final damage job on it. The ship catches fire. Isaac barely manages to jump out of it before it explodes. Now he has to fight a horde of hungry monsters.]

Zach Hammond: What the hell is happening down there?! What happened to the shuttle?

Kendra Daniels: That was our ride home… It's the only way off this ship…

Zach Hammond: Kendra…

Kendra Daniels: No Hammond! This changes everything!

Zach Hammond: Just let me think! Can you access the Command computer?

Kendra Daniels: It's no good. There’s an executive lockdown of all primary systems. Without the Captain's authorization, I can't access them.

Zach Hammond: Well? Where's the Captain?

Kendra Daniels: Here he is. Captain Benjamin Mathius. Location… Medlab. Status… Deceased.

Zach Hammond: What? How?

Kendra Daniels: I can’t access that information. Find the Captain and you'll find his RIG. With his authorization codes, I can crack this computer wide open.

Zach Hammond: Dammit! Isaac, I'm sending the tram back to your location. Get to the Medical Deck and find that RIG as fast as you can.

Kendra Daniels: (hearing some noise) What was that?

[A monster breaks in.]

Zach Hammond: Holy shit! Come on, get out of here!

[Isaac walks to the station and visits a vending machine where he buys an upgrade for his armor and a plasma rifle. He boards the tram. Chapter 1 completed.]

Intensive Care
[Isaac arrives on the platform of the medical deck. He sees a woman sitting next to a mutilated corpse. She is in shock. Her voice is full of tears and despair. She is blinded - her eyes are covered with bandages.]

Ishimura Crew Member: Shhh… shhh… It's alright, McCoy… He’s here… Nothing to be afraid of… I knew you would come… just like you said… I… I… saved this for you… Can I go now? McCoy wants to take me… to the shuttle…

[She throws the Kinesis module on the floor and dies. Isaac uses the new module to clear the blockage in the corridor and moves on.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac? Are you there? We were attacked. Kendra's gone! One minute she was there, then… I can't believe I lost her. We can still do this. Get me the Captain's RIG codes and we'll find Nicole. Looks like the crew barricaded the door to the emergency wing. You'll have to blow through it to get to the morgue. Get some thermite from Medical Storage, and a shock pad from Zero-G Therapy. Should be down the corridor.

[Isaac goes to the Main Laboratory. Quarantine mode is activated and he has to fight for his life. He finds an audio log in one of the offices.]

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: What in god's name is going on down there?

Captain Benjamin Mathius: I think that's precisely the point, doctor. God's work.

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: I'm not so sure of that. We have to assume that the colony's problems are somehow connected to the Marker.

Captain Benjamin Mathius: You can assume all you want to. I do not. The Maker is glorious and divine, you - you know that.

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: God moves in mysterious ways…

Captain Benjamin Mathius: Anyway, we'll have it on board tomorrow. You can analyze it all you want to. What are you so worried about?

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: Worried? Captain, people are dying down there. Killing each other. Is this madness the "transformation" Unitology teaches us?

Captain Benjamin Mathius: Doctor… Terrence… there will always be risk when the stakes are high. And here, they're enormous. It could change everything.

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: That's what worries me.

[Isaac finds another audio log in a restroom.]

Audio Log (Doctor Challus Mercer): I finally convinced Jurgens to show me the video feed from the colony. And what I saw was glorious. Breathtaking. Miners undergoing a transformation into something extraordinary. I must know more. Even as the believer within me wants to become one of them, the scientist needs to uncover their secrets. I need to study one of these… necromorphs, as Kyne so clinically puts it. I need to witness this infection.

[Isaac walks into the next room and sees one of Ishimura's crew running away from a new type of necromorph behind the glass.]

Ishimura Crew Member: C’mon! C’mon! Let me out! Nooooo…

[A little dinosaur with tentacles pierces the poor guy. Soon, Isaac is given the opportunity to fight the creepy creature himself. It jumps at him trying to strangle, but Isaac throws it off him and crushes its head with a heavy boot. Isaac picks up a thermite round.]

Zach Hammond: Alright, that thermite you picked up should be able to melt through the barricade. Use the shack pad to ignite it. Hope I can hold this position. I can hear something big moving out there.

[Isaac goes to the Imaging Diagnostic Wing. In the corridor, he sees one of Ishimura's crew members slowly and methodically smashing his head against the wall until he dies. Isaac solves several dimensional puzzles, plays with gravity, and eventually finds the Shock Pad.]

Zach Hammond: Great, you got a shock pad. Combine that with the thermite at the barricade to destroy it. Shit. I can hear more coming. Moving through the vents. Stay safe, Isaac.

Doctor Challus Mercer: You found something down there, didn’t you?

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: Yes… we found something.

Doctor Challus Mercer: So the texts were right. All this time.

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: I wouldn't be certain of that. There was nothing divine in what I saw.

Doctor Challus Mercer: We must embrace this! We are the First Witnesses!

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: Mathius isn’t letting anyone down on the colony. It's under quarantine until we learn more.

Doctor Challus Mercer: To hell with Mathius! He, of all people, should know that this is greater than him, or the operation, or even the company. This is our deliverance!

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: Keep your damn voice down! People are dying down there.

Doctor Challus Mercer: Only the worthiness and the unbelievers. But I believe. Do you believe, Terrence? Do you?

[Isaac uses the found items to blow up the barricade blocking access to the Clinic.]

Zach Hammond: Okay, you're through. Should be clear from there to the morgue. Remember, the codes are on the captain's body.

[Isaac finds another log… with his girlfriend, Nicole on it.]

Video Log (Senior Medical Officer Nicole Brennan): This is Senior Medical Officer Nicole Brennan, transmitting ship wide. We need more help! We don't have the resources to deal with this many cases. Nobody will tell us what's happening. These wounds… we're not equipped to deal with this… (screams in the background) God. Get him to the table! Hold him! Nurse, you hold him down! Christ! End recording!

Zach Hammond: That was Nicole, right? I can't tell from here when that log was made.. I'm sure she's around here somewhere.

[Isaac explores the blood-soaked medical wing. Only the necromorphs are in it.]

Audio Log (Eileen Fisk): Hello? Can anybody hear me? My name is Eileen Fisk. I just woke up in here and everybody was gone… I don't know what's happening… Why did they all leave? I'm going to try and find someone… If you can hear this, please come for me… I can hear scratching in the walls… H-Hello? Who's there? Are you a doctor? Why has everyone… wait. I know you. You're Harris! The prisoner from the colony! You killed that nurse… Help! Somebody help me! Please!

Audio Log (Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne): Science log. Chief Science Officer Dr. Kyne reporting. The colony's problems concern me greatly. I have no doubt they are somehow linked to discovery of the marker, but the exact nature of that connection is still unknown. Almost 40 percent of the colonists are experiencing a form of dementia. The obvious symptoms are acute depression, insomnia and hallucination. Incidence of violence and even murder also indicate extreme paranoia. Dr. Mercer has advised that I bring some of the affected on board for study. Dr. Welland, the planetside psychiatrist, has reported that his aun analysis has been fruitless. I'm hesitant to rely on Dr. Mercer at this point, but I need his expertise. We need solutions and we need them quickly.

[Isaac finds Captain’s RIG.]

Zach Hammond: Codes received, and they look good. Thank god. I’ll start accessing the Captain's records right now. Head to the tram station, and contact you there. I'm going to find out what the hell happened to this ship…

[Isaac runs to the station fighting cunning and nasty necromorphs.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac! Somehow one of them found a way down to the Captain's Nest! I managed to contain it in a damaged escape pod. Lifting the executive lockdown now… I found the deck logs… Whatever is happening around here, it came from the planet when they cracked it open. It spread to the colony, and reached the ship. Isaac, this isn't an infection. It's some form of alien life! Shit! We've got bigger problems. The ship's engines are offline and our orbit is decaying! Get over to the Engineering deck asap, while I stay here and figure out what the problem is.

[Isaac runs to the station and boards the train. Chapter complete.]

Course Correction
[Isaac arrives at the Engineering Deck.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac, we've got two problems, and we're working on borrowed time here! First, there's no fuel in the engines. Second, the gravity centrifuge is offline… which means there's a couple of trillion tons of rock pulling us down. I need you to get that centrifuge operational. Refuel the main engine and fire it up so I can stabilize the ship's orbit.

[Isaac finds an audio log in the control room.]

Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple): Personal log, acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple. It's been two days since they pulled that planet open… since the captain died. The panic, the riots… they were nothing compared with what came after. Our friends, our co-workers, started coming back… Changed… coming back to kill us, drag us away. Rucker disappeared this morning, and I have to assume he's dead. My crew… they're starting to crack. I'm trying to keep an eye on them, but right now I have bigger problems - we're hemorrhaging fuel and the primary engine is laboring. Danvers and I are going to try to reach the fuel depot to see if we can fix it. Temple out.

[Isaac finds another log.]

Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple: (hearing screams) What in hell is going on here? Danvers!

Danvers: It's… it's Henderson. He's crazy! Pulling his own… teeth out!

Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple: Henderson! For god's sake!

Henderson: Unh…

Danvers: Oh, god. Is he dead?

Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple: Relax, he's alive. But he hit that door pretty hard.

Danvers: Man… Why would he do something like that? I don't get it.

[Isaac uses kinesis to activate various broken mechanisms and move around the deck. Along the way he encounters a small delegation of necromorphs, but quickly bids them farewell. Isaac finds another log.]

Danvers: Never should have let him live. Never should have let him live.

Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple: Shut it, Danvers! Shut… it! Engineering log. Temple reporting. Someone has shut off the fuel lines to the primary engine and damaged the valves in the process. They need to be repaired before I can re-open them, but we're running out of time. With the engine offline, orbit decay will begin in less than ten hours. I just can't understand who would do this. If it's one of those crazy Unitologist bastards, I’ll break their neck.

Danvers: Henderson said they were coming. We never should have let him live.

Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple: (angrily) Shut up Danvers and help me with the tools. Temple out.

[Isaac activates the refueling sequence.]

Whatever you did, it's working Isaac! I have a fuel reading. It's only a quarter full, but that's enough to restore orbit once you bring the engines online… What the hell? False alarm. Thought I saw something.

[Isaac enters the Centrifuge Room. He finds an audio log in one of the lockers.]

Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple: This is Temple. Now the centrifuge is offline! We've got four trillion tons of rock hanging off our ass, and without that centrifuge to balance the ship, the gravity tethers will puil us straight down to the colony! I’m heading in there now to see if I can fix it.

[Issac goes to the decontamination room and activates it.]

Computer: Decontamination sequence activated. Please stand by.

[The room is flooded with twirling red lights. The windows are covered with iron bars. A stream of white smoke pours from the ceiling. Necromorphs start bursting into the room. The lights suddenly go out… and Isaac has to fight for his life.]

Computer: Decontamination complete. Thank you for your patience.

[Isaac goes further and enters a room with the centrifuge. He tries to start it up. The artificial gravity does not work in this room.]

Computer: Centrifuge power offline. Please attach generator modules manually, then return to this station.

[Isaac does so.]

Computer: Generator module attached. Generator module attached. Centrifuge power restored. Centrifuge activated. Re-establishing balance with planetary cargo. Gravity restarted. Entering vacuum.

Zach Hammond: You're doing great, Isaac! Centrifuge and gyros are both a hundred percent and stabilized. Now get out of there and focus on the engine. I don't know how much time we have left.

[Isaac collects all the useful items and leaves the room with the centrifuge. When he emerges into the corridor he is attacked by a huge tentacle with a claw on the end. It tries to drag Isaac away, but he shoots a nerve knot and the tentacle lets him go. He enters the elevator and gets a call from Kendra via video link. She's very nervous.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac! Can you hear me? It's Kendra… They attacked me… I ran for it… and Hammand iust… he just disappeared.

Zach Hammond: Kendra! Where are you?

Kendra Daniels: Nice to see you're alive and well, Hammond. I’ve barricaded myself in the computer core. I can hear them moving outside. But I don't think they know I'm in here-- I can log into everything from here. I hacked the root, and found some reports from the colony. Even before they cracked the planet, the colonists were experiencing widespread dementia. It seems to be related to some artifact they found on the planet. Something called “the Marker.” I’ll keep looking. I've got your location, and I'm going to unlock the door to Fuel Storage. You can get to the engine chamber from there.

[To get to the right meth, Isaac has to go into open space. The other part of the ship turns out to be overgrown with some alien abomination.]

Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple): This is Temple. Screw the engine. I can't restart it by myself, and with all the other shit going on, it's obvious this is sabotage. I'm heading for the bridge. and then I need to find Elizabeth. I've got to get her off this ship. It's not safe.

[Isaac gets to the engine bay.]

Computer: Ignition sequence initiated. Please stand by.

[Isaac has to fight off a horde of necromorphs who want to feast on his guts.]

Computer: Engines firing.

[Steam is pouring out of the pipes. The engine spews out a burst of flame, hot as the depths of hell.]

Zach Hammond: It's working! We're online and functional! Finally some good news. Get a tram to the bridge. Isaac, I'm going to take us back into a geostationary orbit.

Kendra Daniels: Wait, wait! We're not safe yet. The ship's asteroid defense system is offline. On the way up, the ship's going to pass through a debris field thrown up from the planetcrack… We’ll be ripped to pieces unless you restart it.

Zach Hammond: Goddammit. I’ll start working on it from here. Isaac, meet me at the Bridge. You can do more good here than I can.

[Unexpectedly, Isaac gets a call from someone else. The voice is distorted by static.]

Nicole Brennan?: Isaac… Isaac… Where are you… It's me… Nicole…

[Isaac returns to the station and boards the train. Chapter complete.]

Obliteration Imminent
[Issac arrives at the Bridge Deck.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac, come in. Kendra's right, the ADS is completely shot. I'll need your help to fix this. Kendra, if you can hear me, see if you can get into the ship reports. It sounds like you have better access from there.

Kendra Daniels: When were you going to tell us about the artifact, Hammond? This ‘Marker?’

Zach Hammond: I don't know anything about that. It's referenced in the captain's records. They brought it up from the planet…

Kendra Daniels: It’s on the ship?!

Zach Hammond: In cargo. They think it's alien origin. But I don't know what the hell it is.

Kendra Daniels: Really? CEC didn't know anything about it? You’re lying.

Zach Hammond: Back off. I am not the bad guy here. We're all shaky right now. You're going to have to trust that I don't know anything about it. (static) We’ve entered the debris field! Get to the captain's nest. I'll explain everything later. Hammond out.

[Isaac enters the Main Atrium. An asteroid crashes into the ship, right near Isaac.]

Computer: Warning! Hull breach detected.

Kendra Daniels: Isaac! Impact on the bridge, right at your feet! I'm reading heavy damage, but containment looks solid. Life support is stabilized. We've got to get the ADS working.

Audio Log (Unknown Crew Member): Bridge, come in! We’ve been boarded! Repeat, the ship has been boarded! We are under attack! What the hell are they? They, they've already killed most of the Deck staff! We need security backup here immediately! Guns are useless, we can't hold them back for very long…

[Isaac goes down to Captain's Nest and finds Hammond there.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac! Damn, you scared me. This place is making me jumpy. Fucking asteroids coming through the roof… Look. I know Kendra doesn't trust me, but I don't know anything about a Marker or anything else. This was supposed to be a repair mission, plain and simple. This mess is the Asteroid Defense System. I can fix these boards, but the main power routing is shot. You're going to have to re-route them manually through at least three junction boxes to activate the primary cannon. Oh, but first you need to activate the Atrium elevators from Bridge Security. You can use them to get to the junction boxes. By the way, Isaac. Be careful. I saw something out there, I don’t know what. I only got a glimpse, but it was big. Really big.

[Issac leaves Hammond and approaches the elevators and sees a necromorph in one of them.]

Zach Hammond: Shit! Stand back! (flushes the pod) Thought that one was dead when I sealed the pod. These things don't die easily.

[Isaac goes upstairs and encounters a large and beefy necromorph.]

Zach Hammond: Your weapons can't punch through that thing's armor! Shoot it in the back, Isaac!

[Isaac kills the vile creature. In the passageway that the boar broke through, the monitors turn on for a second, showing Nicole's face.]

Nicole Brennan?: Isaac… Make us whole again…

[Isaac picks up a video log in the elevator.]

Captain Benjamin Mathius: This is mutiny! You'll all be tried for mutiny! Kyne, make them listen to reason!

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: Settle down, Ben. Hold him! By maritime law article 5459 I hereby declare Captain Benjamin Mathius unfit for duty.

Captain Benjamin Mathius: The Marker must be delivered to the church! Terrance, please…

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: I’m sorry, Ben, but I can't let you do this.

Captain Benjamin Mathius: Traitor! Heretic!

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: Hold his head!

Captain Benjamin Mathius: Murderer!

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: Hold him!

Captain Benjamin Mathius: (Kyne injects something) Aaarrrggghhh!

Ishimura Crew Member 1: He's… he's dead…

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: No! It was an accident! I had to stop him…

Ishimura Crew Member 2: Arrest the Doctor!

[Isaac continues.]

Kendra Daniels: It looks like some of the gravity platforms is malfunctioning. Keep an eye out for any kind of distortion effect coming from the floor. It could be dangerous.

[Issac cleverly uses the ship's damage to kill necromorphs and save ammo. He soon manages to repair the junction boxes.]

Zach Hammond: Ship Systems junction box re-routed. I’m making some progress with the tracking grid… one of the cannons is giving me a hard time… keep moving.

[Issac returns to the bridge, kills some of the creatures that have appeared there, and quickly runs into the elevator.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac, listen up. I've gone over the med-sci reports. These things are BIO-RECOMBINATORS. They take dead tissue, absorb it and molds it into new forms. One iteration seems to have the sole purpose of infecting corpses. The others, well, seem to be making corpses to infect. And that body tissue we keep seeing on the walls is part of it, too. I found a report that says it's a habitat changer.

[After walking through space and a series of dangers, Isaac manages to reallocate the energy.]

Computer: Power transferred to the ADS.

Zach Hammond: Control Systems junction box re-routed. I'm getting a reading! Almost there.

[When Isaac exits the elevator he sees a mutating member of the Ishimura crew in the distance.]

Ishimura Crew Member: Make us whole again.

[Before Isaac can do anything, the mutant escapes.]

Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple): This is Temple. The bridge is fucked. I don't know what went on in there. but I'm not sticking around in case whatever did it comes back. I'm heading for Hydroponics. to find Elizabeth.

Computer: Asteroid Defense System now online.

Zach Hammond: All right, we've got enough power. But the ADS cannon's auto targeting is down. I think it's a faulty data cable. I need you to aim the cannon manually until I can replace it. Take the elevator to the top of the ship, and head for the cannon pit.

[Isaac heads towards the cannon.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac, you're going to have to cross the ship exterior to reach the ADS cannon. Problem is, we're still getting bombarded by asteroids. Look for cover or you'll get torn to pieces.

Computer: Warning. Multiple impacts detected across the starboard hull.

[Isaac runs along the hull of the ship. Only the magnetic boots keep him from flying into outer space. He barely has enough oxygen for such a long run. After that, he sits in the pit of a huge laser gun.]

Computer: Manual override initiated.

Zach Hammond: That's it, Isaac, you're in the pit. The cannon's a massdriver, so it should punch through anything flying at us. Keep an eye on the hull's integrity. Too many of those things get by and we're dead. I think I’ve almost got the system repaired. Just buy me a little more time!

[Isaac shoots the asteroids.]

Zach Hammond: I've almost got this thing fixed! Just a little bit longer!

[Isaac has some more fun.]

Computer: Automated tracking system enabled.

Zach Hammond: Nice shooting, Isaac! Auto targeting is now online and cleaning a path to safe orbit! As soon as we're clear, I engage the autopilot again. Head to the tram station and I meet you there when I'm done.

[Isaac runs to the station.]

Kendra Daniels: Wait! Isaac, Hammond… you're not gonna believe this. Oxygen levels are falling. Something's poisoning Hydroponics air production, and whatever it is, it's filing the deck up with that organic stuff. We're not going to have any air to breathe soon. But if I understand these lab reports correctly, I think I can make a poison to destroy it. Head to Medical. It should have everything you need.

Zach Hammond: Will this never end?! Isaac, get to Medical and mix together whatever Kendra's come up with. I'm heading to Hydroponics. If I can slow it down, that might keep us breathing long enough to fight it.

[Before getting on the train, Isaac goes to the store and improves his armor. The chapter is complete.]

Lethal Devotion
[Isaac returns to the Medical Deck.]

Kendra Daniels: Shit, Isaac! I can smell the contaminated air from here. It's spreading faster than I expected! I'm trying to isolate it but it's not going to buy us much time! We have to get that thing off this ship! The chemicals you need are in the Chemistry Lab. I’ll hack the door for you when you get there.

[Isaac enters the Security Station. Someone is standing behind the smoked glass of the security booth. An eerie voice comes from somewhere.]

Creepy Voice (Doctor Challus Mercer?): You can't stand in the way of God's plan… The natural order… Are you… Are you blind, like the rest?

Kendra Daniels: Looks like someone has reprogrammed the door locks on this deck. And recently, too. I guess we're not alone here. after all. Someone doesn't want you in this part of the ship.

[Isaac begins to explore the deck.]

Kendra Daniels: You're close to the chemistry station. Once you get the chemicals, you're also going to need a DNA sample of the alien tissue. I’ll search the records for one.

Audio Log (Doctor Challus Mercer): Personal log. Dr. Challus Mercer. I now have a live subject for my study. I'm eager to validate my tissue regeneration theory. Initial restraint was problematic. but now the patient is resting comfortably. HE trusts me. Doctor Kyne. He puts his life in MY hands! He knows his part in all of this, understands what I’m doing! The forehead has been swabbed clean and marked…

Patient: What are you... what are you doing with that?

Doctor Challus Mercer (sounds of a saw) …and I am now attempting to create a passage to insert the sample tissue into…

Patient: No! No! Nooaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!

[Isaac finds a machine that can create antigens.]

Computer: Processing request. Please stand by Antigen compound completed. Please remove the capsule.

[As soon as the procedure is completed, the glass guard on Isaac's right is raised. Behind it, we see Dr. Mercer alive and well.]

Doctor Challus Mercer: What ARE you doing? Your fight for survival is admirable but pointless. And yet you keep on going. It almost makes me think that we had hope, as a species. Am I the only one who sees that we have died out a long time ago? We just haven't accepted it yet. Stop running. Stop your struggle. Our future, your future, the future of our race, ends here. Allow me to introduce you to humanity's child. The children that will replace us. Our greatest creation.

[Dr. Mercer leaves. A new type of necromorph bursts out of the tank behind Isaac's back - it's similar to the usual ones, only much stronger. Space in the room is limited so Isaac uses stasis on the monster and fires a whole clip of his plasma rifle straight into his chest.]

Kendra Daniels: You can't kill it, Isaac! it's just going to keep regenerating! Get out of there, run!

[While the monster regenerates, Isaac escapes.]

Zach Hammond: (through static) Is anyone there? Repeat! Come in Isaac... Kendra. Is anyone there?

Kendra Daniels: Hammond! Where the hell have you been?

Zach Hammond: I've reached Hydroponics. It's bad down here, really bad! ...can barely breathe! That organic matter is growing everywhere! My eyes are stinging... must be seeing things…

Kendra Daniels: (to Isaac) Now you need to find a DNA sample of the growth. According to lab records, there's an inert sample stored in the ICU. A Dr. Mercer was apparently doing intensive research on it. I've been trying to contact Hammond but all I'm getting is static! Isaac, you've got to hurry!

[Isaac meets Dr. Mercer again. He is standing behind the glass again.]

Doctor Challus Mercer: Your persistence surprises me. Holding on to your final breath, you claw your way alongi You hold onto what was once your world. But now, it belongs to the children. Be glad of the knowledge that your death… will bring their birth! Listen! Can you hear it? it is coming. Say your prayers.

[Dr. Mercer leaves. In the next room, Isaac encounters the regenerating necromorph but now he comes with his buddies. Isaac pulls out a flamethrower.]

Kendra Daniels: Someone keeps shutting down the door protocol. I've bypassed the lock! Go!

[Isaac walks through the blood-soaked corridors of the medical deck. On his way he encounters a demented crewwoman laughing at the corpse lying in the corner.]

Audio Log (Doctor Challus Mercer): Personal log. Doctor Challus Mercer. The specimen continues to respond well to my experiments. Its cellular fortitude, not to mention elasticity, is remarkable. Doctor Kyne, I am sure, would disapprove. But do not anticipate that issue. as the good doctor is busying himself with the Marker... As if that matters now! He has also succumbed to the same dementia that affected the colony. Only yesterday, he told me he had spoken to his wife... but Amelia Kyne has been dead for some years. (creepy growl) My subject grows restless. Patience. Your time is soon. Very soon.

[Isaac finds a batch mixer.]

Computer: Adding sample 9797 to chemical compound. Final mixing required.

[Kendra calls Isaac over the video link.]

Kendra Daniels: That's it, Isaac! Now you just need to finish mixing the poison.

[The call interrupts.]

Doctor Challus Mercer: This has gone far enough! Accept your part in god's plan! Embrace your own extinction!

Computer: Warning. Life support system failure on Medical deck. Please evacuate immediately.

Kendra Daniels: Who the hell was that?! Isaac, he's decompressed the entire deck and I'm being locked out of those systems! All the air has been vented into space! You should be able to bring it back online from the Security Station, but you don't have much time!

[Now Isaac needs to beat the clock to save his life. He manages to survive.]

Kendra Daniels: I've got more intel on the atmosphere. A survivor's report says that a massive creature entered the Hydroponics deck from outside the ship. That's when the air quality began degrading. The survivor called it… the Leviathan.

[Isaac finds the final Batch Mixer.]

Computer: Processing request. Please stand by. Final mixing completed. Please remove the capsule.

Kendra Daniels: Let's hope that poison works! Head back to the tram station, and get up to Hydroponics as fast as you can. Still no response from Hammond so be careful! There's no telling how contaminated that deck is.

Doctor Challus Mercer: I’m beginning to truly admire your spirit, misplaced as it may be! I think... I think you should see... The whole plan. You should not spurn the Hive Mind's offerings. You deserve to witness that, at least.

[Isaac proceeds to the next room.]

Doctor Challus Mercer: (via loudspeaker) Perhaps now you will understand. The work I have done must continue… will continue! I, Dr. Chailus Mercer, shall serve as the catalyst to the salvation of our species! These specimens will return to Earth with me. I will spread their divine glory across the entire planet! I’11 leave you with my creation. Embrace the inevitable.

[The regenerating necromorph and his buddies attack Isaac again. Isaac decides to use the cryo-chamber - drives the monster there and presses the button on the panel.]

Computer: Freezing cycle activated. Freezing cycle successful. Transporting patient.

Kendra Daniels: Let's just hope that's the last we see of that… thing. I’ve managed to override Mercer's lockdown. There's a secondary tram station nearby and you can take to Hydroponics. Let's just hope there's enough time.

[Isaac goes to the station and takes the train. Chapter complete.]

Environmental Hazard
[Isaac arrives at the Hydroponics Deck and finds an audio log on the platform.]

Audio Log (Doctor Elizabeth Cross): Hydroponics Log. Dr. Elizabeth Cross reporting. I'm pleased to say that we're working close to maximum capacity at the present time. All flora is healthy and thriving and food yield has created a surplus. I was going to pass the surplus on to the colony, but the Captain has given a no-fly order. I want to note my opposition to that order. Everyone knows they're in trouble down there, and I don't see what denying them our surplus will achieve.

[Isaac activates the irrigation system, bringing tomatoes to life in the terrarium.]

Computer: Watering cycle initiated.

[In the next corridor Isaac finds Zach lying on the floor. He points his machine gun at Isaac, but when he realizes he has a friend in front of him, he puts the gun down. He is clearly in bad shape.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac.. Good to see you in one piece... Don't take... your helmet off... The air’s rotten... I got a look.. at it.. It's huge... you won't believe it.. shut itself in Food Storage.. The crew that was on this deck... I think they're what's poisoning the air. They've been transformed... I saw one of them, bloated, swollen. They're poison factories… we need to take them out while we can still breathe... 

Kendra Daniels: (via video link) Hammond! I thought you were dead! You need to get to cleaner air! You're not going to be able to help Isaac in your condition. Isaac, I’m scanning the area now. He's right, there's something really big in Food Storage, but I can't get a good scan. Monitor readings are off the scale. Be careful!

[Isaac begins to look for the Food Storage.]

Kendra Daniels: That's the door to Food Storage. But I can't override the integrity lockdown. You have to destroy the pods to bring the air quality up. Then you can go through and use the poison on the Leviathan. I suppose I should be glad that Hammond's alive, but I still don’t trust him. I think he's hiding something about the Marker.

[Isaac gains access to a greenhouse infested with necromorphs. After leaving the greenhouse he enters the zero gravity zone.]

Computer: Warning. Air filtration system is still active. Entering the filtration tubes is extremely hazardous.

[Isaac goes through dangerous pipes and gets into an elevator, which takes him down several levels.]

Audio Log (Doctor Elizabeth Cross): Hello? Hello! Security! Thank god. This is Dr. Cross, in Hydroponics. I'm trying to locate Second Engineer Jacob Temple! I can't get through to Engineering! Of course I know there's a ship-wide medical alert! That's why I'm trying to locate him! No, we're safe for now. But the tram is down, and we can't reach the escape pods. Hello? Hello?!

[Issac walks through a wide rocky walkway whose walls and floors are smeared with the stinking sludge of necromorphs.]

Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple): This is Temple, Acting Chief Engineer. I came down here to find Dr Elizabeth Cross, but she's not here. In fact I can't find anyone. Just more of this organic shit everywhere. I'm going to check the Mining deck. It's about the only place I haven't locked yet.

[Taking advantage of zero gravity, Isaac moves freely down the corridor and kills the necromorphs stuck to the walls that produced the poison gas.]

Kendra Daniels: That's the last one, Isaac. There’s a switch in Atmosphere Control to restart the oxygen recycling. Once the air's clean, you can get into Food Storage. Isaac, I've been reading these reports… the crew all began having mass hallucinations. And… well... just saw my brother on a security monitor. And that's just not possible…

[Isaac runs to the Atmosphere Control killing necromorphs with fire.]

Nicole Brennan?: (through static) Isaac… Where are you? Help me…

[Isaac turns the air purifiers on.]

Computer: Flushing all air vents. Restoring nitrogen and oxygen levels. Food Storage lockdown lifted.

Audio Log (Doctor Elizabeth Cross): (nervous) Hydroponics log. This is Dr. Cross. It... It's hard for me to believe what I'm seeing here. This is crazy, absolutely crazy. I'm going to the Mining deck. I hear that's where survivors are gathering. Jacob… I'll wait for you there.

[Isaac inserts the antigen in the purifiers.]

Computer: Unknown antigen injected into the filtration system.

[The roots blocking the door die.]

Kendra Daniels: Dammit the poison wasn't strong enough. It's still alive! Get in there and kill it, before it contaminates the entire ship!

[Issac goes into the next room. There he sees a horrible monster, nestled at the far end of the room. Gravity shuts down. Isaac runs up the round walls and shoots, dodging spits and tentacles. After a few minutes of intense fighting, the monster dies.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac, you did it! Hammond? Do you read? Oxygen levels are returning to normal. Dammit! He's gone again! No sign of his RIG anywhere! It's up to us now. I've got a plan to get off this ship! I’ve located an SOS beacon on the Mining Deck. If you can get down there and activate it, we might be able to send a distress call.

[Issac picks up the ammunition left on the deck, checks his harness, and boards the train. Chapter complete.]

Into the Void
[Issac arrives at the Mining Deck station.]

Kendra Daniels: This may be our last chance of getting out of here alive, Isaac. There's an asteroid loaded up in the mining bay, waiting to be smelted. If you attach the SOS beacon to it, you can launch it away from the ship to make a clean broadcast. The beacon's on the Maintenance sub deck. You can launch the asteroid from the control room. Damn, the control room is locked. It looks like they keep an emergency access key on the Processing sub deck. Couldn't be easy, could it? I don’t know how much more of this I can take.

[Isaac explores the deck and finds a dying security guard. Isaac arrives too late.]

Kendra Daniels: The mining sub deck is offline for some reason, Isaac. I'll see if I can run a bypass.

Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple): This is Temple. I found Elizabeth, but there isn't a single spaceworthy vessel in the whole goddamn bay!

Doctor Elizabeth Cross: Jacob, hurry up! We need to find a beacon!

Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple: There's got to be one around here somewhere.

[Isaac enters a strange room with a massive energy beam rushing through a thick tube in the room’s center.]

Kendra Daniels: There's a failsafe on the processing control door. It won’t open until gravity is restored. But you can't turn on the gravity until those boulders are cleared from the room. Maybe you can dump them into that gravity beam with your Kinesis gun.

Computer: Anomaly destroyed. All free-floating anomalies destroyed. Gravity can now be restored. Gravity restored. Access permitted to control room.

[Isaac finds the key on a mutilated body.]

Kendra Daniels: That's the key, Isaac. It'll get you into the Control Room so you can launch the asteroid. Don't forget to attach the beacon first! I read another report on the colonist's dementia. It seemed to start after they removed the Marker from the planet. God knows how long it was down there.

Computer: (in a room full of bodies) Please recycle any unused materials regularly. Thank you.

[Issac takes the elevator down to the abomination-stained corridors.]

Audio Log (Crew Member): Dr. Kyne! What the hell are you... Aaah!

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: Get back! Come any closer and... and I'll shoot him! Give me the access codes to the cargo bay!

Crew Member: You... idiot! This is… processing! Why the hell... would I have codes… to cargo?

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: Don't lie to me! I'm sick of everyone lying to me! It is imperative that I get the marker! Give me those codes!

Crew Member: I don't... have them! Is this... what you did… to the captain? Go and... shoot me if you’ve got... the balls!

Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne: IDIOTS! It’s the only way to stop it... The only way to end this!

Crew Member: He's completely lost it... Somebody call security!

[Issac enters the technical corridor and pulls up a cradle. He gets in the cradle and moves along the corridor. Suddenly, to Isaac's left, from around the corner, comes... Nicole.]

Nicole Brennan?: Isaac! Is that really you? It feels like it's been so long... But I can help you, now. Come with me.

[She runs away. Isaac follows her into another room.]

Nicole Brennan?: The Beacon's in the storage room next to you. I think I can disable the lock from here. Hold on!

[She starts typing something into the panel next to her. At that moment some necromorphs trying to attack her. Isaac ruthlessly kills them.]

Nicole Brennan?: Okay, the door's unlocked, Isaac. I can't get over to you… but I'll find a way. I love you... this will all be over soon...

[She leaves.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac! Hey, I lost your signal for a while. You had me worried... I see you've got the beacon, so head for the mining bay and attach it to the asteroid. I've been running trajectory calculations and if we launch soon, there's a good chance the asteroid can reach a safe distance to begin transmitting. Still no sign of Hammond. In his state, I can imagine he's still alive…

[Isaac sees some suits covered with necromophs abomination.]

Computer: Safety gear must be worn at all times in Class A environments.

Kendra Daniels: I've got elevator access to the mining sub deck. It was a security lockdown, although I don't think it helped them. Now that you've got the beacon and the key, head over there. It looks like the asteroid is held in place by some gravity tethers. You'll have to knock those out before you can launch it.

Audio Log (Supervisor 2nd Engineer Dallas): Processing log. Supervisor 2nd Engineer Dallas reporting. This will be my last report. I've seen what they do to the bodies. What they become. I can't let that happen to me. At least I don't have any limbs… I won't be able to kill anyone when I'm infected… Please, tell Dawn... and the kids... that I love them. (gunshot) On God… (another gunshot) One more… one more... (gunshot)

[Isaac buys himself a new and improved armor. He enters a huge hangar in which a kinetic beam holds a giant-sized asteroid.]

Computer: Warning. Payload 8772 is no longer tethered. Untrained personnel Should leave the area immediately!

[Isaac begins his arduous journey to manually undock the asteroid. In addition to technical moments, he has to fight hordes of necromorphs.]

Computer: Dinner will be served in the Mess Hall in ten minutes.

[He finally manages to detach the asteroid.]

Computer: Payload 8772 launched.

Kendra Daniels: Beacon's on It's way. All functions normal, and broadcasting wide band. Now we just have to hope Somebody's listening. I'll position the array receiver. I thought I saw my brother again. He waved to me. Like nothing was wrong. Okay, I should be able to leave this channel open... What? The Comms Array receiver isn't responding! Isaac, can you get back to the bridge? We need that array online or we can't receive signals from anyone responding to the beacon!

[Issac returns to the station and boards the train. Chapter completed.]

Search and Rescue
[Isaac arrives at the Bridge Deck.]

Kendra Daniels: Things are looking up! A military ship lust shocked in the USM Valor... I don't know what it was doing out there, but it must have gotten our distress signal. We can't talk to it until that Comms Array is fixed. I'm going to hack the door to Communications for you. Get in there and find the Comms Control Station.

[Issac goes to the bridge where an ambush of exploding necromorphs awaits him. After defeating them all he gets into the elevator.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac, the door to Communications is open. But I've been getting some weird feedback spikes on the local comms. I think someone's listening in on us so be careful.

[Issac blows his way through the corridors of Ishimura with a flamethrower.]

Audio Log (First Comms Operator Bailey): Communications log. First Comms Operator Bailey reporting. The ship is under attack, but requests to issue a distress call have been repeatedly denied by Captain Mathius. He won't say it, but everyone on the bridge knows why--this is an illegal operation in a prohibited system. We've all known for months, and we kept our mouths shut. Not any more. Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is USG Ishimura, this is--what the hell? I don't believe this! The whole comms system is offline! Now he's gone too far... Balley out.

[Issac finds a wide circular room with communicators on the bottom. They glow red.]

Computer: Communications array online. A service technician has been notified.

Kendra Daniels: That Comms Array is in bad shape. We need at least six working dishes for a strong enough signal. Make sure they're aligned symmetrically so there are no power gaps.

Computer: Communications arrays are aligned. Messages can now be received.

Kendra Daniels: That's it. It’s working! Get back to Communications and use the control panel to send our coordinates to the Valor!

[Issac sends a signal to Valor.]

Valor Crew Member: This IS USM Valor, widecasting on all frequencies to USG Ishimura in response to your SOS. We've picked up your escape pod number 47 and are en route to your position. This message will repeat every thirty seconds until you respond.

Kendra Daniels: What? Isn't that the escape pod Hammond jettisoned? One of those things was onboard! No! No, this isn't going to happen! USM Valor! Come in Valor! Our signal isn't strong enough. I'm going to open the blast doors to boost the signal.

Computer: Error: blast door blockage detected. Please contact a repair technician.

Kendra Daniels: Shit! Isaac, there’s something big on the hull of the ship directly above the Comms Array. Something organic. I don't know what it is, and I don't care. We have to get the doors open to transmit to the Valor. You should have a clear shot from ADS cannon 4B. Get to the cannon and blew it out into space!

[Issac runs to the cannons and sits at cannon 4B.]

Computer: Manual override initiated.

[When the safety flaps are raised... Isaac sees a huge bug-like necromorph crawling around the Ishimura. Isaac destroys it.]

Computer: Opening Communications Array blast doors.

Kendra Daniels: USM Valor, this is Kendra Daniels on the USG Ishimura, come in! Do not open the escape pod. USM Valor, this is Kendra Daniels on the USG Ishimura, come in! Do not open the escape pod! Dammit, respond!

[Video feed from Valor appears on the screen for a second. It shows how a necromorph brutally kills one of the crew.]

Valor Crew Member: Ka... What…

Kendra Daniels: (in tears) Why did they open the pod?! Dammit... 

[USM Valor slowly approaches Ishimura.]

Kendra Daniels: Oh my god, It's heading right for us! Isaac! ISAAC! Get the fuck out of there! It's going to crash into the ship.

[But… there’s no time. Valor crashes into Ishimura. Isaac falls on the floor and the screen fades to white. While he's lying on the floor, Nicole calls him via video link.]

Nicole Brennan?: I wish I could just talk to someone. It's all falling apart here. (the picture changes to coughing Zach) Isaac! Isaac, are you there? Thank god you're all right! I've been trying to reach you! Someone's been blocking my RIG signal remotely! That crash must have interrupted the signal block.

Kendra Daniels: Hammond? Where have you been? 

Zach Hammond: Surviving. Barely. I found some med supplies and patched myself up. Listen. I'm calling abort on the mission. Fuck the CEC and fuck the chain of command. We have to get the hell out of here! I think I've located a shuttle on the crew deck. The flight log says it needs a new singularity core, but we can probably salvage one from the Valor. I can see the tail-end of it sticking out from the side of the Ishimura. I'm headed down there now to find a way inside! I'll meet you there! Hammond out.

Kendra Daniels: Isaac. If what he says is true about the shuttle, we might have a chance of getting out of here. Head to the cargo bay and see if you can help Hammond... in his condition, he may not last long. 

[Isaac returns to the station and boards the train. Chapter completed.]

Dead on Arrival
[Isaac arrives at Cargo Bay.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac? Good. You made it inside! Listen, I just found the munitions log for the Valor! I don't think their presence here is a coincidence. They're not on reconnaissance and they're not on patrol! This ship is prepped for war! They're on a seek and destroy mission. Do you hear me?! (static)

Kendra Daniels: Isaac, I've lost him again! No signal from Hammond's RIG... Find the singularity core and get the hell out of there!

[Isaac begins to explore Cargo Bay and discovers bright green glowing orbs in the air.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac, one of the Valor's weapons dipped open in the crash. Those green orbs you see are highly radioactive, and the Valor's airlock has sealed itself. You're going to have to throw those into space before you can get into the ship.

[Isaac destroys the fuses and thus opens the airlock. Gravity is sucked out of the bay along with the corpses. The green orbs begin to slowly descend into the open airlock. Some of them have to be manually dragged to it with stasis. Isaac has to work very fast because his oxygen supply is severely limited.]

Computer: Radioactive material removed. Radiation hazard clear. Safety lock released. 

[Isaac leaves the cargo bay and enters the USM Valor.]

Kendra Daniels: The part you're looking for will be in the engine room at the back of the ship! I'm reading massive damage, so you may need to find an alternate route to get there.

[The corridors through which Isaac has to move are badly damaged. There are many mutilated corpses all around, and the walls are stained with blood. Here and there, pipes burst or something breaks. Isaac is away from someone, he escapes quickly.]

Zach Hammond: The infection process is doing something strange to these soldiers. They all had built-in Stasis units in their body armor. The infection is merging the Suits unit into their flesh or something... making them move fast… real fast. Be careful.

[Soon Isaac is faced with the aforementioned necromorphs. Their shaking movements, caused by stasis, cause involuntary trembling. They attack very quickly, which makes them extremely dangerous, but Isaac still manages to deal with them. He continues to advance through the crumbling corridors. At one point, the monitors briefly turn on and we see Nicole's face.]

Nicole Brennan?: Isaac... Make us whole again…

[Isaac keeps going and soon he gets a call from Zach.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac. I'm tracking your position but it doesn't look like I can reach you. This damn ship was nearly sheared in half. I made it to the bridge… It's a mess here. These poor bastards didn't stand a chance. I'm going to override all door locks so you can get to the engine room. I'll try and catch up with you there. 

[When Isaac enters the elevator he receives a very unexpected call. He is contacted via video link by Dr. Terrance Kyne in the flesh.]

Terrance Kyne: Mr. Clarke! I need to speak with you... My name is Terrance Kyne... Doctor Kyne. Listen to me, there isn't much time... If you really can repair the shuttle... there is a better use for it than just running away. You must understand, the forces at work here are... greater than you can imagine. If you leave now… you condemn all humanity! The planet will never stop, never rest, unless the Marker is returned. Don't you see? The Church is wrong! This is all a trap! I've seen it... Please, you must help me!

[Isaac continues to examine the USM Valor and finds the audio log.]

Audiolog (Commander Cadigan): This is Commander Cadigan! We have hostiles on board. This is NOT a drill! Hostiles are alien, repeat, ALIEN and extremely dangerous! All personnel have weapons ready and fire at will. 

[Isaac continues to explore the USM Valor, but every corridor is difficult for him. There are a lot of necromorphs around, and the ship itself is not in the best condition. Nevertheless, he manages to get the core.]

Computer: Engine power failure.

Kendra Daniels: Is that it? You got it? Oh my god, you got it! That's the piece we need. Get to the Crew deck! 

[Isaac follows her advice and meets... alive Zach along the way. He is holding a machine gun. He has clearly survived more than one fight.]

Zach Hammond: Isaac! Over here! I've been trying to reach you but my comm was out! You got the singularity core... That's our ticket out of here. Get that core to the shuttle! Don't wait for me. Oh, fuck me. Aaarrgh!

[A huge necromorph appears. Zach fearlessly rushes out to attack. However... the necromorph crushes him in a split second and turns the corpse into a bloody mess. Isaac runs away, but the necromorph catches up with him. Isaac has to engage in combat. By some miracle, he kills the monster.]

Computer: Lockdown lifted. 

Kendra Daniels: I just lost all of Hammond's vitals! Is he dead? Oh god. It's just us now, Isaac...

Computer: Warning. Catastrophic failure of fuel containment. Evacuate the vessel immediately.

[Isaac escapes from the crumbling ship. Upon reaching Ishimura's cargo bay, he sees the Valor explode with a rumble as deafening as possible in space. Isaac boards the train and heads for Crew Deck.]

End of Days
Kendra Daniels: Isaac, I've located the shuttle Hammond found. Shit! No good. That shuttle's brain dead. Someone removed the navigation cards, God knows why. There's three of them scattered around the deck. I'm downloading their locations. I can't access the doors from here, so you'll need a Crew Key. If you can find those parts, I think we can get that shuttle operational again! 

[After some wandering through the corridors, Isaac finds a door from behind which a familiar voice is heard. The door itself turns out to be closed.]

Terrance Kyne: Amelia? No… No no NO NO! The shuttle is mine. I control access to the shuttle! If it could make the journey... I could fix everything... I'm sorry, Mr. Clarke. Unless you can prove to me you can get space worthy again. I'm afraid I can't let you through. I need to know you're on my side!

[Some time later Isaac finds other survivors. Behind the thick glass he sees Challus Mercer and Jacob Temple tied to a chair.]

Challus Mercer: What do you cling to when all must seem so utterly hopeless around you? Or Cross was a true believer. She wants her transformation. Her rebirth. Are you ready to ascend, Mr. Temple? Of course you are. Have no fear. You will play your part soon enough. wliness the conviction of a true believer! They are ready! Take them! Embrace them!

[He stabs him in the forehead with a dagger. Temple dies in agony, and Mercer walks away. Isaac continues his gruesome adventure. He receives a video call from Dr. Kyne.]

Terrence Kyne: Mr. Clarke! I really... must speak with you! I'm very close to your position, and... and I know you'll want to hear what I have to say. I can explain all this. I know what happened! When you have the Nav cards, I'll let you into the Security Station. We must talk. Hurry.

[Isaac overcomes countless dangers as he explores the monster-infested ship. In addition to his misfortunes, the life support system is disabled. In one of the cabins, Isaac finds a working holographic display. On it, we see a video recorded by Mercer himself.]

Challus Mercer: (on video) How can you be turning away from the Church in this vital hour? Do not abandon your faith! What's happening on the colony is not a tragedy. It is God's work! The truth is even more fantastic! On the planet below us, we have found a Marker! Can't you see, God's plan is unfolding, and we are its inheritors! We will ascend, as we always knew we would! UNITOLOGY IS TRUTH! And your death is the first phase of this transformation. Do not be deterred by the physical methods of transformation. Soon, you will be beyond any physical concerns! You must have faith in the process. Where are you going? You fools! This is what we ve been searching for all these years! This is what we have been waiting for. Don't listen to them! Come back! COME BACK!!!

[Soon this nice man calls Isaac personally.]

Challus Mercer: This time there will be no escape for you, my friend. You have been most resourceful up until now, but my creation is free, reborn in the fierce heat of life itself! Now it's time to play your part…

[At that moment, a large necromorph jumps down on Isaac from somewhere above. It comes at him aggressively. A long and grueling battle ensues, as the monster has an enormous reserve of health. Isaac has no choice but to take advantage of his surroundings. He tactically retreats by closing the massive doors behind him.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac, that son of a bitch lust overrode the door lock. I'll try to run a bypass. Hold on. Okay. I bypassed the lock! Get out of there!

[Without wasting a minute, Isaac runs away.]

Terrence Kyne: Excellent work. Mr. Clarke! Excellent work. Now... come and meet me in the Executive area. The door is unlocked. Be quick.

Kendra Kyne: Isaac, be careful with Dr. Kyne. A lot of what I've discovered so far has come from his records... the man has clearly gone insane. He might be unstable, maybe even violent.

[Isaac returns to the good doctor. He paces back and forth across the room, muttering to himself.]

Terrence Kyne: Amelia. I knew that you would know what to do. I knew, I love you so... You made it! Thank god, you made it... I've been following your progress. I know you want to repair the Executive shuttle and leave this place, but... Escape is impossible at this point. The... the shuttle's shockpoint drive is destroyed. No no no no no no no, don't lose hope! Don't lose hope. At first I lost hope. I tried to scuttle the ship, sabotage the systems... but Amelia... she changed things. The church! They think the Marker is divine, but they don't know what's happened here! What's been released! Look, look, look... Look at this.

[He shows Isaac a short video of a giant monster the size of a building.]

Terrence Kyne: That is what we found in the core of the planet... Mercer calls it the Hive Mind. It's the source… controlling the necromorphs telepathically! We were so STUPID! But Amelia, she knew. She knew it could be stopped... by returning the Marker to the planet! The Marker was containing it within the planet. Return the Marker, and seal the Hive Mind! Please. I'm sorry Amelia... I bear much of the responsibility for this tragedy. Now, I must take responsibility for ending it, and atone for my sins. But you can help me. If you repair the shuttle, and bring the Marker back on board... We can end this. Forever.

Audiolog (Captain Benjamin Mathius): Captain's log, personal. I want to set the record straight. By the time this log is heard, my actions will have been vindicated. I'm a Unitologist. By now, it's probably no secret that we shouldn't be in this star system. Just another illegal mining job for the company... That is until the colony found the Marker. That was when the Church took an interest, and chose me to lead this pilgrimage. They also ensured many of the mission crew were devout. My primary instruction was to get the Marker up from the colony and on board the ship. Dr. Kyne, the CSO. is an expert on the original Marker and was tasked with deciphering this new one. He Says he's making good progress. My decision to quarantine the colony is sound. They've got some kind of epidemic down there, and I can't allow it to infect the ship. Not with such a precious cargo. Not when we are so close! Planetcrack takes place tomorrow. We'll continue to decipher the Marker, and when we return home, we'll pass all our findings, and the Marker to the Church. The government isn't going to cover this one up. Altman be praised.

[Isaac finds the shuttle and gets a call from Dr. Kyne.]

Terrence Kyne: Excellent! Excellent! Wait there for me. I'm on my way.

[Before launching the shuttle it is necessary to check all systems. Isaac starts the check but suddenly necromorphs appear.]

Computer: Testing shuttle engines. Test firing shuttle engines.

[While the system is checking itself, Isaac has to fight for his life, but afterwards he manages to cheerfully burn the necromorphs with the shuttle engines.]

Terrence Kyne: It works? Yes, this will work! There's still time to make things right. The shuttle needs to be released before launch... The Control Platform, there'll need you to guide the undecking procedure while start the shuttle's engines. This will make us whole again. Hurry! I'll take the shuttle up to the Flight Deck where the Marker is being held. I'm en route to the Flight Deck. Meet me there, and we can load the Marker on board. Yes, Amelia. Soon we'll take it home... 

Kendra Daniels: I don't know if Kyne is crazy or not, but we need that shuttle. Let's keep him on our side... for now.

[When Isaac enters the elevator, Mercer calls him.]

Challus Mercer: Your time has come. No need to be frightened! No reason to fight! Many have gone before us, and now it's time for us to take the voyage together, transcend death... and let the future take its course. Join me, as gaze upon the face of God!

[The next thing that happens in the video is incomprehensible. A necromorph approaches Mercer and apparently kills him. The good man does not resist the cruel death. Isaac boards the train heading for the cargo bay.]

Alternate Solutions
Terrence Kyne: Mr. Clarke. I'm approaching the shuttle hangar. You must... You must find your way to the Cargo Bay! The Marker... It's being stored in there. There's a cargo loading if there you can use to deliver the Marker up to the hangar. Please... you must help me with this! it's the only way... 

Computer: Delivering cargo shipment 782. Kinesis module required for further cargo transport. Delivering cargo shipment 782 to the Hangar Bay.

Terrence Kyne: The cargo lift has arrived! The Marker is in the hangar bay. Now you can load it into the shuttle. Hurry!

Kendra Daniels: I restored power to the elevator. Take it up to the Hangar Bay and get that Marker on the shuttle. I'm heading up to the flight deck now. Oh god. I'm just going to run for it… wish me luck.

Terrence Kyne: Excellent! I'm going to dock the shuttie. Got to be careful now… careful…

[The giant cargo bay gates open. A powerful rail crane hauls the shuttle into the bay.]

Terrence Kyne: I'm bringing the shuttle down now. The automated loading controls aren't responding. You'll have to shut down gravity in the hangar bay and then manually bring the Marker directly beneath the shuttle.

[Isaac carries out the errands given to him.]

Terrence Kyne: Okay. It's in position. Eh, still having trouble with these damn loading controls. Isaac, restart gravity to the room. I should be able to load the Marker then.

[Isaac does what he is told without a word.]

Computer: Loading cargo shipment 782. 

Terrance Kyne: It's on board! Please, come and join me. Together we can stop this Hive Mind, we can end this nightmare! At last!

[Finally Isaac goes to the crank of her meeting with Dr. Kyne in person, without thick glasses or videolinks.]

Terrence Kyne: Over here! Hurry, there's no time to waste, we must do it... 

[Suddenly something pierces the good doctor's chest like in Alien.]

Terrence Kyne: Wait... Amelia... where are you going... wait. (dies)

[The shuttle leaves.]

Kendra Daniels: Sorry Isaac. I couldn't let him go through with it. I suppose I should thank him for finding the Marker. We even managed without help from the USM Valor... Thank you for helping me find it, by the way. My departments been looking for this place for a long time. See, what Kyne didn't know was, it was the government's mess to begin with. This whole planet is one big experiment. The Marker? This divine relic? (chuckles) Made by man. They reverse-engineered it a couple of hundred years ago from the REAL Marker, a true alien artifact recovered on Earth. They dug it up, studied it, and made it their own. Then they brought it to Regis 7, and activated it. And you've seen the result. The stuff of nightmares. They sealed the system, and no one would have been the wiser. But then CEC blunders in and starts tearing the planet apart. The experiment was still alive. Kyne was right about the Hive Mind. The Marker would contain it… but that doesn't matter now does it? I have the Marker and this entire system can go to hell. For what it's worth, you did a great job, Isaac. See you around... Or maybe not.

[Suddenly the connection with Kendra is cut off and Nicole appears on the screen.]

Nicole Brennan?: Isaac! It's Nicole! I need you to help me, help us. Now! I'm... I'm in the night control room! Please, Isaac hurry! Please... I love you…

[Isaac runs to the control room.]

Nicole Brennan?: Isaac! Is that really you? I never thought we'd be together again! God, I'm - I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry for what I did... I never wanted to hurt you. You need to get it back now. Isaac. You can pilot the shuttle remotely from here! Make us whole again!! Make us whole again... 

[Isaac intercepts control of the shuttle from the control room.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac, what the hell are you doing? You're making a big mistake. This is not over!

Computer: Escape pod away. Crew shuttle USM-09. Repeat, shuttle has ejected escape pod.

Nicole Brennan?: It doesn't matter. She can't escape her fate... None of us can. Here it comes. I'll reprogram the shuttle so we can fly down to the colony. We're so close, Isaac. Now go! 
Get on shuttle! I'll meet you there! 

[They board the shuttle.]

Nicole Brennan?: You're doing the right thing, Isaac. We're together now, the way it always should have been. I knew you would come back for me. Nothing can stop us now…

Dead Space
[The shuttle arrives on the planet's surface.]

Nicole Brennan?: Isaac! Use one of the leaders to get the Marker off the shuttle!

Isaac, the Marker needs to be returned to the Pedestal Chamber. Use the loader to bring it there and place it on the pedestal. Replace what was taken, and make us whole again.

Audiolog (Sergeant Abraham Howard Neumann): This is Sergeant Neumann, P-Sec! We've lost all the shuttles! One of them just took off, then came straight back down and crashed into the bay! Took a couple hundred people and all the remaining shuttles with it! If anyone can hear this, do not land! Do not land!

[Isaac practically drags the huge Marker across the colonists' base by hand.]

Nicole Brennan?: Isaac, you're almost there. You'll have to restore power to the bridges to move the Marker through this area. Look for a control station at the end of the maintenance tube.

[Isaac takes the Marker out into the open air and sets it on a pedestal.]

Nicole Brennan?: Thank you, Isaac. I always believed in you. I know you would return to me. We are whole again, Isaac. We are whole.

[The Marker begins to emit an unthinkable amount of energy into the atmosphere.]

Computer: Emergency: geo-orbital gravity tethers offline. Tectonic load released. Impact imminent. Evacuate this area immediately.

[He leaves the open space and re-enters the colonists' base. There he is met by Kendra. She has a gun in her hand.]

Kendra Daniels: Isaac. Isaac... You really didn't think I was going to just walk away, did you? I can't do that. The Marker's Coming with me. It's a shame... I was starting to like you. Even if you are insane. What you don't believe me? Take a look at yourself. Better yet, take a look at that video from Nicole. And this time, watch it right to the end…

[While Isaac watches the video, Kendra slowly drags Marker away.]

Nicole Brennan: Isaac, it's me. I wish I could talk to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything I wish I could just... talk to someone. It's all falling apart here. I can't believe what's happening... It's strange... such a little thing... In the end, it all comes down to this one little thing... I didn't want it to end like this. I really wanted to see you again. Just once. I loved you. I always loved you.

[She injects herself with something and dies.]

Kendra Daniels: See? You're insane. Just like Kyne, just like the Captain. Nicole has been dead this whole time. Whatever you were seeing… was caused by that. You're its pawn. But don't worry. It will be in good hands, now. Far away from this damned place. Goodbye, Isaac.

[Isaac comes to the surface and notices Kendra walking away. Suddenly two huge tentacles appear.]

Kendra Daniels: Oh my God!

[One of the tentacles crushes Kendra. Isaac has to fight the monster the size of a building. He shoots at the eye-like spurs and manages to win. He quickly leaves the colonists' base, and sees from space as a huge meteorite crashes into the planet. Isaac wearily removes his helmet, showing us his face for the first time in the entire game, and decides again--for the last time--to watch the video with Nicole.]

Nicole Brennan: Isaac. It's me. I wish I could talk to you. I'm sorry about everything. I wish I could just... talk to someone. It's all falling apart here. I can't believe what's happening... It's strange... such a little thing... 

[He sighs. When he hears a rustling sound, he turns around. At that moment, Nicole's ghost jumps out of the darkness with a terrifying, heartbreaking scream. The video ends abruptly.]

THE END
