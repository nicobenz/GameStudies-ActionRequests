Shun Akiyama
Akiyama manages a company called Sky Finance, located in a building off of Tenkaichi Street. Commonly known as the "Lifeline of Kamurocho," Sky Finance is famous for loaning money to those who have been turned down by other loan sharks. Rumor has it prospective clients must take a special test as part of the "loan terms" before they can receive a loan.

Taiga Saejima
A former junior leader of the Tojo Clan's Sasai Family and the perpetrator of the "Yoshiharu Ueno Hit" of April 1985 - an incident in which 18 members of the Ueno Seiwa yakuza clan were killed in Tokyo. Saejima received the death penalty a few months after the incident. As of 2010, he has spent 25 years in the Tokyo Penitentiary awaiting his execution day.

Masayoshi Tanimura
A detective in the Community Safety Division of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Tanimura is known as the "Parasite of Kamurocho." He frequents Kamurocho's many red-light establishments to receive bribes in exchange for turning a blind eye towards their illegal activities. However, Tanimura does not tolerate Japanese business owners who profit from exploiting illegal aliens.

Kazuma Kiryu
The legendary ex-yakuza of Kamurocho and the Fourth Chairman of the Tojo Clan. One year ago, he was embroiled in the infamous Okinawa resort deal incident. He resolved the matter to protect the locals, but was seriously injured in the process. Although his wounds were not fatal, he was forced into a long period of recuperation. Now in 2010, he is living happily in Okinawa with Haruka after a full recovery.

PART 1: SHUN AKIYAMA
Chapter 1: THE INFAMOUS LOAN SHARK
March 1st, 2010
Kamurocho, Tokyo

[Shun Akiyama is reading a newspaper while lying on the couch in his Sky Finance office. His desk is crammed with books and documents. There are a lot of sheets of paper attached to the information board. The ashtray is full of cigarette butts.]

Akiyama: A serial killer, now? Scary shit… 

[He throws the paper on the table.]

Newspaper: Murder Spree Rocks Kamurocho! Serial Killer on the Loose! 

[The phone in the office starts ringing, but Akiyama goes to sleep and doesn't answer. After that, his cell phone rings.]

Akiyama: All right, all right! Hm? Hana-chan? Hey, how's it hanging? 

[From the phone comes the voice of an energetic girl that never sits idly by.]

Hana: Oh, finally. Where the heck have you been!? 

Akiyama: What, me? I'm, uh, at a client's? 

Hana: And I'm the Queen of France. You're still at the office, aren't you? Why didn't you answer any of my calls!?  Hey! Are you even listening!? Ugh, this stupid phone… Akiyama-san? Akiyama-san! Earth to Akiyama-san! 

Akiyama: Yeah, yeah. I can hear you. Look, I'm sorry!  So what's the word? You need something? 

Hana: What? Of course I need something! Why else would I have called!? 

Akiyama: Right, sorry, okay! My bad. What can I do you for? 

Hana: Do you have any idea what day it is today? 

Akiyama: Today? Is it... Well, err… It is… Your birthday? 

Hana: No! Can you just look at the calendar!? 

Akiyama: Ohhh, right. Collection day! 

Hana: You forgot again, didn't you!? 

Akiyama: Hey, come on now, I didn't forget. I was just giving it some time, waiting for the, uh... You know.

Hana: I don't know. For what!? 

Akiyama: Isn't it obvious? For the rain to stop. 

Hana: It's been dry out there for hours, Chief. Now would you please get moving? I'll be back just after I swing by Kanrai for a kalbi bento. See you soon. 

[Akiyama goes outside and lights a cigarette. His office is located in the same building as New Serena!]

Akiyama: Great. Now it starts back up. (Guess I'll start my rounds over in the Hotel District. Better get moving. Hana-chan'll chew me out if I don't hurry…)

[He walks a few meters and encounters an old man in traditional Japanese clothing.]

Mysterious Old Man: You there... Halt.

Akiyama: What's cracking, old man?

Mysterious Old Man: My name is not "old man." I am Sotaro Komaki, a master of the most esoteric martial arts known to man.

Akiyama: O... kay. And what do you want with me?

Komaki: Simply put, I can sense one's physical ability merely by observing the gait of their walk. And you, my suave friend, appear to be an especially promising specimen.

Akiyama: Hold up, you're not trying to get me to join some kinda kooky dojo, are you? That stuff's not really my style.

Komaki: You needn't join anything. Take this.

You got a Memo.

Komaki: Any information you glean from these memos will not only grant you knowledge but worldly experience. Now go forth, and let your brain soak up information like the sponge it is!

Akiyama: ...Sure. Thanks, old man.

[Next, on Theater Square, he meets three thugs...]

Street Punk: Well, well, well. If it ain't our good friend Akiyama-san.

Displeased Man: Looks like Sky Finance's flying sky high. You out to collect?

Akiyama: (Great, a pack of loan shark heavies. Just what I needed.) Hey, guys. How's business over at Kamurocho Loans?

Kobayashi: It's shit, thanks to you and your company. You're a regular pain in the ass.

Ito: Got that right. I hear you don't even charge interest on the loans you dish out. You're stealing away all our customers.

Takahashi: C'mon, we're both lenders here. Let's all play by the rules and everyone'll do just fine.

Akiyama: Rules? Pfft. You guys aren't even a legitimate business. What rules do you play by? You don't seem to mind bullying folks into borrowing, or plastering up ugly ads all over. My customers find me on their own. If anyone's a pain in the ass here, it's you.

Takahashi: So we got a tough guy, do we? I'd watch that big mouth of yours if I were you.

Akiyama: Oh, and one more thing. You and me? Don't think we're in the same league. Heck, we're not even playing the same game.

Kobayashi: Shut your trap, dickweed!

Ito: You've been pissing me off for a while now. I'm gonna enjoy flattening your ass!

[Akiyama polishes the asphalt with them and stretches a bit.]

Akiyama: One thing the loan business and a street fight have in common? You gotta know who you're dealing with.

Kobayashi: Ugh...

Ito: Grr... We'll be back!

Akiyama: (Guess I'll go collect some debts.)

[He encounters a fat guy in a plaid shirt, familiar from the previous game as an arms dealer.]

Kamiyama: Hey, you... You really laid it on those guys back there. I can tell you're on the side of justice.

Akiyama: Oh yeah? I appreciate the compliment, but I'm actually kinda in a hurry here.

Kamiyama: Oh, wait! Uh, here... Take this, please! Take a look at it when you have the time!

You got a Kamiyama Weapon Catalog.

Akiyama: A weapon catalog? What're you trying to imply here?

Kamiyama: Oh, nothing at all! Promise! I just thought you might be interested in my... choice wares. They'd be sure to help you out in a pinch, so stop by my shop if you're interested. You know that back alley up in the northeast part of the city? That's where I'm shacked up. It's a bit of a maze back there... so sorry in advance. Anyway, see you later. Hope you stop by soon!

[As he continues toward the grocery store, Akiyama notices a guy walking past him.]

Akiyama: (Hm? That was Kido-chan from Kanemura Enterprises... What's got him in a hurry? I should drop in and see what's up. Debt collection can wait.)

[Akiyama walks stealthily toward the Kanemura Enterprises office. Kido enters the office. There he is greeted by two young goons.]

Guy in the Purple Shirt: (bows) Oh, evenin'. Geez, Aniki, you're soaked to the bone. 

Kido: Where's Arai-aniki? 

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Off with the big man Shibata, taking a look at the new building. 

Kido: Kamurocho Hills? 

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Yup. The boss says we gotta jump in there before construction starts rolling. Get nice and cozy with the Majima Family, you know. 

Kido: Like bait playing with the sharks. 

[The Guy in the Purple Shirt tries to light a cigarette for Kido, but the cheap lighter doesn’t work. Kido tries to light the cigarette himself with another cheap lighter, but it doesn't work either. In a rage, he throws it into the trash and misses.]

Kido: Shit! 

Guy in the Purple Shirt: What's wrong, Aniki? You seem real tense. Something happen? 

Kido: You know Club Elnard over on Shichifuku? Some Ueno dickwads are lighting the place up. 

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Ueno? You mean the Ueno Seiwa Clan? 

[The Guy in the Green Jacket brings a towel for Kido.]

Kido: Yeah. The two of 'em have been drinking there since eight o'clock.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Gotcha. But all they're doing is drinking, right? What's so bad about that? Not like they're making any trouble.

Kido: Moron. Them being there in the first place is trouble.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: I don't think I understand.

Kido: Even you know our family's buddy-buddy with the Ueno, right?

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Yeah. Think I saw it in a magazine once.

Kido: Well, the relationship ain't exactly fifty-fifty. We're technically family and all, so the Tojo stays off Ueno turf, sure. But that's only 'cause the Ueno Seiwa give the Tojo a nice big "donation" every month.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: That so!?

Kido: They're only equals in name. The Ueno's just another cog in the Tojo machine, same as us. Think of it like this. The Tojo Clan's America, making the Ueno Seiwa Japan. Get it now?

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Sorry, uh… Can you run that by me again?

Kido: Are you deaf!? Not like it matters to a small-time family like us. We're bottom of the ladder.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Aniki? So long as you don't mind backtracking. Even if all that stuff about the Tojo and Ueno is true… What exactly's the problem? I mean, you said the Ueno and Tojo are family, yeah? Then who cares if their boys crash our club? What's the big deal?

Kido: (kicks the table) You dumbass! How do you still not get it!? I swear, you're useless sometimes!

[Akiyama enters.]

Akiyama: Yo.

Kido: Oh, Akiyama-san. Good seeing you.

Akiyama: I'm not interrupting, am I? I can come back.

Kido: No, no. Of course not. Please, sit.

Akiyama: Today's collection day. Figured I’d give Kanemura a little house call while I was at it. Looks like I missed him.

Kido: Yeah. He, uh... had some things he needed to take care of.

Akiyama: Oh yeah? No Arai, either?

Kido: Uh, yeah. He's out with the head of the Shibata Family.

Akiyama: Figures. So, let's hear the rest of that story. About why those Ueno goons can't drink on Kanemura Enterprises turf. You're not gonna spell it out for your pals here?

Kido: You heard all that?

Akiyama: The way you were shouting, they probably heard you across the street.

Kido: Sorry. Man, that's embarrassing.

Akiyama: Hey, kid. You new here?

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Um, yeah. Been about three months now.

Akiyama: Huh. And before that, you were just another small-time crook out on the streets?

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Uh, more or less.

Akiyama: But seeing Arai-san brought you around, made you wanna join up.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Y-Yeah.

Akiyama: Thought so. Good for you.

Kido: Um, Akiyama-san? If you've got business with the boss, I can have him drop you a line later.

Akiyama: You kicking me out?

Kido: Not at all, it's just... I don't know when he's gonna be back. We're kinda busy here, too.

Akiyama: Busy, right. Of course you are. Say no more. 

[He goes toward the exit.]

Akiyama: It's gonna be one hell of a night. A couple of strays digging holes on the alpha dog's turf? Well, that's just not right. You get me? Forget about all that clan and family stuff for a minute. Let's say you wanted to grab a drink out on the town. Would you do it at a place owned by your boss Kanemura-san's boss? Start acting like hot shit on Shibata Family territory?

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Well, no.

Akiyama: Right? Of course you wouldn't. That'd be a kick in the nuts to both Shibata and Kanemura-san. I think you know whose nuts Arai-san would be coming to kick after that. That's exactly what's happening now. The Ueno Seiwa Clan's stomping around on your turf. Kamurocho belongs to the Tojo. Always has, always will. But here they are, flying Ueno colors. That's a big no-no. See what I'm getting at?

Kido: Hold on, Akiyama-san.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: What are you saying?

Akiyama: Simply put, they're pissing all over you boys here at Kanemura Enterprises. Those Ueno thugs are probably thinking nobody can stop 'em muscling in on your property. Sure, you're under the umbrella of the Tojo's Shibata Family. But you've got what, five men? It's practically baby's first yakuza.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Hold up. You talking shit on us?

[The Purple Shirt Guy is already getting ready to punch Akiyama. Akiyama looks at him mischievously. He's clearly taunting the guy.]

Akiyama: That's the spirit. Sorry 'bout that, Kido-chan. Me and my big mouth, am I right? (to Purple Shirt Guy) You'll make it here, kid. Stick with it. Being a yakuza's about more than just rank. A guy who doesn't get pissed when someone disrespects his family isn't worth keeping around! Ain't that right, Kido-chan?

Kido: Uh, yeah.

Akiyama: Anyway, chin up. You've got some peacekeeping to do. I'll be in the red in no time flat if you guys can't take care of business. Got that, friend?

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Uh, if you say so.

Akiyama: Guess I'll be taking my leave, then. Later.

[He stops half the way out of the office.]

Akiyama: Oh, and Kido-chan.

Kido: Yeah?

Akiyama: I've got some words for Kanemura-san. (loudly) Tell him his yakuza days are numbered if he doesn't bite back when a stray attacks. Remember, I don't loan cash to wannabe yakuza so you can balance the books on your tribute. Oh, and make sure he doesn't forget the terms of our little agreement. Later.

[He finally leaves. Kido sighs in relief. Kanemura walks out of his office.]

Kido: (bows) Boss! You were here this whole time?

Kanemura: I was.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Like... the whole time?

Kanemura: That jackass Akiyama finally leave?

Kido: Yes, sir.

[He lights a cigarette for Kanemura with a big and expensive lighter.]

Kanemura: What a damn headache. How are we gonna deal with this Ueno situation?

Kido: I'll reach out to Arai-aniki right away.

Kanemura: Isn't he out lathering up Shibata, though?

Kido: I'll keep calling until I get through.

Kanemura: Suit yourself.

Kido: What should we do if those Ueno boys start causing trouble?

Kanemura: Good question...

Kido: Whatever we do, we should keep it under wraps. I'm sure Arai-aniki can fix this discreetly.

Kanemura: Good. No need to rock the boat. Tell Arai this is on him now.

Kido: Yes, sir.

[Kanemura leaves the office.]

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Um… Who was that Akiyama guy, anyway?

Kido: Oh, him? Shun Akiyama, age thirty-two. He runs a loan company called Sky Finance over on Tenkaichi Street. They call him the Lifeline of Kamurocho. Guy lends money to people with nowhere left to turn.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: So he's a loan shark?

[Meanwhile Akiyama walks into a grocery store near Kanemura’s office. He buys some beer and snacks.]

Kido: Not sure he'd call himself that, but that's pretty much spot on, yeah. Though I will say, he's kinda different. His loan terms aren't exactly what you'd call industry norm.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Terms? Like some kinda special application process?

Kido: Yeah. Before Sky Finance lends out their cash, they need to see if the loanee is worth it. So Akiyama comes up with a test to figure out if they're up to snuff. Stuff like volunteering, helping at nursing homes. Pretty weird, if you ask me.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: What's he get outta all that?

Kido: Beats me. If the rumors are true, the guy doesn't charge a yen of interest, either.

[Akiyama approaches a homeless dwelling built out of trash near the entrance to the Purgatory. It looks like he bought it all for them.]

Guy in the Purple Shirt: How's he keep his business running, then? Seems counterintuitive.

Kido: That one's probably just an urban legend. I'm sure he's got some kinda system. Plus he drops in on his clients like he did to us today. Make sure nobody skips town, you know?

[Akiyama drinks, talks and laughs with the homeless. They have a nice heartwarming evening.]

Guy in the Purple Shirt: Weirdest moneylender I've ever heard of.

Kido: I can't get a read on the guy, no matter how hard I try. All I know is people he lends money to once never borrow from him ever again.

Guy in the Purple Shirt: How come?

Kido: Couldn't tell you. If I had to guess, they probably wanna stay as far away from that nutjob as they can.

[Akiyama notices a guy holding an umbrella helps the other rich guy sit in his car.]

Rich Guy: Thank you for your time this evening.

Umbrella Guy: Of course.

Rich Guy: At least now we know what the building's worth.

[A phone vibrates.]

Rich Guy: Is that yours?

Umbrella Guy: Apologies, sir.

Rich Guy: Go ahead. We're done for today. Nice work.

[He hands him three bills of 10,000 yen (about $260) out of the car’s window.]

Rich Guy: Treat yourself to something tasty.

Umbrella Guy: Thank you, Patriarch Shibata.

Shibata: I'll be seeing you.

[Shibata leaves. The guy with the umbrella answers the phone.]

Umbrella Guy: This is Arai. Very well. Elnard, got it. I'll be there shortly.

Akiyama: (Sounds like a little trouble's brewing over at Club Elnard. Guess I'll go check it out.)

[However, he runs into the thugs from Theater Square again!]

Kobayashi: Not so fast, tough guy!

Akiyama: Seriously, you guys again? Didn't you have enough kicks to the face last time around?

Ito: Shut it, pisshead! You're the only one getting kicked this time!

Kobayashi: Aniki, this is him. The asshole I was telling you about.

Well-dressed Aniki: So, you're Akiyama. I've heard about you and that racket of yours. Sky Finance, you call it? My boys here tell me you did a nice little number on them earlier. It's time I return the favor!

Akiyama: Look, can we just quit the chatter and get it over with? I have places to be.

Well-dressed Aniki: Smug little asshole! We're gonna bury you!

[Akiyama kicks their asses… again.]

Watanabe: Shit...!

Akiyama: Listen, guys. You mind staying out of my way from now on? We'd both be better off that way. I'm sure you've got a rep to keep up, so I won't tell folks about how I keep kicking your asses. Deal?

Watanabe: ……Fine...

Kobayashi: But Aniki!?

Watanabe: You shut your damn hole! Okay, Akiyama-san. We got nothing to do with you from now on, and nothing happened here today. You got that?

Akiyama: Oh, loud and clear.

Watanabe: You hear that boys!?

Kobayashi: Yes, Aniki...

Watanabe: We're outta here. Later!

Akiyama: (Man, talk about a waste of time. Well, I better get on over to Club Elnard.)

[He goes to the Club.]

Attendant: I'm sorry, sir, but I can't let you go in right now.

Akiyama: Huh? Why not?

Attendant: Well, the truth is... we have a minor situation going on right now. I suggest you come back when things have calmed down.

Akiyama: What kind of situation are we talking here?

Attendant: Drunken belligerence, sir. A few of our customers have had a little too much, it seems.

Akiyama: That so? Think I'll need to see this for myself.

Attendant: Sir? Sir, please wait!

[Akiyama enters the club. There, by all appearances, have been two scumbags sitting there for a long time.]

Ihara: How the shit do you still have a job, waiter!? Where's the hundred bottles of champagne we ordered!? It's been ten minutes already!

Mishima: You idiots growin' the grapes in the back room or some shit!?

Akiyama: So these are our boys, huh?

Attendant: Yes, sir. It's been going on like this for hours now. They've scared off all our other customers… Akiyama-san, wait! You can't just...!

Ihara: The hell do you want?

Akiyama: Ahh, you're drinking the good stuff. You know they mark this up like, four hundred percent at a place like this?

Ihara: Who are you? You don't look like a fuckin' waiter.

Akiyama: (tastes a drop of the alcohol) Damn, that's good! But if you really cared about your booze… You wouldn't be tossing this back like it was water.

Ihara: I'm talking to you, pretty boy. You looking to get your ass beat?

Mishima: He asked you a fucking question, dipshit!

[Akiyama ignores him.]

Mishima: Smug little. Who do you think you are!?

[He grabs an empty bottle and tries to attack Akiyama with it, but he dodges and knocks Mishima out. The girls run away in panic.]

Akiyama: Good thing it's me you picked a fight with. If I were a big, tough yakuza, this'd mean war.

Ihara: The shit, man? This wasn't part of the deal!

Akiyama: What deal?

[Kido runs in.]

Kido: Akiyama-san! What the hell's going on!?

Akiyama: You alone?

Kido: Yeah. Aniki's still gonna be a while.

Akiyama: That so?

Ihara: I'm still standing here, assholes! Wait, I get it. You bastards are trying to start a war!

Akiyama: Not sure what you mean, friend.

Ihara: Shut it! And stop trying to play the fool! At this point I don't fucking care who you are! You're dead men, both of you!

Kido: You're the one starting shit on our turf, asshole!

Akiyama: You stay put! I started this fight. So let's keep this between me and these fine gentlemen here. It has nothing to do with Ueno or Kanemura.

Kido: Akiyama-san…

Ihara: I knew it. You do know who we are.

Akiyama: (throws his business card) I run a legit business here in town. Place called Sky Finance. So believe me when I say this isn't about politics. Just one civilian kicking another's ass. No clans. No turf war.

Ihara: Asshole… That big mouth's gonna get you killed.

Akiyama: Wow. You're a feisty one, tiger. I might actually enjoy this fight for once.

Ihara: You're really pissing me off, man. Fine. You want a beating that bad, you've got one.

Akiyama: Ready when you are.

Ihara: (screams) You're dead fucking meat!

[Akiyama fights Ihara of the Ueno Seiwa Clan and defeats him. Arai enters the club.]

Kido: Aniki.

Arai: I take it these are the Ueno men.

Akiyama: Arai-san. You missed all the fun.

Arai: I see you haven't lost your touch. It's little wonder the yakuza are so lenient with Sky Finance.

Akiyama: Sorry if I went a bit overboard. These two caught me on a bad day.

[He looks in his pocket for cigarettes, but Arai quickly offers him his own. He lights a cigarette for him.]

Akiyama: You know, Arai-san. You always could read my mind.

Arai: I had to learn fast once I chose this life. If you're not quick with a light, you get a boot to the face.

Akiyama: That's not what I meant. You didn't ask why I started this fight. Not a word.

Arai: I imagine it has to do with the terms you placed on Kanemura's loan.

Akiyama: (smirks) So you know about that?

Arai: Of course. Nobody loans that kind of money unconditionally. Least of all you, Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: You know what my condition is?

Arai: Well… The boss has never told me himself, but… You want him out, don't you?

Akiyama: Real talk. You've got what it takes to make it big. Dragon of Dojima big, if you play your cards right.

Arai: You flatter me. I can't begin to compare to the fourth chairman. We're different beasts, he and I. Me inheriting Kanemura Enterprises won't change that.

Akiyama: You never know. I got to where I am in a heartbeat. And all it took was a little windfall.

Arai: I suppose you're right. I'd almost forgotten.

Akiyama: Opportunity strikes when you least expect it. The question is, when that chance comes… Will you grab it by the horns, or let it slip through your fingers? Kanemura's outfit is small, yeah. But you'd be the boss. I can think of worse starting points. Just give it some thought, will you?

[Suddenly Ihara wakes up… he pulls out a revolver.]

Ihara: Bastards!

Arai: Akiyama-san. I don't mean to cut you out, but we'll handle it from here. (to Ihara) It's your move. Are you sure you want to pull that trigger? Do you really have what it takes? Shoot, and there will be unimaginable consequences. You leave quietly, and we pretend none of this ever happened. Your choice.

Ihara: (nervous) The hell do you think you are? The Ueno Seiwa name's on the line here!

Arai: I'm well aware of that. But if you shoot… I'll return the favor. I won't ask why you decided to stop in here to begin with. Just give me the gun. Nice and easy.

[He walks towards Ihara.]

Ihara: Stay back! Don't move!

[Ihara shoots.]

Kido: Aniki! Aniki! Aniki! Hang in there! Aniki!

Ihara: Shit! We're outta here, Mishima!

Arai: I’m fine. It only grazed me. They're the real problem now.

Kido: Goddammit!

[Ihara and his friend leave the club.]

Arai: Kido! I'll be okay here. You get after them.

Kido: Got it!

Arai: And Kido! One more thing. Don't do anything stupid once you catch them.

Kido: I won't! (runs away)

Arai: Sorry to drag you into this, Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: Pretty sure it's the other way around, isn't it?

Arai: No. Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

Akiyama: ……

[Arai’s phone rings.]

Arai: Hello... What? Don't worry, I'll find them.

Akiyama: Kido-chan?

Arai: Yeah.

Akiyama: Figured.

Arai: I've got some business to tend to.

Akiyama: Right... Well, give my regards to Kanemura-san. And make sure he remembers his loan terms while you're at it.

Arai: Very well.

[Akiyma leaves the club and gets a call.]

Akiyama: Hello?

Hana: It’s about time.

Akiyama: Oh, Hana-chan.

Hana: Don't “Hana-chan” me! Do you know how many times I've tried to call you!? Thirty! Three. Zero. When are you gonna learn how to pick up your phone!?

Akiyama: Right, sorry, sorry! So, what's up?

Hana: Get back to the office, now! Do you realize how long you've been gone!?

Akiyama: Huh? It hasn't been that long, has it?

Hana: It's been four whole hours! A sixth of a day!

Akiyama: Ah…

Hana: See what time it is, Chief? Midnight! Twelve o' five, to be exact! It's already tomorrow! Normal people are at home! Sleeping!

Akiyama: Yeah, yeah, I know, I know! I'm sorry.

Hana: Oh, please! The fake apology isn't gonna work!

Akiyama: No, really. I mean it.

Hana: You always just stroll into work whenever you want, no regard for the time! But me? I get here at 9 every morning, keep the books, clean the bathroom, call customers about late payments… And order takeout! You're running me ragged here!

Akiyama: The takeout's for you, though. You're always complaining about how hungry you are.

Hana: That's not the point! I'm totally exhausted!

Akiyama: Okay, okay! I already said you can go home today. You have the key to the office, right?

Hana: That's just it! I can't leave!

Akiyama: Why not?

Hana: There's a bunch of scary men fighting outside.

Akiyama: What, some little street brawl? What's that got to do with you?

Hana: Are you kidding me?! What if they decide to rape me?!

Akiyama: Rape? You? Aha... Ahahahaha…

Hana: Did you just laugh?

Akiyama: Uh, nope!

Hana: (screams) It's not funny, Chief! I think one of them might even have a gun! There's no way I'm getting anywhere near those thugs!

Akiyama: A gun? Hold on, Hana-chan. Just who are these guys?

Hana: Oh, um… One of them was shouting something about an Ueno, I think?

Akiyama: Ueno?

Hana: Yeah. More importantly, I'm stuck in here! Come get me out of this warzone, Chief!

Akiyama: Hang tight. I'm on my way!

====Head for Sky Finance====
[Akiyama runs to his office and hears a shot in the alley behind him... Passersby look around in fright. Akiyama slowly walks into the alley and turns the corner. Next to the vending machine stands Arai. In his hands is a gun. Leaning against the machine on the pavement sits the corpse of some man. Arai slowly turns to face Akiyama.]

Akiyama: Arai-san?

[The corpse sitting on the asphalt turns out to be Ihara.]

Arai: Akiyama-san. You said I had a chance to make it big… But I guess it just wasn't meant to be. I'll be seeing you.

[He runs away.]

Akiyama: Arai-san!

[A young man in a dark blue jacket approaches the corpse. He calmly sits on the cot next to the corpse and examines it.]

Blue Jacket Guy: One bullet, straight to the head. Clean and simple. No quicker way to bump a guy off. (to Akiyama) Shouldn't you be running? The perp's the guy who just ran off, yeah? Do you really want to try explaining that to the cops?

Akiyama: Who are you? 

Blue Jacket Guy: I'm guessing you're not yakuza.

Akiyama: Well no, but...

Blue Jacket Guy: The force is full of nasty characters. Some will beat a confession out of you just for shits and giggles.

Hana: (from a window) Chief!

Akiyama: Hana-chan!

Blue Jacket Guy: Looks like you're out of time.

[Three policemen run into the scene of the crime. One of them pulls out a gun and aims it at Akiyama.]

Policeman: Not another step!

Akiyama: Wait, me?

Policeman: I said don't move!

Blue Jacket Guy: Hey, you've got the wrong guy! It wasn't me!

Policeman 2: Stop struggling!

Blue Jacket Guy: Sugiuchi-san sure loves his interrogations. Try not to sweat too much. Have fun.

Akiyama: Sugiuchi? You mean—Hey, hold on a sec! I'm telling you, it wasn't me! Ask the guy who just ran off! C'mon!

Hana: Chief!

Akiyama: Hana-chan!

Hana: (loudly) Chief!

Chapter 2: THE ONE
[A homeless man is sleeping on Theater Square. People walk around him without paying any attention to him. The homeless man wakes up and stretches. He turns out to be Akiyama... A powerful explosion occurs in the Millennium Tower, and money begins to fall from the sky... a lot of money.]

{Read more about these events in Yakuza Kiwami}

Akayama: Cash?

[He and the other passersby start frantically picking up money. It all turns out to be a dream. Akiyama sleeps in a cell at the police station.]

Policeman: Hey, you there! Wake up! You're free to go. On your feet.

[Akiyama enters the corridor, where he is met by Junji Sugiuchi, a police investigator.]

Sugiuchi: Good thing you had a witness. You better thank kalbi deluxe from your office for saving your ass.

Akiyama: Are you talking about Hana-chan?

Sugiuchi: The girl was half mad. Drenched to the bone by the time she got to the precinct. Kept shouting, "Chief didn't do it!"

Akiyama: (smirks) That right?

Sugiuchi: Hey, Akiyama! Stay away from those Kanemura dirtbags, got it? You might think you're some kinda saint. But giving handouts to any old shmuck off the street? All you're doing is stirring up trouble. (gently slaps his face) Just keep your pretty little face out of our way. Got that?

Akiyama: What are you getting at?

Sugiuchi: When you splash cash like it's some kinda game, you're just fueling more crime.

Akiyama: A game, huh?

Sugiuchi: You heard me. That shooting? We know you're mixed up in it all. You stirred up a hornet's nest with Kanemura. Don't be surprised when you get stung.

Akiyama: Sugiuchi-san. I have my own reasons for what I do. Why I lend to who I lend to. So I'm not planning to close up shop. Now are we done here? I have places to be.

Sugiuchi: Kanemura's dead.

[Akiyama is shocked by this news.]

Akiyama: When?

Sugiuchi: While you were sleeping like a baby. Listen. Keep your paws out of this business with Kanemura and the Ueno Seiwa. Set foot near Kanemura's boys again, and we'll hang you out to dry. Scout's honor.

[Akiyama returns to the street. His phone rings.]

Hana: Oh, Chief! I finally got a hold of you! I'm so glad you're out! I thought you'd be in the slammer for weeks, months... maybe even years!

Akiyama: Uh, Hana-chan, you know I was only there for questioning, right? They didn't actually arrest me…

Hana: Whatever it was, I'm so relieved! All that running I did down to the station paid off!

Akiyama: Yeah, you really came through for me, Hana-chan. I appreciate it.

Hana: Hehe! By the way, Chief… While you've been lounging around in jail, work's been piling up there's no tomorrow! Get back to the office, now!

Akiyama: Hana-chan, please. I barely slept a wink last night. I'm seriously wiped out here...

Hana: And whose fault is that, hm? All of that nonsense yesterday could have been avoided if you just did your job. Don't let me down this time, Chief. We have tons of work to do! *beeps* *beep*

Akiyama: Hana-chan? Hellooo? (She hung up on me... Might as well head back to Sky Finance.)

[He returns to his office and sits down in a chair. There is a box with a handwritten note on the table.]

社長♥
ちゃんと食べて
くださいね

[The note translates as "Don't forget to eat, Chief!" There is a price tag on the side of the box that says 特選力儿匕弁当2500円 (Premium Ramen Lunch Box $20). Akiyama opens the box.]

Akiyama: It's ice cold.

[He puts a cigarette in his mouth.]

Akiyama: Hm? Where'd I put that lighter...?

[Looking for a lighter, he opens a desk drawer and finds a photo of a group of young people. One of them is Akiyama.]

Akiyama: The hell? (closes the drawer) Stupid.

[A young girl in large sunglasses enters his office.]

Woman: Excuse me.

Akiyama: Ah, hello there! How can I help you? Come in, come in.

Woman: Um…

Akiyama: Yes?

Woman: I'm looking for Sky Finance. Am I in the right place?

Akiyama: Sure are. Sorry, I know it's a bit of a hassle to find. Please, please. Have a seat.

Woman: Thank you.

[The woman sits on the couch completely silent. Apparently she has a severe emotional state. It's like she's disconnected from reality.]

Akiyama: So...

Woman: Yes?

Akiyama: Are you... here for a loan?

Woman: Yes, I… Um…

[The woman removes her glasses and Akiyama recognizes her. She is one of the young people in his photo.]

Akiyama: Yeah?

Woman: Do you mind if I smoke?

Akiyama: Oh, not at all. Go right ahead. Sorry about the mess. My secretary usually handles the customers. 

[He shakes out a clogged ashtray in the trash.]

Akiyama: I never think to clean this stuff up. 

[He offers her the ashtray.]

Akiyama: Be my guest.

[The woman smokes for a minute.]

Woman: Thank you.

Akiyama: Now, uh…

Woman: Yes?

Akiyama: About that loan you wanted.

Woman: Oh, yes. The truth is… Um...

Akiyama: Go on.

Woman: Well, um… I heard you offer limitless loans. No guarantor, no collateral needed. Is that true?

Akiyama: Limitless, huh? And where did you hear that?

[The woman looks away.]

Akiyama: Can't say, huh? Well, it's fine. I imagine some other lender who turned you down pointed you my way. Fed you a line like, "We can't give you a loan, but Sky Finance just might." That and half a dozen other things, I bet. We're not exactly popular with the rest of the industry, you seeю So, how much do you need?

Woman: Um…

Akiyama: Hey, mind if I borrow your lighter?

Woman: Yes, be my guest.

[He lights his cigarette and reads the inscription on the woman's lighter. It says キャバレー大女優 which can be translated as Cabaret “Experienced Ladies”]

Akiyama: Drama Queen? Sorry, you just don't see many places with names like that in Kamurocho. Is that where you work?

Woman: Oh, no. That is, I don't work there anymore.

Akiyama: Have you been in the business long?

Woman: Yes. A while, I suppose.

Akiyama: So. Name your figure. There's no way I can help you if you don't tell me how much you need.

Woman: A hundred... million. That's the amount, in cash. Within the next ten days, if that's at all possible.

{A hundred million yen is about $865,000.}

Akiyama: A hundred million.

Woman: Yes, sir.

Akiyama: And your guarantor?

Woman: I don't have one.

Akiyama: Any collateral?

Woman: No, sir.

Akiyama: No guarantor. No collateral. And you want it all at once in cash. Do you realize just how much you're asking for?

Woman: I'm sorry, this is crazy. I should never have brought it up. It was foolish of me to impose. Please, just forget this ever happened. I'm sorry to have wasted your time. Now if you'll excuse me…

[He walks towards the door.]

Akiyama: Hold on. I never said I wouldn't lend you the money. Now sit. Let's talk about this over tea. Now, here's the deal. We require each of our clients to pass a test before we finance their loans.

Woman: A test?

Akiyama: That's right. A test to gauge whether or not we can trust you.

Woman: Trust me...?

Akiyama: Yep. We test all of our customers before agreeing to loan them anything. We had one person care for the elderly for a week and another pick up all the litter in Kamurocho. We even had one woman work in the red-light district.

Woman: ……

Akiyama: The tests get more difficult depending on the loan amount and terms. And in your case, well...

Woman: The test will be hard. 

Akiyama: ...You got it. But if you pass, I promise to loan you the amount you want under the terms you specified. Those are my terms. If you don't pass the test, I'm afraid I can't offer you the loan. And about the ten days you mentioned. You really need the money that soon?

Woman: I do.

Akiyama: Pretty big hurry, huh?

Woman: Yes. That's right.

Akiyama: But if you don't pass my test, you'll have wasted some of that precious time. What do you think? Still want to give it a shot?

[The woman finishes her tea and looks confidently at Akiyama.]

Woman: Yes. I have to try.

Akiyama: And you're really sure?

Woman: This is the only option I have left. So please. Let me take your test.

Akiyama: ...All right.

[His phone rings.]

Akiyama: Mind if I take this?

Woman: Go right ahead.

Akiyama: Sky Finance.

Kido: Oh, uh, is this Akiyama-san?

Akiyama: Kido-chan! Where are you? Is everything okay?

Kido: I'm down at the Kamurocho precinct. They just finished grilling me about Kanemura-san.

Akiyama: Kanemura? What are they doing questioning you?

Kido: I'm the one who found him. Walked back into the office, and there he was... dead.

Akiyama: Sorry you had to see that. But hey, it hasn't exactly been smooth sailing on my end, either. Speaking of, I take it you've heard about Arai-san by now.

Kido: Yeah, some detective named Sugiuchi told me. I still can't wrap my head around it.

Akiyama: Me neither. Listen, we shouldn't talk about this stuff over the phone. You free to meet up later?

Kido: Yeah. I got some questions I wanna ask you, too.

Akiyama: Sure thing. Think you could call me back in a few, though? I'm just finishing up with a customer.

Kido: Oh, yeah. No problem.

Akiyama: Talk to you soon. (to the woman) Sorry about that. Seems another one of my customers is in a bit of a pinch.

Woman: It's fine.

Akiyama: So, back to business. Ten days, 100 million yen.

Woman: That’s right.

Akiyama: Understood. In that case, can I ask you to swing by again tomorrow? I'm gonna need a little time to mull that test over.

Woman: Okay.

Akiyama: Come prepared, though. We'll be starting right when you get here.

Woman: I will. 

[Akiyama walks the woman to the door.]

Woman: I'll be back. Tomorrow.

Akiyama: (bows) Looking forward to it.

[The woman walks away.]

Akiyama: Hey, uh… Your name. I never asked you your name.

Woman: Lily. It's Lily.

Akiyama: Lily-san? That your real name? Or just the one you use at work?

Woman: Does it really matter either way?

Akiyama: No... Guess it doesn't. See you tomorrow.

[Akiyama goes up to the roof of his office and pulls out his phone. He calls someone.]

Akiyama: Hey, it's Akiyama. Sorry to spring this on you last minute, but I'm bringing a new girl into the club. She starts tomorrow. Provided she actually shows up, that is. Rearrange the shifts, shuffle things around. I don't care how you do it, just make it work. ...Look, I know how to run my business. Besides, I already made up my mind. Don't let me down. Later. (The ball's in her court now...)

[Hana approaches the office.]

Hana: Oh, Chief! You actually decided to show up today!

Akiyama: Good to see you, too, Hana-chan. (Maybe I'll walk around the town while I wait for Kido-chan to call me back.)

[He leaves the office and walks a bit.]

Akiyama: Hello?

Kido: Akiyama-san, it's me. Is now a good time?

Akiyama: Yup, we're all in the clear. What's up?

Kido: There's something I gotta talk to you about. You mind if we meet up for a few?

Akiyama: Not at all. Where at?

Kido: How about that building in Theater Square? You know, the red one down the alley? We'll have some privacy there. Anyway, it's the one right across from the movie theater. I'll be waiting up on the roof.

Akiyama: Roof of the red building. Got it.

Kido: Perfect. See you there.

Akiyama: (Sounds like I should head over to Theater Square.)

[While he walks towards the Theater Square he gets another call.]

Akiyama: Akiyama speaking.

Hana: Oh, Chief. I'm so glad I caught you.

Akiyama: Why? What's up?

Hana: There's a customer who wants to see you. It seems kind of important. Can you come back to the office?

Akiyama: Yeah, hang tight. I'll be there as soon as I can.

[He decides to meet up with Kido first.]

Akiyama: (This is where I'm supposed to meet up with Kido-chan. Guess I should start climbing. Okay, I better go see what Kido-chan wants.)

Kido: So Arai-aniki really did it, huh?

Akiyama: I couldn't believe it, either. Arai-san's too smart to get trigger happy with someone like that, especially a two-bit goon like Ihara.

Kido: And nobody's seen him since?

Akiyama: Nope. I don't know if the cops are onto him yet, but he killed that creep right there in the middle of town. It's only a matter of time before they figure it out.

Kido: ……

Akiyama: How you holding up?

Kido: ……

Akiyama: You said you found Kanemura, right?

Kido: Yeah. Right after I lost those Ueno Seiwa guys.

[He tells Akiyama how he found Kanemura, and we see what happens through the cutscene. It's raining outside. You can hear the sound of thunder. Kido returns to Kanemura’s office.]

Kido: In the end, I couldn't get hold of Arai-aniki. Figured I'd head back to the office instead.

Kido: Hello? Guys? Anyone here? (knocks on the door) Boss? I'm coming in.

[He finds Kanemura lying on the couch…]

Kido: Boss? Boss, I, uh…

[Kanemura is dead. He lies on the couch half naked. The armrest of the couch on which he is lying is covered in blood. There is a trickle of blood coming out of his mouth.]

Kido: (falls on his ass) Oh, shit!

[He screams and runs off the office.]

Kido: I never got through to Arai-aniki. Wound up reporting the boss's death myself.

Akiyama: Must have been rough on you.

Kido: Apparently he got stabbed in the back. No real sign of a struggle. That's not all, though. The cops think the killer might be a woman 'cause of how they found him.

Akiyama: A woman?

Kido: Yeah. His shirt was off, and there were traces of lipstick on his neck and lips.

Akiyama: So this girl came in promising action... and gave Kanemura more action than he bargained for.

Kido: That's what it looks like. Still, something doesn't add up. It's just, well...

Akiyama: What's up?

Kido: When I got back to the office, it was completely empty. That just doesn't happen. Ever.

Akiyama: True. You usually have one or two boys keeping an eye on things out front, especially when the boss is in.

Kido: Not only that, but...

Akiyama: But?

Kido: I dunno. The boss never seemed like the kinda guy to fall for that kinda trick, no matter the girl.

Akiyama: No?

Kido: He didn't really ever talk about women or anything. And he wasn't exactly a spring chicken, if you get me.

Akiyama: I hear you… But you never know.

Kido: Huh?

Akiyama: If the police are right, she must be one hell of a woman. You ever heard of a femme fatale, Kido-chan?

Kido: A femme fatale? What's that?

Akiyama: A very special kind of woman. She might not be the most gorgeous girl in town, but you can't deny that there's something special about her. And just when it seems like you've got her, she suddenly decides to keep you at arm's length. But that only makes you want her more... and before you know it, she's the only thing you can think about. They say a girl like that'll eventually lead you to total ruin. Maybe you'll find one of your own someday, Kido-chan. A woman so alluring, you can't possibly pull yourself away.

Kido: Can't say I'd complain if I did.

Akiyama: Enough about that, though. First things first, we've got work to do.

Kido: Work?

[A dozen goons, led by a yakuza, walk on the roof.]

Kido: Who're they?

Akiyama: Shibata goons, if I had to guess. Probably here to haul us in. Isn't that right, boys?

Kido: The hell's going on, Akiyama-san?

Akiyama: You know, buddy. No matter what you do to us, the Ueno Seiwa'll still be on your backs. This is pointless.

Shibata Family Member: Guess we'll see about that. Sorry, boss's orders.

Akiyama: Hey, I'll buy you some time. Get out of here while you still can.

Kido: Are you outta your mind?

Akiyama: Nothing personal, but I can handle way more hurt than you can. Now go.

Kido: Akiyama-san!

Akiyama: I meet you back at Sky Finance. You should be safe there.

Kido: But…

Akiyama: Just go!

Kido: Okay!

[He escapes by jumping over the fence. The Yakuza and his goons try to follow him, but Akiyama stops them.]

Akiyama: Whoa there. You forget about someone?

Shibata Family Member: This ain't a game, asshole. Only way you're making this right is with a cutting board.

Akiyama: Oh yeah? Pretty stale material for a guy who does this for a living. I mean, who lops off fingers anymore?

Shibata Family Member: You think this is a joke?

Akiyama: I've been dead serious from the word go. So don't be surprised when I hand you your asses on a platter.

Shibata Family Member: Big words for a little man. Fine then. We'll show you how yakuza do things nowadays. Pretty boy. 

Akiyama: Bring it on.

Shibata Family Member: No kid gloves, boys! I wanna see this fucker bleed! Get him!

[Akiyama kicks their asses.]

Shibata Family Member: Ugh...

Akiyama: Well? Had enough?

Shibata Family Member: Dammit... We heard you were good, but we didn't know you were gonna be this good.

Akiyama: Huh, glad I have a reputation, at least. What else are they saying about me?

Shibata Family Member: You think you're so damn funny, huh? I dunno much, but…

Akiyama: But what?

Shibata Family Member: We got boys... heading to your office as we speak.

Akiyama: No kidding. Tell me something. They as tough as you?

Shibata Family Member: Heh, sure are. Top of the Shibata Family heap.

Akiyama: Perfect. Then I've got nothing to worry about.

Shibata Family Member: Whaddya mean?

Akiyama: Heh, you'll see.

[Police officers enter the roof. They are led by Sugiuchi.]

Sugiuchi: The hell do you think you're doing!?

Akiyama: Oh, brother. Just what I needed.

Sugiuchi: Another yakuza brawl, Akiyama? Really? Guess my warning didn't get through to you.

Akiyama: Sugiuchi-san…

Sugiuchi: Spare me. You can weave your yarn down at the precinct.

Akiyama: I'd really rather not. And come on, I'm the victim here.

Sugiuchi: Can it! I didn't ask for your opinion! Take him in, boys!

Akiyama: Not today!

====Escape the Police====
[Akiyama jumps the fence and runs away. The cops run after him. Akiyama manages to outrun them and reaches the roof of his office by jumping from building to building. As he makes his way down the stairs, a yakuza flies out of his door.]

Akiyama: Whoopsy. Guess I'm too late.

[A few more yakuza fly out of his office and roll down the stairs. One of them flies over the stairs but lands on bags of garbage.]

Akiyama: Lucky bastard.

Hana: Chief!

Akiyama: Honey, I'm home. (falls on the couch completely exhausted)

Hana: (puts a glass of water on the table) Thirsty?

Akiyama: Thanks. (drinks) Now I'm really gonna get it when they drag my ass downtown…

Chapter 3: TROUBLE IN THE TOJO CLAN
[Kido and Akiyama pee in the bathroom of the police station. There's a sign above the urinals 使用後は必ず流す! (Always flush after use!)]

Akiyama: Hey, how'd your little session with Sugiuchi go?

Kido: Ugh, don't get me started. That guy really puts the dick in detective. What an asshole.

Akiyama: No joke. But hey, if I were over forty and still stuck as a beat cop, I'd probably have a chip on my shoulder, too.

Kido: You think that's all it is?

Akiyama: You think it's not?

[They leave the bathroom.]

Kido: I dunno. It kinda feels like he's, like, obsessed with you and Arai-aniki or something.

Akiyama: How do you figure?

Kido: He kept grilling me about how you two met. Oh, and he wouldn't shut up about wanting to know what Kanemura's loan terms were. Doesn't that seem kinda... weird to you?

Akiyama: I guess.

Kido: Not that I can blame him for wondering. Why are you throwing your weight behind Arai-aniki?

Akiyama: That's my little secret.

Kido: C'mon, Akiyama-san! You can tell me.

Akiyama: Heh, maybe when you're older. (walks away)

Kido: Ugh, Akiyama-san…

[They're leaving. At that moment Sugiuchi comes out of the bathroom. He's been in there the whole time, eavesdropping. Akiyama returns to the streets of Kamurocho.]

Akiyama: (No pressing business right now. Maybe I'll take a little stroll around the city before heading back to the office.)

[He notices two men hitting on a woman]

Akiyama: (Hm?)

Woman: No, stop it!

Cocky Punk: What are you so worried about, honey? It's not like we're gonna take anything from you. It's all about what we're gonna give you, hehe!

Sleazy Punk: Don't worry, we'll be sure to thank you real good once we're done. So whaddya say, baby?

Woman: Someone, help!

Akiyama: (Ugh, I don't have gas in the tank for this. But I can't just sit back and watch...) Hey. I'd suggest leaving her alone if I were you.

Cocky Punk: Who's talking? We don't take advice from no-name shit off the street.

Akiyama: You should start. You're never gonna get a girl if you treat them like property instead of people.

Sleazy Punk: I'll treat a broad however I want!

Cocky Punk: Besides, who the hell do you think you are? I bet you ain't no saint yourself!

Sleazy Punk: Guess we're gonna have to educate you. And I'm not talking with a blackboard and chalk.

[Akiyama beats some good manners into them.]

Cocky Punk: Dammit... You're unreal, man...

Akiyama: And hey, turns out you were right: I'm not a saint. Not after painting your face with my shoe, at least. Run along now, kids.

Sleazy Punk: Grrr... This ain't the last you heard of us!

Akiyama: Well, now that's taken care of... Are you okay, miss?

[But the woman is gone.]

Akiyama: Oh. Guess she ran off. Can't say I'm surprised, though.

Voice: You there. Got a minute?

Akiyama: Depends. What do you need?

Well-built Man: Well, I was observing your scuffle there, and I can see your physical potential is through the roof. Did you used to play any sports?

Akiyama: Uh, not really. Pretty sure the last time I kicked a ball around was in middle school.

Well-built Man: So then it's just natural talent. Understood. My name is Saigo. I run an operation in this general area.

Akiyama: What kind of operation?

Saigo: I'm glad you ask. Do you know about the looming crisis Japan faces?

Akiyama: Crisis? What crisis?

Saigo: Put frankly, "peace addiction." Nowadays, all people in Japan can think about is peace.

Akiyama: ...Uh-huh.

Saigo: In my youth, I fought as a mercenary, mostly in the Middle East. I've seen many breathe their last, friend and foe alike. It was then I realized an astounding truth. In this world, anything can happen. Anytime. Anywhere.

Akiyama: Oh, I get it now. You're a soldier. That explains the stocky build, the fatigues, and the bald head.

Saigo: Someone as strong as yourself must realize how everyone in this city is putting themselves at risk, every moment of the day. They're too vulnerable.

Akiyama: Uh...

Saigo: Same goes for you. You're not as clever as you think.

Akiyama: Huh? What are you talking about?

[Some guy runs past him and steals his wallet.]

Akiyama: Huh? Hey! Those are the keys to my office! Give those back!

Saigo: Hahaha! You may be a good fighter, but your senses are as dull as a doorknob.

Akiyama: Did you set that up? Cut me some slack here, man! We just met!

Saigo: A strong individual like you should have no problem chasing him down. But you better get going! Who knows what'll happen if you let him get away!

Akiyama: Yeah, thanks for the advice. Ugh, here we go again...

[He chases and catches the guy.]

Akiyama: Whew... That good enough for you?

Saigo: Looks like you've got a strong set of legs. I was right about you.

Akiyama: I'm sorry, but your praise is less than flattering. Can I go now?

Saigo: Wait! I have to talk to you about something. Let's head to the roof.

Akiyama: The roof? Could you just act normal for one second?

[They go to the roof of the nearby building in Theater Square.]

Akiyama: So what did you want to talk about?

Saigo: Hey, don't look so sour. Anyways, what should I call you?

Akiyama: The name's Akiyama.

Saigo: Akiyama-kun. Seems like you get into fights nearly every day.

Akiyama: Well, I wouldn't if I had a choice. But that's just the way things have been working out.

Saigo: It's clear you have a strong talent for fighting. It'd be a tragedy to see it go to waste. Are you interested in tapping into your dormant abilities? I can help you.

Akiyama: What do you mean, dormant? Pretty sure I hand out maximum beatings every day of the week.

Saigo: Hmm... Then let me ask you: do you feel any change in your body right now?

Akiyama: Uh, change?

Saigo: A few moments ago you ran after my pupil. But you weren't simply running for running's sake. My pupil forced you to run in a style which would use your muscles in the most efficient manner. So, how do you feel? Is your body somewhat lighter than before?

Akiyama: Hm… I guess now that you say so, I do feel lighter.

You learned Dash Kick.

Saigo: Every person has to train differently, depending on their build and usual exercise regimen. Train correctly, and I guarantee your strength will be multiplied.

Akiyama: Yeah, I think I'm starting to see that.

Saigo: I'm pretty much always here, so come back whenever you want to train further.

Akiyama: That's a really nice offer and all, but can I ask you something first?

Saigo: What?

Akiyama: Why me? You don't even know me.

Saigo: Heh. I guess it's natural to be curious. It's hard to explain, but there is a reason why I chose you and only you. I'll tell you more if you agree to come back.

Akiyama: At least you sound like you know what you're talking about. All right then. I'll stop by whenever I have the time.

Saigo: Great. I'll be waiting.

[Akiyama walks toward his office. In the alleyway by the stairs leading to his door, he sees several policemen.]

Akiyama: (I have a bad feeling about this... Might as well get this over with.)

[He walks to his office.]

Akiyama: Hello? Anyone home?

[Sugiuchi is sitting on the couch.]

Akiyama: Great, just the guy I want to see.

Sugiuchi: Going somewhere, Akiyama? I mean, this is your office!

Akiyama: Gimme a break, Sugiuchi-san. We talked more than enough last time you hauled me in, didn't we?

Sugiuchi: I'm not here to arrest you; I'm here to protect you. So try showing a little gratitude for once.

Akiyama: What are you talking about?

Sugiuchi: Just sit your ass down and I'll explain. You sure took your sweet time coming back here. What kind of trouble have you been getting yourself into now?

Akiyama: Trust me, I'm too exhausted for trouble. Crazy, I know, but some of us take a break from our regularly scheduled bullshit every now and then. So, what do you want?

Sugiuchi: Notice the officers outside?

Akiyama: You know, I hadn't before, but now that you mention it, I vaguely recall one or two boys in blue out there.

Sugiuchi: Well, get used to them, wise guy. You're going under 24-hour surveillance for the next few days.

Akiyama: Huh? What for?

Sugiuchi: To keep you safe, dimwit. You and your shop. The Shibata Family's after you, aren't they?

Sugiuchi: You said so yourself, back at the precinct.

Akiyama: That doesn't mean I need your watchdogs lording over me.

Sugiuchi: Just spare me the bullshit, all right? You know who cleans up the messes you make? Us. You think babysitting a worthless crook like you is my idea of a good time?

Akiyama: C'mon, Sugiuchi-san.

Sugiuchi: Doesn't matter either way now. This dumpster fire is way bigger than a half-wit slimeball like you.

Akiyama: What do you mean?

Sugiuchi: The shooting two days ago. Shit's about to hit the fan.

Akiyama: This fan got a name?

Sugiuchi: Isao Katsuragi, captain of the Ueno Seiwa Clan. He's started making waves.

[The scene switches to the meeting room of the Tojo Clan's headquarters.]

March 3rd, 12:00 PM
Tojo Clan Headquarters

Daigo: This incident with Kanemura Enterprises… Isn't it about time we put it to rest?

[DAIGO DOJIMA. Sixth Chairman of the Tojo Clan.]

[Not far from Daigo sits a man with a huge stack of cash in front of him.]

Man: And what's this pile of cash for, Chairman Dojima?

[ISAO KATSURAGI. Captain of the Ueno Seiwa Clan.]

Daigo: Katsuragi-san. In the Tojo Clan's eyes, putting this mess behind us would be the ideal way forward. The Tojo and Ueno Seiwa have been close since the second chairman's time, 25 years ago. Surely neither side wants to see this escalate.

Katsuragi: Right. And the bloodshed between our two organizations believe this is enough to cover it, Chairman Dojima?

Daigo: Please don't misunderstand. Kanemura Enterprises is, as you mentioned, a subsidiary under the Shibata Family. But the Ueno Seiwa is different. You stand as equals to the Tojo Clan. Consider this an apology. For the undue trouble we've put you through.

Katsuragi: Equals. Huh. 

Daigo: You want more than money, then? Very well. Come in.

[Shibata enters the meeting room and bows. His right hand was wrapped with a bandage.]

[KAZUO SHIBATA. Patriarch of the Shibata Family, a Tojo Clan Subsidiary.]

[Shibata drops to his knees in front of Katsuragi and bows to the floor in the most polite way.]

Shibata: Katsuragi-san. The blame for this Kanemura affair… Lies solely on my shoulders!

[He holds out a rolled up towel to Katsuragi. Katsuragi unwraps it and places it on the stack of money. We're not shown the contents, but given the previous games in the series it's probably Shibata's severed finger.]

Katsuragi: Shibata-san, was it?

Shibata: Yes, sir.

Katsuragi: You're the patriarch of a top Tojo family. Whereas I'm captain of a nigh irrelevant clan. Please, there's no need to bow. Oh, and Shibata-san. Pinky-cutting is a relic of the past. There are far less painful ways to make amends. We're all family here, after all.

Daigo: Katsuragi-san. What are you suggesting?

Katsuragi: Chairman Dojima. Considering the Ueno Seiwa's long-standing relationship with your fine organization… We share your desire to end this madness. Even from his sickbed, our Chairman Ueno made it clear he agrees.

Daigo: Katsuragi-san.

Katsuragi: Still, a pyramid of money and a single finger doesn't even begin to settle the score. At least not in the minds of our rank and file members.

[Daigo didn't particularly like what Katsuragi said.]

Katsuragi: Chairman Dojima. Are you aware of the role Ihara served in our clan before his murder? He was a lieutenant. Promoted to that rank on the very day of the incident.

Daigo: Lieutenant, you say?

Katsuragi: That's right. What you thought was an unfortunate clash between petty thugs… In fact robbed the Ueno Seiwa blind. Stolen away on our most promising talents in the prime of his career. I’ll be frank. Ihara was an invaluable asset to our future. Money and a finger simply doesn't compare.

Daigo: No, of course. But...

Katsuragi: I know what you're going to say. You honor us by asserting we're equals. Despite the fact that you far outrank us, I appreciate that. But our members may not understand the significance that statement holds. After all, they've always thought our two organizations to be on equal footing.

[Daigo stands up abruptly from his chair.]

Daigo: Katsuragi-san. What will it take to smooth things over?

Katsuragi: Interesting question. I'd say the life of Ihara's killer. Hiroaki Arai. If not that, then we'll gladly accept control of that business Majima-san is running.

[The other participants in the meeting begin to heatedly discuss what they have heard.]

Daigo: Kamurocho Hills... You want ownership?

Katsuragi: That's right.

Daigo: That's not going to happen. (strictly) I won't allow it!

Katsuragi: And why is that?

Daigo: We're not talking one or two billion yen here. This is hundreds of times that! I'm sure Ihara was important. But no one man can possibly be worth that much.

Katsuragi: Please, Chairman Dojima. Don't get me wrong here. The Ueno Seiwa Clan isn't interested in money. This is a matter of yakuza honor. Chairman Dojima. I've heard you're a reasonable man. Can't you understand the position your men have put us in here? As I said before. Arai's head would be more than enough to appease us. Our clan members no doubt feel the same. And so, on the off chance you can't arrange that… Your only option will be to offer us someone of the same rank as Ihara.

Daigo: You mean...

Katsuragi: Yes, Majima-san. Kashiwagi-san is gone, and the Hakuho Clan and Nishikiyama Family are simply words in the history books now. Same for the Hamazaki Family. By default, that leaves only Majima-san. The only fair payment for the loss of Ihara. But of course, I couldn't possibly suggest you offer Majima-san's life as compensation. That's why I'm giving you an alternative solution. We'll make do with his property alone.

[Daigo grinds his teeth in anger.]

Katsuragi: Please think it over before you finalize your decision. Until then.

[He leaves the meeting room. We’re back to Sky Finance.]

Sugiuchi: That about sums it up.

Akiyama: ...Huh.

Sugiuchi: And the end result? The Tojo, particularly Shibata's crew, are scrambling to track Arai down before the cops or the Ueno Seiwa get their claws on him. Too bad nobody's got a clue where he is. We've been keeping an eye on the people he's buddy-buddy with, hoping he'll try and make contact. Which lands us in the here and now.

Akiyama: So that's why you've been hounding me and Kido.

Sugiuchi: Pretty much. So, we're gonna be keeping this dump you call an office under our thumb for a while. Which means no waltzing around town like it's business as usual. Got that?

Akiyama: Noted.

Sugiuchi: Good. I'm out of here.

Akiyama: Just a sec there, Sugiuchi-san.

Sugiuchi: What now?

Akiyama: You're in Criminal Investigation, right? Why go out of your way to poke your nose into this?

Sugiuchi: Hm?

Akiyama: I thought Organized Crime is usually in charge of this kinda stuff. 

Sugiuchi: That's none of your damn business. 

Akiyama: Sorry, just curious. Though if you ask me, I'd bet you're hoping to score enough brownie points to finally bag that nice, fat promotion from HQ.

Sugiuchi: You shut your damn mouth! I said stay out of it!

Akiyama: All right, all right. Forget I said anything.

Sugiuchi: Does make me think, though... What am I even doing anymore?

Akiyama: Uh, Sugiuchi-san?

Sugiuchi: ...Forget it. Just thinking out loud for a sec there. You see a lot of shit go down when you've been on the force almost three decades. Hey. Looks like you got a customer.

Akiyama: Hm?

[Lily enters the office.]

Lily: Excuse me...

Akiyama: Oh, I've been waiting for you. Please, sit.

[Sugiuchi walks out of the door. He stands outside the door for a while, pondering, and then leaves.]

Sugiuchi: ……

Akiyama: Thanks for stopping by.

Lily: No, I should be thanking you.

Akiyama: If you say so. Now, you're sure you wanna do this?

Lily: Yes. I have nowhere else to turn. Whatever the test, I'm prepared to take it.

Akiyama: Great. Then let's get started.

Lily: Okay.

Akiyama: You ready to go?

Lily: Go? Where?

Akiyama: Out on the town. The first part of the test is a date with yours truly.

Lily: A date?

Akiyama: Let's see... How about we start by buying you a nice new dress? Oh, and maybe a necklace or two.

Lily: Shopping? You know I can't afford that right now...

Akiyama: What kinda guy makes his date foot the bill? Come on, it's my treat.

Lily: Huh? But...

Akiyama: Sorry, but this is part of the test. We need to make you as stunning as possible.

Lily: ……

Akiyama: You said you'd do whatever it took, right?

Lily: ...That's right.

Akiyama: Great. Shall we, then?

[They leave the office.]

Akiyama: You ready? Where would you like to start: your dress or your accessories?

Lily: I don't mind either way, but... are you sure about this? I feel bad, having you buy so much for me.

Akiyama: It's nothing, honestly. Like I said before, we need to make you absolutely stunning. Now, let's go!

[They go to a shopping center nearby.]

Akiyama: Milestone's one of my favorite dress shops. I'm sure they'll have something here that suits you.

Lily: All right…

Employee: Good to see you, Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: Hey there. I'm here looking for a nice new dress for this girl here. Think you could help me pick something out for her?

Employee: Of course, sir. Let's see... What do you think of these?

[Akiyama chooses a dress.]

Employee: Thank you very much. That dress is absolutely perfect for you, if you don't mind me saying!

Akiyama: You can send the bill over to my secretary Hana-chan. Sorry for the trouble.

Employee: It's no trouble at all, sir! We'll do just that. Please come again soon,

Akiyama: That takes care of the dress. Next comes the accessories! Let's pay a visit to Le Marche, shall we?

Lily: Okay.

[They go to the most expensive jewelry store in Kamurocho.]

Akiyama: Let's buy some accessories here. I'll find something that looks good on you.

Lily: Okay...

Employee: Welcome, Akiyama-sama. Looking for something in particular?

[Akiyama chooses a necklace.]

Employee: Will that be all for you, sir?

Akiyama: Yeah, that's all. You can send the bill over to my secretary Hana-chan. Sorry for the trouble.

Employee: No trouble at all, sir. Let me walk you to the door. Thank you, sir. We hope to see you again soon.

[Akiyama and Lily leave the store.]

Akiyama: That just leaves your hair, makeup, and nails. You mind going it alone from here? All that will probably take a while. Just tell them Akiyama said to put it on Sky Finance's tab.

Lily: Thank you.

Akiyama: Meet me over at Elise once you're done. It's right across the street from the Millennium Tower. I'll be waiting for you.

Lily: Okay.

[After a while, Akiyama comes to Elise and approaches the manager.]

Akiyama: Hey, is Lily-chan here yet?

Elise Manager: She's waiting in the back room, sir. Right this way.

Akiyama: Okay. Let's get started.

Lily: Yes, let's.

Akiyama: First, let's get you changed into an outfit that brings out the best of your natural beauty. Don't worry, I guarantee you'll look great.

[He puts a dress and a necklace on her. He decides what and how to wear it. After a while, Lily walks out into the hall in her new look.]

Lily: Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: Wow. I had high hopes, but... wow.

[Lily’s confused.]

Akiyama: It's nothing. Anyway, on to part two of your test.

[They sit on the couch.]

Akiyama: All right, part two. You ready?

Lily: Yes.

Akiyama: Good. Now, I want you to entertain me as if I were a customer.

Lily: A customer?

Akiyama: That's right. You've just been hired as a hostess, after all. You're gonna be the number one girl here.

Lily: Me, number one...? But why?

Akiyama: Well, as it turns out, I own the place. We manage to stay in the black, but in this economy, well... We're basically treading water.

Lily: Oh…

Akiyama: And that's where you come in. A new face to freshen up our lineup could really boost sales.

Lily: I see. Um...

Akiyama: Yeah?

Lily: I understand the test, but... I'm not sure I can reach number one.

Akiyama: That so? Then I guess you don't need the hundred million.

Lily: What?

Akiyama: We haven't even started, and you've already decided you can't do it. We should just call the whole thing off.

Lily: No... I'll do it. Please.

Akiyama: That's the spirit. And don't worry, you're number one material exactly as you are.

Lily: Speaking of, how do you determine a hostess's rank? Is it by sales?

Akiyama: You got it. Starting today, you'll have three days to make us three million yen.

Lily: Three million? In three days?

Akiyama: Do that and you pass the test. I'll loan you the hundred million yen, no collateral, no guarantor.

Lily: ……

Akiyama: And if you can't do it, we'll just pretend this never happened. Like we discussed earlier.

Lily: Three million yen.

Akiyama: That's right.

Lily: And if I manage to make that much... you'll loan me the hundred million I want?

Akiyama: I will.

Lily: Understood. I'll do my best.

Akiyama: Okay, that's enough business talk. Let's relax for a bit, just the two of us. Don't tell me you forgot. You're supposed to act like I'm a customer.

Lily: But aren't you the owner?

Akiyama: So what? Nobody says a guy can't unwind a bit in his own club. I'm just a customer tonight. Your first on the job, turns out. Hey, there's the smile! Not bad! All right, let's get this party started!

Lily: You got it. So then, sir. What are we drinking tonight?

Akiyama: Let me think…

[They talk for a while.]

Akiyama: Well, I should probably get going. Got some other things to take care of. You know how it is.

Lily: Leaving already? But we only just got started.

Akiyama: Sorry. Can't have the owner keeping his future number one all to himself. It's bad for business.

Lily: Of course...

Akiyama: But what do you say we meet up after your shift?

Lily: Hehe, are you asking me out on another date?

Akiyama: If you want me to be.

Lily: Okay, then. It's a date.

Akiyama: Great, we'll reconvene in Theater Square. See you there.

Lily: Okay.

[Akiyama goes to Theater Square and waits for Lily. His phone rings.]

Elise Manager: Akiyama-san, this is Tanuma from Elise. Lily-san just went home, and I've finished totaling her sales for today.

Akiyama: Great, thanks. How'd she do?

Elise Manager: Just over half a million yen. That's amazing considering it's only her first day.

{Half a million yen is about $4,400.}

Akiyama: Pretty impressive, yeah. But she's gonna have to step up her game if she actually wants to pass.

Elise Manager: True… Maybe you could drop in during her next shift? It might help having you there to give her some pointers, Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: Not a bad idea. Sure, why not.

Elise Manager: Thank you, sir. See you then.

[Lily approaches Akiyama.]

Lily: Sorry I'm late. 

Akiyama: Oh, no worries at all. Nice work today, by the way. Getting used to it?

Lily: Yes, but...

Akiyama: Hm? But what?

Lily: I'm a little worried about how much I made today. It didn't feel like very much.

Akiyama: Do you want to know the actual number?

Lily: If you don't mind... Yes, I would.

Akiyama: All right, here goes. Your total for today came out to...

Lily: ……

Akiyama: 500,000 yen.

Lily: That's... it?

Akiyama: Hm? Why the long face? That's pretty dang impressive.

Lily: No, I know... But that still leaves another two and a half million in only two days.

Akiyama: Don't worry. Today was all about settling into the job. And hey, you didn't even have a full shift.

Lily: I suppose...

Akiyama: Seriously, you'll be fine. I'm sure of it.

Lily: Hehe...

Akiyama: What's so funny?

Lily: You're a very interesting man, Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: Yeah?

Lily: You say this is a test, but now here you are telling me everything's going to be fine.

Akiyama: What's wrong with that? It's not like I want you to fail or anything.

Lily: Don't you?

Akiyama: Of course not. I want nothing more than to lend you that money. It might be a test, but I've been hoping you'd succeed from the bottom of my heart.

Lily: Akiyama-san...

Akiyama: Plus, I know you're not gonna just take failure lying down. Not with that much money on the line.

Lily: Yes... You're right. I can do this.

Akiyama: That's more like it. Just try not to stress too much, yeah? Keeping cool is half the battle.

Lily: Okay.

Akiyama: Now, how about we enjoy this date? Anywhere special you'd like to go?

Lily: Um... Can I ask you something first? Why are you being so nice to me?

Akiyama: Well, because you're worth it.

Lily: I'm not sure I understand. This isn't part of the test, is it?

Akiyama: Not exactly... But hey, remember the date we were on earlier? Let's just call this part two.

Lily: So it is part of the test, then. And here I was ready to join you E on an actual date.

Akiyama: Look, it doesn't matter what it is. Just keep me company for a while, okay? ...Now that's settled, where do you want to go? Your pick.

Lily: Hm, I get to choose?

Akiyama: Anywhere you want. Don't worry if you can't think of a place, though. I have plenty of spots we can stroll into if need be.

Lily: Oh, well... There actually is somewhere I'd like to go. You're sure you don't mind?

Akiyama: Of course not. So, where to?

Lily: A bar I've heard about over in the Champion District. I think I'll recognize it once we get there.

Akiyama: Yeah? All right, then. Let's go.

[They go to some old building in the Campion District. Lily looks around not knowing where to go next.]

Lily: Hm...

Akiyama: Is it somewhere in here?

Lily: Yeah, I think so. Though... I don't remember this building being here before.

Akiyama: Really? It's been around at least as long as I have. Probably way longer.

Lily: Do you think we could head inside? I'd like to see it for myself if you don't mind.

Akiyama: Oh, uh, sure...

[They go to the roof of the building.]

Lily: Wait... I do know this building! It really brings back memories being up here.

Akiyama: Yeah?

Lily: Though back then it was one of the taller buildings in the area. It really stood out. I probably didn't recognize it because of how small it seems in comparison nowadays.

Akiyama: Did you used to come around here a lot?

Lily: I... lived here, yes. Honestly, it feels like that was a lifetime ago.

Akiyama: Huh...

Lily: Those were the days. Sure, I was always broke and lived in a tiny apartment... But life was good.

Akiyama: Lily...

Lily: Tell me something. Why are men always so busy looking upward?

Akiyama: I'm sorry?

Lily: They work themselves to death for that one big break, and they end up forgetting the girl by their side in the process.

Akiyama: I suppose a guy in my line of work is kinda biased, but… Whether it's family or the one you love, it's tough to make anyone happy without money. Men tend to take that responsibility pretty seriously. We're all desperate to claw our way up to someplace stable. That's my theory, anyway.

Lily: I'd be fine without all that. If things had just stayed the same, well… I would've been the happiest girl in the world.

Akiyama: So you can't stand how money changes people, yet you still came to me for a loan?

Lily: Strange, isn't it? I never really cared about it before, and now I need it more than anything.

Akiyama: Life's good at throwing you curveballs like that. Makes you wonder, though. Why does money make the world go round anyway? (lean on the rails) If money really does make people happy… Maybe I can do the same. For you.

[Lily is perplexed by Akayami's words. Taking advantage of her confusion, Akiyama kisses her.]

Akiyama: Why didn't you pull back?

Lily: I'm not sure myself. I suppose... it just felt right. Why did you kiss me?

Akiyama: Good question. But I haven't felt like this for almost five years now.

Lily: An ex-girlfriend?

Akiyama: Yup. Dumped me flat on my ass.

Lily: Oh yeah? Why?

Akiyama: Dunno. Guess my wallet was a bit too thin back then.

[Lily laughs heartily. Suddenly several thugs, led by yakuza, come out on the roof.]

Yakuza: Got a pair of lovebirds over here, huh? How 'bout you share some of that sugar with us, baby?

[Akiyama notices a pin with 柴 (shiba, firewood​) character on it.]

Akiyama: More Shibata goons? Don't you guys have better things to do?

Shibata Family Member: You got a death wish, playboy? Don't you know the Shibata run this town!?

Akiyama: Oh, I know plenty more than that. You talk big about being some kinda top-tier crime family, but you're really nothing more than the Tojo's errand boys.

Shibata Family Member: You smug little fuck! Change of plan, boys. Let's butcher him!

[Akiyama defeats the hitmen.]

Akiyama: We better get out of here before more show up… Come on!

[They run out into the street and hide in the children's park.]

Akiyama: Phew... We should be safe here. Sorry you got dragged into that. It's been an interesting couple of days.

Lily: It’s okay... 

Akiyama: Hey, are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?

Lily: No, I'm fine.

Akiyama: Much as I hate to say it, we should probably call it a night. I'd hate to run into more of them.

Lily: You're probably right.

Akiyama: Well, do your best tomorrow, all right? I'll swing by and check in on you if I can.

Lily: Okay. Good night, Akiyama-san.

Chapter 4: THE PROMISE
March 4th
3:00 PM

[Akiyama in his office with Kido.]

Kido: So that's why the Shibata Family's been on our asses all this time.

Akiyama: Yup. And how are things on your end? Any luck tracking down Arai-san?

Kido: Not in the slightest. Not yet.

Akiyama: I see.

Kido: Tojo HQ's got the entire clan looking for him, though. I’m sure it won't be long before they find him. They'll serve him up to those Ueno bastards on a silver platter if we don't do something fast...

Akiyama: Yeah... Things aren't looking so hot.

Kido: I can't just sit on my ass and wait. I gotta go find him! At least before HQ does. I have to know the truth. I mean, he'd never do shit like this without a good reason!

Akiyama: Listen, Kido-chan. Let's say Arai-san does have a reason. How exactly are you planning to explain that to the Tojo Clan brass?

Kido: Huh? What do you mean?

Akiyama: Remember, their relationship with the Ueno Seiwa's gone sour. But all that gets swept under the rug if they hand over Arai-san. The Tojo doesn't really give a damn why he did what he did... or even if he did it at all. The only thing that matters is that he's their way out.

Kido: So what, he just gets to be their sacrifice?

Akiyama: Pretty much.

Kido: But he...

Akiyama: Look, Arai-san's a smart guy. He knows this isn't about whether or not he can prove he's innocent. That's why he's gone into hiding.

Kido: (stands up) So... What do we do?

[There's three packs of 10,000 yen bills on the table.]

{I will assume that there are 50 bills in each pack, so there is 15 million yen (about $132,000) on the table.}

Akiyama: Take it.

Kido: Huh? What's this for?

Akiyama: This is the only way I can help now. Find Arai-san before the Tojo Clan or police do. We can worry about the rest then.

Kido: But Akiyama-san...

Akiyama: Use whatever money you need to track him down. I’ve got other work to do, and you're the only person I can count on.

Kido: Akiyama-san... Why're you doing all of this?

Akiyama: Let’s just say it's an investment. Arai-san's worth it.

Kido: I don't get it. Why do you care so much about Arai-aniki, anyway?

Akiyama: Does it really matter?

Kido: Yeah, actually, it does! I'm looking for him because I want answers. And I'm not taking this cash until you tell me what you're up to.

Akiyama: ……

Kido: Please. I need to know.

Akiyama: ...Fine. (stands up) Truth is, a few years back… Arai-san saved my life.

Kido: You serious, Akiyama-san?

Akiyama: Sure I am. Speaking of. You ever hear about how used to be homeless?

Kido: Well, uh... I know the rumors, at least. Is it really true?

Akiyama: You know, before I got booted to the curb… I had a job at a bank, place called Touto.

[He pulls out of his desk drawer the very photo with the group of young people in it.]

Akiyama: Just an everyday working stiff.

[He throws the photo to Kido.]

Kido: You were a banker!?

Akiyama: Yeah. But that was over half a decade ago. I was on my way to the top. Living on easy street, up until six years ago. Got a law degree from Touto University. Joined Touto Bank. Launched my career as one of the top young financial engineers in the biz.

Kido: So then how’d you wind up homeless?

Akiyama: I got fired. Back in early 2005.

Kido: Fired? What’d you do to deserve that?

Akiyama: Embezzlement. They said I was pinching money from the bank.

Kido: What? Why’d you do that?

Akiyama: I didn’t. Never touched even a single yen.

Kido: Huh? I’m not following.

Akiyama: It was a setup. The bank framed me. Slapped me with this embezzlement charge, then fired me on the spot.

Kido: That’s bullshit.

Akiyama: That’s what I thought, too. Told myself there must have been a mix-up. But a million yen went missing from one of my client’s accounts. And landed itself right in my own.

Kido: So that’s why they fired you.

Akiyama: Yep. That’s the gist of it. They told me they wouldn't press charges so long as I accepted my termination quietly. I followed every lead I could to find the truth. Blew through my entire life's savings in the process. But I struck out swinging. Ended up broke, out of the streets of Kamurocho.

Kido: Homeless, just like that…

Akiyama: I'd always thought making it big would be easy but turns out you need cash and trust to do it right. I never really had either to begin with. I was only ever playing with other people's money.

Kido: Then, where in the world did you find enough funding for your own loan business?

Akiyama: On the ground.

Kido: Huh?

Akiyama: It fell from the sky like paper rain. All I had to do was scoop it up.

Kido: You're full of it, man.

Akiyama: What, you never heard? The Millennium Tower explosion? Billions sent flying through the city?

Kido: Oh, right! But… wait, that's how you got your money?

Akiyama: Yup, at least the first million of so. Ran around like a chicken with its head cut off. I figured the big man up there was giving me another shot of life.

Kido: Man… I can tell if you're the unluckiest guy in the world or the luckiest.

Akiyama: Heh, that makes two of us. That million was as precious as life itself to me. But a guy's gotta sleep. And if you're passed out on the street… You make an easy target.

Kido: Someone take it?

Akiyama: Pack of street thugs, yeah. You ever heard of "homeless hunting"? People go around beating the crap out of the less fortunate just for a little fun.

Kido: Hold on. If this story's going where I think it's going…

Akiyama: Yup. Arai-san saved me. She was just another punk, had barely just joined up with Kanemura. But there he went, getting everything back from those bastards... All for a random homeless nobody. 

Kido: Why'd he do it?

Akiyama: Not sure... But I was so happy I cried ugly tears. That's when Arai-san promised he'd turn this town around.

Kido: Aniki… I knew in that moment.

Akiyama: If I ever made good on my million yen, I'd put all my chips on him.

Kido: What do you mean?

Akiyama: Well... I figured one of these days, he'd rise up to be king of this concrete jungle. Kamurocho attracts all kinds of people. Weak, strong, you name it. It really is a jungle out there. But there's one thing everyone who comes here has in common.

Kido: Which is what?

Akiyama: A dream. Every single person has some grand vision they're reaching for.

Kido: Like what?

Akiyama: Landing the perfect woman, hitting it rich, seizing power… Everyone's got something, no matter how insignificant that something might seem. But barely a soul actually achieves it. Even so, people don't just abandon their dreams. They're what keep us trudging onward. You get me?

Kido: Yeah.

Akiyama: People wanna see those dreams come to fruition. So what this town needs... is someone who can show them that's possible.

Kido: Someone like Arai-aniki?

Akiyama: Bingo. For better or worse, strength is what wins people over. And Arai-san's got it in spades. I've seen that first-hand. A jungle's nothing without its king. And this town needs a king now more than ever. Kamurocho's always looked to the yakuza to find its lions. But Kazuma Kiryu's out of the picture, and nobody's stepped up to fill the void. Without a leader, even the toughest prides will scatter. Find a new king somewhere else.

Kido: That's, like... pretty deep.

Akiyama: Forget all this nonsense about jungles, though. What I'm saying is, I'm putting all my chips on Arai-san.

Kido: Got it. I'm in on that dream, too. I'll find Arai-aniki, no matter what! And I'll use this money to make it happen!

Akiyama: Good. Drop me a line if you learn anything.

Kido: Of course!

[He bows. Hana enters the office.]

Hana: I'm back. Oh, Kido-san.

Kido: Heya. (leaves the office)

Akiyama: That took longer than I expected. Maybe I should go check in on Lily-chan.

Hana: What are you talking about? You've got debts to collect!

Akiyama: Hm? Did someone have a deadline today?

Hana: Today!? Try three days ago! People don't pay on time unless you remind them!

Hana: What if they skip town!?

Akiyama: All right, all right. So, uh... who are we talking about again?

Hana: The owner of Marimba, that bar in the Champion District. Now go collect that payment!

Akiyama: Marimba... Right.

Hana: Ugh, you promised you'd take care of it on time! But you went and blew it off like always!

Akiyama: Did I? Well, there's no time like the present, right?

Hana: Just make sure you actually go this time!

Akiyama: Yeah, yeah...

====Head to Marimba====
[Akiyama goes outside. His phone rings.]

Manager: Akiyama-san? This is Tanuma from Elise.

Akiyama: Hey, Tanuma. What's up?

Manager: Lily showed up for work. If you have time to spare, you should come give her some pointers.

Akiyama: Right... Okay, be there in a bit.

Manager: Great. We'll see you soon.

Akiyama: (Hana-chan's not going to like this, but I better pop by Elise for a minute.)

[He goes to Elise.]

Akiyama: Hey, I'm here to train Lily-chan. She in?

Elise Manager: Yes, sir. She's waiting in the back room. Oh, before you go, here are the funds we've set aside for her training. Please limit your spending on her to this alone.

Akiyama: Guess I don't have much choice. Good idea keeping this separate from the club's finances, though.

You got 100,000 yen in training funds.

Elise Manager: I'll also assign Naoki to assist you.

Naoki: (bows) Let me know if there's anything I can do for you, sir. I'll help however I can.

Akiyama: Sounds good.

Elise Manager: Now then, let me show you to the back room.

[In the backroom.]

Naoki: Please pick out an outfit for your hostess. You can choose different types of clothing, makeup, and other items. There are only a small number of clothes available to you at first, but you will get more as you go along. However, getting new clothes or accessories costs money. Do your best to get by on the funds that we gave you. At our club, our girls go out on the club floor to entertain customers three times during their work day. There is a short rest period between each shift. During this time, you can adjust her outfit or provide additional training. We'll talk more about training next time.

[Akiyama chooses an outfit for Lily from a large number of available options.]

Akiyama: Looking good.

Lily: You think so?

Akiyama: Of course. Now go get 'em.

Lily: Okay… I'll do my best.

Akiyama: (Guess I should take a stroll around the club. I think I'm done surveying. Time to head to the back room.)

Naoki: Akiyama-san, why don't you do a walk around the club to see what the customers are feeling tonight? Oh, but is there anything you'd like to know in the meantime?

Akiyama: I'm fine for now.

Naoki: All right, well, just ask me any time you have any questions and I'll be happy to give you an answer.

Akiyama: (Nobody's requesting Lily-chan...)

[The time is up!]

Naoki: Thank you! I'll contact you later about the results. See you next time!

[He goes outside.]

Akiyama: (Now that's settled, it's time to pay Marimba a little visit. Just gotta stroll over to the Champion District.)

[He finds a small restaurant called Marimba in a poor neighborhood. It is located in an alley where it is not easy to find.]

Akiyama: (Marimba. This is the place. Hm? It’s locked.) Anybody home? It's Akiyama, from Sky Finance. (No response. Huh. Guess I'll just have to come back later.)

[When he comes around the corner, he sees a sign just like the one on Lily's lighter.]

Akiyama: (Huh? Drama Queen? This is the place Lily said she used to work.)

[A stout man in a red woman's dress and wig approaches him.]

Okama: Hey, cutie. You into that sorta thing?

Akiyama: I’m sorry?

Okama: You were taking a mighty long look at Drama Queen there.

Akiyama: So what if I was?

Okama: Oh, you naughty boy! You know that's an Okama bar, right? Heh, what am I saying? Of course you do.

Akiyama: An okama bar? You serious?

Okama: Mmhm. And you looked awfully interested. Just saying. Don't worry, though, I'm not judging.

Akiyama: Oh, it's not like that. It's just... I know this girl who used to work here, is all.

Okama: Sure you do. I'm in denial here, too, honey. The manager here's totally my type, but he's straight as an arrow. Says he only dates “real” girls.

Akiyama: Sorry to hear that. Not the most open-minded guy in the world, huh?

Okama: Nope! But hey, forget him. Come have a drink over where I work! I'll give you a stiff one on the house.

Akiyama: Sorry, but I'm gonna have to take a rain check. Things to do, places to be. You know. Maybe some other time, okay?

Okama: Anything you say, hot stuff. I'll be waiting!

Akiyama: (Drama Queen's an okama bar, huh? Why would Lily lie about working there? Maybe I should head inside.)

[He walks into the bar and goes to the manager's office.]

Akiyama: (What the!?)

[The manager is dead. He sits on a chair at his desk, stripped down to his underwear. His skin is pale and there is a lot of blood coming out of his mouth. There are blackouts around his cloudy, bloodshot eyes. All indications are that death occurred at least six hours ago and the possible cause of death is poisoning.]

Akiyama: (He's... He's dead! Must have been like this for a few days now, by the smell of it… 

[He looks at a leather jacket on the table.]

Akiyama: (The Shibata Family crest. I guess that means the owner was in cahoots with the Shibata?)

[He looks at a stack of lighters.]

Akiyama: (Lighters with the bar's name on it. They probably hand them out to customers in the hopes that other people will see it. Viral marketing, or whatever. ...These are just like the one Lily-chan had.)

[He leaves the office.]

Akiyama: (That's probably all I'm gonna find. I better get out of here before someone sees me.)

[He goes outside.]

Akiyama: (Drama Queen's manager is dead. Murdered, and a few days ago by the looks of it. He was practically naked, too. Just like how Kido-chan found old man Kanemura. Was it the same killer? Maybe someone from the Shibata Family?)

Okama: You okay, sweetie? You look like you just saw a ghost.

Akiyama: Oh, uh, yeah...

Okama: You don't sound okay. Why don't you come relax over at my bar?

Akiyama: I appreciate the offer, but I've got places to be. Sorry.

Okama: Aww, you're no fun! (leaves)

====Head for Sky Finance====
Akiyama: (Sticking around here'll just land me in more trouble. Need to get back to Sky Finance.)

[He walks in his office.]

Akiyama: What a headache. Hope you've got the pain meds ready, Hana-chan.

[He sees that everything is scattered and Hana is lying on the floor.]

Akiyama: Hana-chan! Hana-chan! Say something!

Hana: Chief... Welcome back.

Akiyama: What happened here!?

Hana: These guys, they…

[She tells us what happened… Hana returns from the store with two shopping bags and sees Kido in the office.]

Hana: Kido-san, hope you didn't wait long! I was just out grabbing a few things!

[He reads a book from the shelf.]

Kido: Oh, uh, it's all good. Sorry for bargin' in like this.

Hana: The chief's out on collection duty right now. He should be back in just a jiff, though. Here, I'll pour you some tea.

Kido: You don't have to do that.

Hana: So what brings you by? Forget something here?

Kido: Actually, there's this thing I'm looking to run by Akiyama-san. I tried his cell and everything, but couldn't get through.

Hana: Welcome to the club. He always switches it off when he's out wandering. Says he doesn't like people ruining his "vibe." It's a wonder anything ever gets done around here!

Kido: That's Akiyama-san for you.

[A group of menacing looking men enters.]

Kido: Don't think they're here for a loan...

Hana: Again? You guys are worse than roaches. Sorry, but you're going to have to leave. The chief isn't even here. Though if you really insist, I'd be glad to kick you out myself.

[One of the thugs pulls out a gun...]

Kido: Look out, Hana-chan!

[He knocks Hana out with the handle of his gun without a word.]

Kido: Hana-chan!

Hana: Sorry, Chief. I tried to stop them, but...

Akiyama: No, I should've been here to protect you. rm the one who should apologize. Was it those Shibata goons again?

Hana: No, it was some guy named Midorikawa, from the Hatsushiba Clan.

Akiyama: Hatsushiba Clan?

Hana: That's right. And he said something about their boss and Shibata being really tight. The guy really knew how to run his mouth. He kept telling me stuff I didn't even ask about. It sounds like the Hatsushiba Clan was helping the Shibata Family track down Kido-san...

Akiyama: They're after kido-chan? Where is he, anyway?

Hana: That's just it. Kido-san was here when they showed up. Midorikawa's guys jumped him… Then they hauled him off to who knows where...

Akiyama: They took Kido-chan?

Hana: He didn't stand a chance. He was completely outnumbered.

Akiyama: Hm...

Hana: Um... Chief?

Akiyama: Oh, sorry. Just thinking about something. So they took Kido-chan. The question is: why?

Hana: No idea… Oh! That Midorikawa guy also stole our client registry! It sounded like that's what brought them here in the first place. He said he was just "borrowing" it, but I seriously doubt he'll be bringing it back any time soon.

Akiyama: Our registry? What would they want with that?

Hana: Who knows. I'm more worried about Kido-san...

Akiyama: Agreed. Sounds like I need to pay those Hatsushiba goons a little visit. Collect on what they borrowed.

Hana: Go get 'em, Chief! Just don't do anything crazy, okay?

Akiyama: I'm not going to leave you like this, Hana-chan. And where the hell are the cops? Didn't anyone see those bastards bust in!?

Hana: Don't worry about me. I already called for an ambulance.

Akiyama: Heh, you really are on top of everything, aren't you? Well, sit tight. I'm gonna go get kido-chan and that registry back.

Hana: You got it, Chief!

[Akiyama leaves the office.]

Akiyama: (Better start looking for leads on Midorikawa.)

[He hears a voice coming from the roof.]

Energetic Foreigner: Man, oh man! The perfect shot's so close I can almost smell it! Or did I forget to wear deodorant? You there! Did you see those tough dudes flashin' their muscles like it's nobody's business? Nothing quite as dangerous as a thug with something to prove. But hey, that's what Kamurocho's all about! The glitz, the glamor, the gigantic guys shaking down passersby! Not that I like that last part.

Akiyama: ("Tough dudes"? Maybe he's talking about Midorikawa.) Hold on there, buddy! Think we can talk for a sec? Sorry for flagging you down like that. Mind if we chat for a few?

Energetic Foreigner: Of course not! I love talking to washed-up porn stars. I'm Mack: photographer by trade, observer of humanity at heart! And I mean all of humanity.

Akiyama: ...Right. And sorry to break it to you, but I'm actually a moneylender. I run a place called Sky Finance, right over there. The name's Akiyama. I was hoping you'd be able to fill me in on those "tough dudes" you were talking about before.

Mack: Sure thing, slick! These scary-looking dudes were filing down the street one after the other, like the world's least cheerful conga line. Wasn't sure what was happening, but I knew something mega was about to hit! I was practically quaking in my sensible boots!

Akiyama: Back up a second. You mentioned something about a shot, too. Do you take pictures of this kinda stuff as it goes down?

Mack: These aren't any old pictures, man! I've been traveling the world for what feels like eons, searching for the photograph to end all photographs! The perfect shot!

Akiyama: ...Uh-huh.

Mack: Look at me running my mouth like it's in a dang marathon. Akiyama-san... Have you ever seen a sight so incredible, it made you realize something about the nature of the world?

Akiyama: Uh, not that I can remember.

Mack: Folks call those revelations! A flash of inspiration! A spark in the oľ noggin! A rush of idea juice flooding your mind!

Akiyama: Yeah, that's definitely never happened to me before.

Mack: Then maybe it's about time it does! And what's more, these revelations hold the key to the perfect shot! I'm sure of it!

Akiyama: ...Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, keep that in mind. Anyway, about those tough dudes you mentioned...

Mack: Hold up, the greatest idea just snapped across my neurons! Maybe you can help me try to find the perfect shot!

Akiyama: I mean, sure, but I'd really rather just hear about.

Mack: Then it's settled! C'mon, it's huntin' time! And we're hunting the biggest game of all: art!

Akiyama: (...Guess I'm just gonna have to put up with this nutjob for now.)

Mack: Don't look now, Akiyama-san, but I just caught a glimpse of something good! Train your eyes on that roof over there! Something's up with that lady... and you're gonna snap a shot of whatever it is! All you've gotta do is whip it out your phone, I mean and etch that moment into digital divinity! Don't worry, the government probably won't see your photos later.

Akiyama: ...My phone camera, huh? All right, I'll see what I can do.

Mack: Just ask me if you're shooting in the dark and I can recite all that to you verbatim! Really, every word'll be exactly the same!

[Akiyama notices a woman on a nearby roof. She searches for someone.]

Woman: Stop! Give those back! Thief!

[An extremely strange fat man with underpants on his head hangs from a crossbar. He laughs and jumps off like a superhero. He doesn't know how much "power" he has, but he falls to the pavement, dropping several bras he stole. Akiyama takes a picture and makes up a caption for it.]

[Email to Mack - I've seen the Light]
Hey, Mack. Is this the kind of mail you want? Man, there really are some perverted freaks in Kamurocho. But I was able to unlock a new technique from his movements they were almost a work of art. It's a revelation!

You learned the Essence of Triple Strike.

Mack: Wowee, Akiyama-san! You really did it! I think I'm ready to let my photographic prodigy out in the wild. *sniffle* Guess that means ol' Mack is an empty nester again.

Akiyama: ...There, there, big guy. I'll text you whenever I find a new shot, okay? It'll be like I never left. Anyway, think you can tell me about those guys you were talking about before?

Mack: Oh, right! It totally slipped my mind! I saw them clamber down the stairs and out onto Tenkaichi Street, but I lost 'em right after that. Hard to see through all the buildings, y'know.

Akiyama: Tenkaichi Street, got it. That's not much of a lead... but at least it's something. Thanks for the info, Mack.

Mack: You got it, Akiyama-san! May your humble camera lead you to unforgettable discoveries!

[Akiyama goes on the street.]

Akiyama: (I need to find Kido-chan and our client registry, but I have no idea where that Midorikawa guy went... Better start asking around.) Excuse me, miss? You didn't happen to see some shady-looking guys roll through here a while ago, did you? I'm talking yakuza types.

Businesswoman: Oh, I did! I'm pretty sure they were headed towards Theater Square.

Akiyama: Really? Thanks!

Businesswoman: Of course. Good luck...

Akiyama: Sorry to bother you, miss, but have you seen anyone who looks like yakuza around here lately? It would've been a group of them.

Woman: Yakuza? As a matter of fact, I just saw some men like that over in Theater Square! They were humongous! Nobody in their right mind would go anywhere near those brutes.

Akiyama: Huh. Guess I'm not in my right mind, then. Anyway, thanks.

Woman: Please be careful!

Akiyama: Sorry, mind if I ask you a question? Did you see any yakuza-looking guys around here?

Businessman: Oh, all the time. This is Kamurocho we're talking about here. Why, did something happen?

Akiyama: Yeah, they nabbed a friend of mine.

Businessman: What!? That's terrible! Now that you mention it, I did see an especially conspicuous group pass by a few hours ago.

Akiyama: What!?

Businessman: Definitely yakuza, by the look of them. They were dragging some poor guy behind them, too. Pretty roughed up.

Akiyama: Where did they go?

Businessman: Past the lockers where the underground mall used to be.

Akiyama: Okay, I'll go take a look. Thanks.

[He approaches three menacing looking guys.]

Akiyama: Excuse me, fellas. Mind if I have a word?

Beefy Thug: Huh? The hell do you want?

Akiyama: You wouldn't happen to be the strapping young men who paid Sky Finance a little visit earlier, would you?

Beefy Thug: What the? How do you know about that!?

Kobayashi: Yo, sorry I'm late. Hold up. What're you doing here, Akiyama!?

Akiyama: Hm? Hey, didn't I kick your ass the other day? You're that guy from Kamurocho Loans... Kobayashi, was it?

Kobayashi: Damn right. I still owe you for that. Funny, me and my friend here were just talking about smashing Sky Finance into the ground. But if you're here, we can cut out the middleman and just smash you instead!

Ito: Yeah! We're gonna teach you a lesson for messin' with us!

Takahashi: You hear that? This is the Akiyama asshole we were telling you about. Fuck him up real good!

Beefy Thug: Akiyama, yeah? Look, it's nothing personal, man. These guys are paying me to kick your ass, so I'm gonna have to kick your ass.

Akiyama: *sigh* Here we go again.

[He kicks their asses.]

Beefy Thug: What the hell, Kobayashi? You didn't tell me he was some kinda freak! I'm gonna have nightmares about those feet, man! This is some real shit, dude! I'm outta here!

Kobayashi: Shit...

Akiyama: Why go through all this trouble? I thought I told you to stay out of my way. I mean, it can't be good for someone in your line of work to look like a wimp, and half the town just saw you get your asses handed to you. Won't be long before word gets out. I can guarantee you no one's going to be afraid of a bunch of toothless loan sharks.

Kobayashi: Dammit...

Akiyama: Tell you what. You guys leave town right now, and I'll let you off the hook.

Ito: He's right. We're not gonna get any more customers here. We can start fresh somewhere else.

Takahashi: Yeah, sounds good. I'm sick of this Kamurocho shit anyways. Whaddya say, Kobayashi-chan?

Kobayashi: …All right, fine. Okay, Akiyama-san, we'll leave. But mark my words: we're comin' back to Kamurocho someday. And when we do, we're gonna be big! So big, we'll make you look like just another no-name street punk! Just you wait!

Akiyama: You know where to find me.

Kobayashi: Oh, and here's a tip for you... I saw some yakuza pricks roll through here a little while ago.

Akiyama: What?

Kobayashi: Yeah, and one of 'em was pretty banged up, too. Heard 'em say somethin' about Sky Finance, which obviously got my attention.

Akiyama: Any idea where they went?

Kobayashi: Down below the theater. You can get there by goin' past the lockers.

Akiyama: Okay, thanks for the tip.

Kobayashi: ...See ya 'round, Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: (Looks like Midorikawa and his boys got to the Theater Underground by heading past the coin lockers. I better hurry.)

[He goes down to the underground shopping center. By the escalator he finds some homeless people.]

Akiyama: Hey, pal. You see some yakuza come through here?

Homeless Man: Oh, you bet. Those Hatsushiba punks.

Akiyama: I knew it. Listen, I need to get by.

Homeless Man: Sorry, no can do.

Akiyama: Why not?

Homeless Man: The Hatsushiba boys locked the door down below after they passed through. And lemme tell ya, that door ain't nothing if not sturdy.

Akiyama: Dammit... What now?

Homeless Man: Hold your horses. We can't stand those jerks, so we'll give you whatever help we can. The tunnels here connect with the basement levels of the Millennium Tower. All you gotta do is find the elevator at the back of the tower and you're golden. That'll take you right down where you need to go.

Akiyama: Perfect, thanks.

Homeless Man: That was our home before those Hatsushiba snots booted us out. If you help us return the favor, we can finally get it back.

Akiyama: Oh yeah? Well, no guarantees, but I'll see what I can wrangle.

[He finds the door.]

Akiyama: (This is my way down to the theater underground. Well, time to get going.)

[He is met by a handful of Hatsushiba Thugs.]

Hatsushiba Clan: Hey, who the hell’re you!?

Akiyama: Name's Akiyama, from Sky Finance. Always a pleasure.

Hatsushiba Clan: Sky Finance? What's a loan shark like you doin' here?

Akiyama: Look, I don't mean to offend, but I couldn't care less about punks like you. Midorikawa. Where is he?

Hatsushiba Clan: Huh? Whaddya want with the boss?

Akiyama: No one borrows anything from me without a contract.

Hatsushiba Clan: The fuck're you talking about!?

Akiyama: I don't have time for this. You have something that belongs to me. You're going to give me my registry back and let Kido-chan go or else,

Hatsushiba Clan: Like hell we are! How 'bout we bash your damn skull in instead!?

Akiyama: Trust me, it'll be a whole lot easier if you just return what you borrowed... but suit yourself. Guess it's just one of those days.

[He mops the dirty floor with their faces and moves on. A homeless man with an empty bottle in his hands attacks him from around the corner. Akiyama dodges the blow.]

Akiyama: Whoa!

Homeless Man: This place is ours! Yakuza ain't welcome!

Akiyama: Relax, pal. I'm no yakuza... I'm a moneylender. One who has business with Midorikawa, the guy who's been hanging out down here.

Homeless Man: Oh... Sorry about that. This place used to be our home until the Hatsushiba came along and kicked us onto the curb. There was some kinda ruckus going on, so my buddy and I figured we'd try and take the place back while they were distracted. He ended up just chickening out, though… Guess that ruckus is you, then?

Akiyama: I was hoping to settle things peacefully, but that doesn't seem to be working out too well. I suggest you get out while you still can. I can take it from here.

Homeless Man: No way! I'm tagging along whether you like it or not!

Akiyama: Don't be ridiculous. It's not safe for you here!

Sukegawa: I'm not gonna let you push me around like some senile old fool! The name's Kogoro Sukegawa, and I'm going to punish those yakuza bastards for everything they've done!

Akiyama: Uh...

Sukegawa: Before those thugs showed up, this was practically a homeless paradise. The closest thing most of us have ever had to a real home. A real family. But they had to go and ruin it! Not like some fancy-pants rich boy would understand how it feels... *sniffle*

Akiyama: ...All right. You can come with if you want.

Sukegawa: Really!? Wow, thanks, pal! Just stand back and let ol Kogoro show you how it's done!

Akiyama: Knock yourself out.

[They're teaming up to kick asses!!!!]

Akiyama: Hey there, friends. You wouldn't happen to know where I could find a Hatsushiba-san, would you?

Sukegawa: Give us back our home, you filth!

Yakuza: Ugh, first the old geezer upstairs, now this? Guess the only way to shut you up is to kill you!

Akiyama: Hm? Ah, crap... He locked the door before he ran off.

Sukegawa: Hrmmm. Oh, I know! My buddy Kakuda should still be around here somewhere. He used to be a locksmith. A door like this'd be a cinch for him. The only problem is, he's a real yellowbelly. A coward. He's probably hiding somewhere around here, waiting for all this to blow over.

Akiyama: Guess we'd better go find him, then. Come on. Uh... This him?

Sukegawa: So this is where you've been holed up. What gives, Kaku-san!?

Kakuda: Suke-san, you scared the shit outta me! Almost literally!

Sukegawa: Hey, no complaining! You were supposed to help me fight these punks, remember!?

Kakuda: But... I'm so scared! I talk a big game, but I practically piss myself when the punches actually start flying.

Sukegawa: Thankfully, we don't need you to fight. Now come on, you're coming with us!

Akiyama: There's a door we need you to open.

Kakuda: Oh, that's it? Okay... But make sure you clear everyone out before you call me over! The last thing I need is a dirty pair of underwear to distract me from my lockpicking.

Akiyama: Should be safe for your pal Kakuda now.

Sukegawa: You got that right! Those creeps were no match for us! Anyway, I'll go get Kaku-san! Be back in a jiff!

Akiyama: Think you can open this one, Kaku-san?

Kakuda: Hmm, let me see… ...Ah, it's one of these. Yeah, this shouldn't be a problem. And there you have it.

Akiyama: Very nice. Thanks! 

[Moving on they find another closed door.]

Akiyama: Not another one... Time for Kaku-san to work his magic. Think you can open this one, too, Kaku-san?

Kakuda: All right, gimme a sec… Voilà.

Akiyama: Thanks, Kaku-san.

[And another one!]

Akiyama: *sigh* Hey, Kaku-san! What about this one, Kaku-san?

Kakuda: On it… ...There you go.

Akiyama: Thanks.

[When they open the door... we see a Japanese Doc Brown working on some kind of machine, reminiscent of the machine from the original Total Recall. The thugs are kicking the machine hard, apparently wanting to destroy it.]

Yakuza: The hell you doin' down here, gramps!?

Minamida: Stop! What are you doing to my precious machine!?

Yakuza: What do you care about a broke-down piece of junk? Now get the hell outta here! This is our turf!

Sukegawa: Doctor Minamida, you've come back, too!?

Minamida: Sukegawa-san! Perfect timing!

Kakuda: The doc used to help us out back when we lived down here. Mind giving us a hand?

Akiyama: Sure... What's one more fight? Hey, buddy. I'm tagging in for the old guy. Hatsushiba-san's waiting for me, so let's make this quick, all right?

Yakuza: Cocky little shit, ain't ya? All right, fine! I'll kill you, then go to work on your dipshit little friends!

[Akiyama smashes their faces against Dr. Minamida’s machine.]

Minamida: Hm... My machine might come in handy if I can actually fix the darn thing! You're a real lifesaver, by the way. Thank you!

Akiyama: Glad I could help. That's some machine you have there.

Minamida: You want to know about my machine? Oh, I'm so glad you asked! This is the IF7-R, a creation of mine that allows you to relive your—

Akiyama: Hey, I actually don't have that much time to chat right now. As for you...

Yakuza: Shit...

Akiyama: I take it Hatsushiba-san's somewhere up ahead?

Yakuza: Damn right he is. It's not gonna be the cakewalk you're expecting, though. He's gonna wreck your scrawny ass.

Akiyama: Sorry, Suke-san, but I'll be going it alone from here.

Sukegawa: Hey, I get it. You were a big help. Just be careful, you hear?

Akiyama: I will, thanks. Okay, Kaku-san, one more door.

Kakuda: Sure thing.

Akiyama: Thanks. See you guys later.

[He walks into Hatsushiba Clan HQ.]

Akiyama: Kido-chan!

Kido: Akiyama-san...!

Midorikawa: Hey, you're good. Real dedication to the job...

Akiyama: Midorikawa-san, I presume? And I take it that's the Hatsushiba Clan chairman? I don't know what you want with Kido-chan and my registry, but what do you say you give them back?

Midorikawa: You heard the man, boss. What's it gonna be?

Hatsushiba: Heheheh... Akiyama, was it? I'm afraid you've got the wrong idea.

Akiyama: Oh, yeah? How you figure?

Hatsushiba: You didn't lend us shit. You gave it to us. So, youse, you can't ask for it back. That'd be just plain rude.

Akiyama: Ohhh, why didn't you just say so? If I gave it to you, that's different.

Hatsushiba: Damn straight. Glad we're seein' eye to eye.

Akiyama: Absolutely. Now I'm gonna ask you to give it back to me.

Hatsushiba: What?

Akiyama: Just playing along with your little game. Now give it back before things get ugly.

Midorikawa: Hah, this guy's a riot! You seriously think you can take us?

Akiyama: We won't know unless I try, will we?

Midorikawa: Oh, I definitely know... But hey, why not? I'll send you back to your bitch secretary in a body bag!

[Akiyama fights with Midorikawa. When Midorikawa realizes he can't beat Akiyama hand-to-hand, he pulls out a CHAINSAW. Grabbing a piece of pipe, Akiyama defends himself and eventually wins. Midorikawa fall on the floor.]

Akiyama: And stay down.

[He turns to Hatsushiba, who is quietly trying to carry away the book with the list of clients.]

Akiyama: Going somewhere?

Hatsushiba: (frightened) You know what, never mind! You can have your registry back!

Akiyama: Hm? I thought you said I gave it to you. No need to hand it over now. I'll just take it back after I smack the daylights out of you.

Hatsushiba: (falls on his knees) I'm sorry, you were right! Please don't smack me!

Akiyama: Fine. But instead, you're gonna tell me why exactly you did all this.

Hatsushiba: I was doing Shibata a favor. He wanted me to help find some bitch named Lily.

Akiyama: Did you just say Lily?

Kido: What's Shibata want with her?

Hatsushiba: Hell if I know, but he looked really pissed when he was talking about her.

Akiyama: So that's why you took my registry?

Hatsushiba: Yeah. We knew she'd come to see you. If she came as a client, you'd have her contact info in your registry.

Kido: That still doesn't explain why Shibata wants her so badly.

Akiyama: Hm...

Kido: Sorry to put you through all this, Akiyama-san...

Akiyama: Hm? Nah, don't mention it. You know I'm no good at all that sentimental crap. Besides, it's not like it's your fault. Even Hana-chan couldn't stop those guys.

Kido: Still...

Akiyama: Look, I got my registry back, and Hana-chan got off with nothing but a little bump to the head. We're good, all right?

Kido: ...Yeah. I should probably get going. Thanks again! (leaves)

Akiyama: (Phew... Another busy day. Think I'll take a breather back at the office.)

[He returns to Sky Finance.]

Akiyama: (Today's Lily-chan's last day at the club. She has to sell a total of three million in three days... I should drop by and see if she needs any pointers.)

[He goes to Elise.]

Akiyama: Hi. I'm here to give Lily-chan her last training session.

Elise Manager: Of course. Feel free to go to the back room.

Naoki: You can train your hostess between her shifts. Training allows you to improve the service stats of the hostesses, so it's important to train consistently. Looks, Smarts, and Charisma, as well as Motivation and Stress, can be affected by training. All are important factors when taking customer service into account. Some customers may pay more attention to these subtle details as opposed to what outfit she's wearing. After all, it's what's on the inside that counts! However, please be aware that excessive training will make a hostess stressed out. This can be remedied by having a hostess rest during break. Also note that repeating the same training may not be very effective. Hostesses are humans! They get bored, too! Use both coordination and training to cultivate an excellent hostess. Remember, we're aiming for the top here! Now, let's give training a try!

Akiyama: (to Lily) Let's work on your presentation. Makeup, hair, posture… All of these things send certain signals to a man.

Lily: I see. Tell me more.

Akiyama: Hmm... You still need a bit of work.

Lily: I'm sorry... I'll try harder next time.

Akiyama: (Nobody's requesting Lily-chan...) I think you should spend your downtime doing whatever you like. Relax.

Lily: Really? Thank you!

Akiyama: Did you make the most of your time? You seem pretty relaxed now.

Lily: Yes! I feel a lot better.

Akiyama: Right now, I'd like to give you some conversation tips to help you captivate the customers. Sound good?

Lily: That sounds great. I could use a little help.

Akiyama: Hmm... You still need a bit of work.

Lily: I'm sorry... I'll try harder next time.

Naoki: Great work today! I'll get in touch with you later.

Naoki: See you next time!

Akiyama: I've taught you everything I know. It's all up to you now.

Lily: Okay...

Akiyama: There's still some time until the club closes. Good luck.

Lily: Thank you.

Akiyama: The manager will contact me once he's calculated your sales. We just need to wait until then.

Lily: Okay.

Akiyama: (Well, I've done all I can do. Guess I'll go wait for the results over at Sky Finance.)

[He leaves the club and sees a young man wandering around.]

Akiyama: (Huh? What's with him? He better not be stalking my girls...) Hey! What are you doing?

Shady Man: Whoa! Uh, nothing!

Akiyama: You were sneaking a look at something.

Shady Man: Sneaking a look? No, I was just waiting for somebody.

Akiyama: For who?

Shady Man: Er—there she is!

Akiyama: Who? You mean Miki?

Shady Man: Oh, do you know her?

Akiyama: Sure. I own this place.

Shady Man: Whaaa—!?

Akiyama: And who might you be, hmm? A stalker, perhaps?

Shady Man: No, no, nothing like that. I just wanted to see her...

Akiyama: Are you one of her customers?

Shady Man: Uh-huh.

Akiyama: Why not just go into the club, then?

Shady Man: Well, the thing is...

Akiyama: What?

Shady Man: I've spent more than five million yen here over the past two years, and it looks like my money's finally run out...

Akiyama: Five million yen!?

{Five million yen is about $43,000.}

Shady Man: That's right. I was this close to winning her over, too...

Akiyama: If five million yen wasn't enough, I think it might be time to call it quits.

Shady Man: I just know I could do it if I had another million...

Akiyama: What's your name?

Taniguchi: Taniguchi.

Akiyama: I'm Akiyama. In addition to this club, I also run a loan office called Sky Finance.

Taniguchi: Yeah?

Akiyama: Look, the way things are now, you've got a snowball's chance in hell of going out with Miki.

Taniguchi: Huh?

Akiyama: Even with another million yen, unless you make some changes, you could see her ten more times and still get absolutely nowhere.

Taniguchi: Great...

Akiyama: Besides, you need more than just money to woo a woman. First, you have to work on your look. Then comes building up your own personal brand of charm.

Taniguchi: But how do I do all that?

Akiyama: Meet me in front of the Millennium Tower later. I'll give you a little advice.

Taniguchi: You'd do that for me?

Akiyama: Sure. Wouldn't be much of an owner if I didn't step in to help such a loyal customer.

Taniguchi: Thank you very much.

Akiyama: Oh, and the next time we meet, come all decked out in your lady-killer best.

Taniguchi: Lady-killer?

Akiyama: You know, the clothes you'd wear if you had the chance to go out on a date with Miki! I want to get a feel for your sense of style.

Taniguchi: Oh, er, okay... I will. I'll see you later, then. And thanks again.

[Akiyama returns to Sky Finance.]

Manager: Hello, Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: So... How'd Lily-chan do?

Manager: I just finished totaling her receipts. Let's see here... Over the three days here, she made...

Manager: ¥3,250,000.

{It is roughly $28,000.}

Akiyama: Got it. Thanks for letting me know.

Manager: I know you said she'd only be here three days… But the club would really benefit if she decided to keep working here. She has a rare talent for keeping customers happy. Business has been booming ever since she came.

Akiyama: Heheh. That's great to hear. Is Lily-chan there now? I'd like to speak with her if she is.

Manager: Certainly. One moment, please.

Lily: Hello, Lily speaking.

Akiyama: Hey, Lily-chan. I heard you did well.

Lily: Yes. And it's all thanks to you, Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: Nonsense. That's all you, Lily. Your natural talent and hard work.

Lily: But without your guidance, I'm not sure I would have passed the test. And for that, I'm incredibly grateful...

Akiyama: Happy to help. Now, about that money... I have it ready if you have time to meet.

Lily: Sure. Where should I go?

Akiyama: How's the roof of the Millennium Tower sound? We can meet there.

Lily: Okay, I'll be waiting.

Akiyama: Great. Till then.

[He takes the suitcase with the money and leaves the office.]

Akiyama: (I better hurry to the top of the Millennium Tower. Lily-chan will be waiting for me.)

====Head to the Millennium Tower==== 
Akiyama: (I'm supposed to meet Lily-chan on the roof. I can take one of the elevators inside to the top.)

[Akiyama is waiting for Lily on the roof of the Millennium Tower and smokes.]

Akiyama: Well, look who's here. Right on time. Somehow I knew you'd keep your promise.

Lily: Akiyama-san...

Akiyama: Well, here's your loan. One hundred million yen, as we agreed.

Lily: Thank you so much.

Akiyama: Er, I wouldn't open that just yet.

Lily: Huh?

Akiyama: What if the wind blew it all away? You'd have a hell of a time trying to get it back.

Lily: Oh, right. That would be awful...

Akiyama: Heh, I'm just teasing you. It's all neatly bundled up. Go ahead, take a look.

Lily: Okay.

Akiyama: Hard to believe it all fits in there, huh?

Lily: Hm?

Akiyama: That briefcase contains about a third of what the average college graduate makes his entire life. And his monthly pay is a tiny fraction of that. Strange to think how a man can struggle so much for so little.

Lily: It's true... But even that can be enough to change someone's whole life. Akiyama-san... Thank you so much.

Akiyama: My pleasure.

Lily: At first, I... I was planning to just take the money and run.

Akiyama: Yeah?

Lily: But you... You believed in me. You made me feel like it was okay to dream again. It had been so long since I'd felt that way… That's why I'm going to pay back every last yen, no matter how long it takes.

Akiyama: Yeah, about that...

Lily: ……

Akiyama: Don't worry about it.

Lily: What!?

Akiyama: No interest either, although it's not like Sky Finance charges it anyway.

Lily: I don't understand...

Akiyama: I'm not in this business for the money. Money changes people's lives. I just like to see it happen up close and personal.

Lily: Why did you choose this sort of test for me?

Akiyama: Are you sure you want to know? I don't normally tell folks the reasoning behind the tests give them.

Lily: I'm sure.

Akiyama: Well, this time around it wasn't about seeing how serious or determined you were. Truth be told, I was testing myself.

Lily: I don't understand.

Akiyama: Hmm, how do I put it? Let's just say I don't consider myself the best judge of character.

Lily: Why's that?

Akiyama: I've been betrayed a lot over the years. It'd almost be funny, if it weren't so tragic. Heheh...

Lily: That's awful...

Akiyama: But it's true. The bank I worked at set me up then cut me loose. The woman I loved walked out on me… It's been one thing after another ever since. Just the other day, a yakuza I'd been backing straight up killed a guy and disappeared. It got me wondering if I should even bother trusting anyone anymore.

Lily: Akiyama-san…

Akiyama: I guess it's all just part of the job. Still, I'd at least like to think I'm safe with the people I trust. I'm only human, you know?

Lily: So how did having me work at your club test you?

Akiyama: Because I found you alluring. Enough to make three million in three days. I wanted to see if my hunch was right. Sorry to put you through all this for something so stupid.

Lily: No, it's okay. I feel really lucky to have met you.

Akiyama: Maybe, but luck isn't something that just finds you. You have to get out there and put yourself in a position to be lucky. ...And for what it's worth, I couldn't be happier that you passed the test.

Lily: Akiyama-san...

Akiyama: Now before we part ways… There's something I need to ask you.

Lily: What is it?

Akiyama: Well, Lily-chan. Why did you kill them?

[Lily shocked!]

Akiyama: The boss of Kanemura Enterprises. That was you... Wasn't it?

Lily: No, I…

Akiyama: Same goes for the manager of Drama Queen. What was the point of it all? Your lighter tipped me off.

Lily: What?

Akiyama: You know, the one you had when you first dropped by my office. Before the test. The words "Drama Queen" were plastered on the front. And when I asked, you said you used to work there.

Lily: That's right.

Akiyama: Thing is, the place is an okama bar. Crossdressers. That goes for every last person on staff. No offense, but I don't see how you'd fit in. The question is, when did you get your hands on that lighter? It was when you murdered him, wasn't it? I noticed something on his jacket, too. A big, fat Shibata crest. At first I chalked it up to family violence, but I was dead wrong. And when those Shibata guys jumped us during our date… They weren't after me at all. They wanted you. Just who are you? What's your beef with the Shibata Family?

Lily: Akiyama-san. You said as long as I answered your question, I wouldn't have to pay off the loan, right?

Akiyama: Yup. Meant it, too.

Lily: Then, even if it takes a lifetime… I'll get you your money.

Akiyama: Why am I not surprised? Somehow I knew you wouldn't tell me.

Lily: I'm sorry.

Akiyama: So, you skipping town?

Lily: Yes. There's something important I need to take care of.

Akiyama: Right. Looks like we won't be seeing each other for a while, then.

Lily: No.

Akiyama: So be it. But when you're back, promise me you'll swing by. The money can wait until then.

Lily: Of course.

Akiyama: Good. I'm looking forward to the day already.

[Lily bows and walks away. Akiyama smokes and looks at the towson a little when returns to the streets of Kamurocho. His phone rings.]

Akiyama: Ah, Hana-chan. Everything okay?

Hana: I'm still waiting for some test results, but everything looks good so far. They'll probably release me soon.

Akiyama: That's great news. I have some good news of my own. I found Kido-chan and got our registry back.

Hana: Really!? You did!? Way to go, Chief!

Akiyama: You take care, all right? I'll talk to you later. (Okay, I should probably head back to Sky Finance.)

[He gets another call on the way.]

Elise Manager: There's a matter that needs discussion, sir. Would you mind coming by the club to talk?

Akiyama: Sure. What's wrong?

Elise Manager: Well... It's about the club's finances. I'm afraid if I don't ask for your help, the club may be in danger of going under.

Akiyama: Really? Well, we want to avoid that... Okay. I'll be there soon.

Elise Manager: Good. I'll be here.

Akiyama: See you there.

[He returns to Sky Finance.]

Hana: Oh, Chief. Welcome back.

Akiyama: Hey, Hana-chan. Glad to see you're doing better. You really shouldn't mess with people like that.

Hana: Don't you worry, boss. It'll never happen again. Not after all the self-defense training I've got planned!

Akiyama: ……

Hana: So, what happened with that lady who came here for the one hundred million?

Akiyama: What, Lily-chan?

Hana: Please tell me you didn't loan her the whole thing at once.

Akiyama: Actually, I did. Just now.

Hana: What!?

Akiyama: Yeah, funny thing, really. And, er... don't be mad, but somehow I don't think we'll be seeing that money again.

Hana: What!? What's that supposed to mean!?

Akiyama: I dunno. Lily-chan told me she'd pay it back, but I get the feeling that's not gonna happen.

Hana: And you lent it to her anyway!?

Akiyama: Pretty much.

Hana: What's wrong with you!?

Akiyama: What's the big deal? Last I checked, this was my company. I can lend money to who I want, when I want.

Hana: Chief...

Akiyama: Besides, this is hardly the first time this sort of thing's happened. Why make a fuss about it now? What do you have against Lily-chan? Hana-chan? What's wrong?

Hana: Grr... That's it! I quit!

[Hana runs out of the office.]

Akiyama: Huh? (Well, that's not good. I need to get after her, fast.)

[He chases Hana and catches up with her at the park.]

Hana: *pant* *pant*

Akiyama: So, are you going to tell me what's wrong or not?

Hana: I don't get it, Chief... * pant* Why are you going out of your way for this Lily-san?

Akiyama: ...Huh?

Hana: I don't care if you're the owner. Lending that much to a total stranger is just plain crazy!

Akiyama: Come on, Hana-chan. She passed my test, so I gave her the loan. Same rules I hold everyone to.

Hana: Don't lie to me, Chief! I know the real reason you did it.

Akiyama: What?

Hana: It's because she reminds you of Eri-san! Don't try to deny it!

Akiyama: Hana-chan, please. It's not like that. Just hear me out. ...Say what you need to say.

Akiyama: It's true, I was pretty blown away at first. I mean, it's not every day the splitting image of your ex comes walking through your office door.

Hana: Uh-huh...

Akiyama: And I won't deny that I have feelings for Lily-chan. Pretty face, great personality, an air of mystery... She's got the whole nine yards. But that's not why I gave her the loan. You know I wouldn't do that.

Hana: Still...

Akiyama: You don't believe me, do you?

Hana: No, it's just... I already knew all that. And it doesn't change the fact that I'm mad at you!

Akiyama: Come on, Hana-chan.

Hana: Don't you "Hana-chan" me! What are you doing dragging all that baggage around!? Eri-san's never coming back! Why can't you accept that? Or did you forget how she left you for another man the minute you got fired? It was never about you, Chief. She was only in it for the money.

Akiyama: Leave Eri out of this!

Hana: Chief, I...

Akiyama: Don't. Hearing you talk about her like that only makes it worse.

Hana: But...

Akiyama: You're right, Hana-chan. I've got a lot of baggage weighing me down. I had honestly thought I could get rid of it all, live free... but I guess there are some things I just can't let go of.

Hana: ……

Akiyama: That's just who I am... and I don't think that's ever gonna change.

Hana: Someone as stubborn as you? Not a chance.

Akiyama: Heh, yeah. Sorry.

Hana: That doesn't mean I'm going to just magically forgive you.

Akiyama: No, guess not. Do I get credit for at least trying?

Hana: ...Chief.

Akiyama: ……

Hana: I'm still quitting.

Akiyama: Hana-chan...

Hana: Today made me realize our relationship is a little too codependent. I've been with you eight years now, ever since your banking days. I've always admired you, Akiyama-san... but I think I need some space. There's a lot I still have to figure out. About my future in the industry. About my feelings for you.

Akiyama: But...

Hana: No buts. You've done so much for me over the years, and I know it won't be easy for you being on your own... but you'll be okay. I'm sure of it.

Akiyama: Hana-chan, wait.

Hana: Goodbye, Akiyama-san.

[She leaves. Akiyama’s phone rings.]

Manager: Akiyama-san! Thank goodness! Some seriously shady customers just showed up. They look like yakuza.

Akiyama: So? We get people like that all the time.

Manager: Yes, but there's more… Apparently, they know Lily-san, and they keep asking to see her. They're starting to make a scene...

Akiyama: Lily-san....? That could be a problem....

Manager: Yes, sir. Normally, I'd handle this myself, but they came in a big group.

Akiyama: Okay, hang tight. I'll be right over.

Manager: Sorry about all this. Please hurry.

Akiyama: (Running a hostess club can be a real pain sometimes. I better get over to Elise.)

[Akiyama walks into a bar and hears someone singing... The singer turns out to be a half-naked young yakuza with a tattoo of a skull with a snake.]

Young Yakuza: (singing) Cradled gently by the evening's embrace… Tears rolling down my sullen face. The dancing snow flutters soft to the ground… The whitest of whites even in this dirty town. Flowers, they bloom. Petals, they fall. Your beauty, sees me through it all.

[His goons applaud.]

Yakuza: (notices Akiyama) Who's the suit?

Akiyama: The guy who owns this club. Name's Akiyama. And you are?

Yakuza: One o' Majima's boys. Ya can call me Minami.

[DAISAKU MINAMI of the Majima Family, a Tojo Clan Subsidiary.]

Akiyama: The Majima Family? You mean the guys building Kamurocho Hills? Led by the Tojo legend?

Minami: Ding ding ding. (hears some music) The one and only. Hang on a sec. This number right here's my jam. Y'all ready!? I can't hear ya!

[Akiyama turns the karaoke off.]

Minami: Hm? What the? Hellooo? The fuck you do that for!?

[He throws the microphone at Akiyama, but he easily dodges it.]

Akiyama: My bad. I thought I was pressing the send button. Must've accidentally hit cancel instead. Honest mistake. It's too darn dark in here, huh?

Minami: Ya pushed the wrong button 'cause it's too dark? You're not tryin' to pull a quick one on me, are ya? Huh. No biggie, then. Shit happens.

[He tries to turn the karaoke on.]

Akiyama: Um… Minami-san, was it?

Minami: What now?

Akiyama: Well, er. To what do I owe this visit?

Minami: Oh yeah, glad ya asked! Heard there's some broad Lily workin' here. Rumor has it she's a real beaut. Figured I should witness that glory with my own two peepers.

Akiyama: Lily, hm? My deepest apologies, but today was her last day here.

Minami: Say what!? Well, ain't that a kick in the dick.

Akiyama: Was there a particular reason you wanted to see her?

Minami: Fuck if I know. Only thing the big man said was to haul her tail end back to HQ.

Akiyama: The big man? You mean Majima-san?

Minami: Who else? Now ya better get talkin' friend. Where'd this Lily girl scamper off to?

Akiyama: Apologies, sir. I'm sure you have your reasons, ut we take employee privacy very seriously here. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

Minami: Ya what!?

Akiyama: I'm not in the business of selling out my girls. Even the ones who aren't with us anymore.

MInami: Well, look at mister hero over here.

Akiyama: Guilty as charged. What good is an owner if they don't protect their workers?

Minami: You're a real barrel of monkeys, pal. But ya should know, I ain't playin'. Yakuza don't like uppin' and leavin' empty-handed.

Akiyama: You, want money, then?

Minami: Man fuck your money! Until you tell me where the bitch ran off to, I ain't movin' one inch. If you won't leave on your own, I guess I'll have to show you out myself. (bows) Last chance.

Akiyama: Heh. Big pair of marbles you got there, buddy. Too bad I'm gonna have to smash 'em like grapes!

[Akiyama prepares for the fight. Minami proves to be tough and fast, but he's no match from Akiyama.]

Manimi: Naw, man. If ya think I'm done with you now… you're dead wrong!

Akiyama: I'm impressed. What's Majima feeding you guys?

Minami: Dammit… I'm not throwin' in the towel yet. Not by a long shot!

[We hear a familiar voice!]

Majima: Enough. That rubbish you call singin' doesn't deserve the stage ya stand on.

Minami: Boss!

Akiyama: Boss? Then... you must be Patriarch Majima.

[GORO MAJIMA. Patriarch of the Majima Family, a Tojo Clan Subsidiary.]

Majima: Figure my tone-deaf friend here already told ya… But we're lookin' for a "Lily." She happen to be here?

Akiyama: Not anymore. She quit. Probably already skipped town.

Majima: Huh. Guess I'm late to the shindig, then. (walks away)

Akiyama: What do you want with her, anyway? The Shibata have had their eyes on her, too. So tell me, Majima-san. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

Majima: (sits down) Fascinatin'. The Shibata Family, huh?

Akiyama: I need to know, Majima-san. Just who is Lily, really? What's your family doing looking for her?

Majima: Simple as shit. I got a duty to keep Yasuko-chan safe.

Akiyama: Yasuko? Is that her real name? And why do you have to protect her?

Majima: Well... I gotta make amends. For fuckin' up, back in '85.

Akiyama: Amends?

Majima: Hey, man.

[PART 1 COMPLETE]

PART 2 PROLOGUE
April 20th, 1985

[A small apartment in a poor neighborhood. A large man with a tiger tattoo on his back looks out the window, but the tattoo is not the usual Yakuza tattoo. He simply has a tiger tattooed on his back. His name is Taiga Saejima. Young Yasuko is also in the apartment with him. Young Majima enters. He still has his right eye.]

{These events are also present in Yakuza 0, which had not yet been released at the time of the fourth game's release.}

Saejima: Yo.

Majima: Yo. 

Yasuko: Oh, Majima-san! What brings you by?

Majima: Eh, just figured I'd drop in. Man, we got a real scorcher out there. I'm not used to sweatin' my jewels off this time of year. It's only April! 

Saejima: Heard it's almost hittin' 90 today. Whole country's gonna be up in flames before long.

{90 degrees Fahrenheit is about 32 degrees Celsius.}

Majima: Country? Try the whole world. We're tearin' this speck of cosmic dust apart.

Saejima: Look at you soundin' all educated.

Majima: Hey, I know some stuff. Ozone layer's going to shit, too.

Saejima: Says who?

Majima: My boss.

Saejima: Shimano-han said that?

Majima: Moanin' about the environment's the hip new thing to do. Even yakuza are comin' out saying we gotta take care of the planet.

Saejima: Morons.

[Majima pulls out a whole watermelon. These things are quite expensive in Japan!]

Majima: Here.

Yasuko: A watermelon!

Majima: Right on. Perfect refresher on a blazin' day like this.

Yasuko: I didn't realize they sold them this big so early in the spring!

Majima: Not for cheap, they don't. But I don't think we're gonna be eatin' stuff like this where we're goin'. Call it an early celebration.

Yasuko: Celebrating what?

Saejima: Yasuko. Ain't every day Majima drops by. Mind grabbin' us a few beers? (gives her some change)

Yasuko: Not at all. Be back soon! You guys want snacks, too?

Saejima: Yeah, sounds good.

Yasuko: Got it. (leaves)

Majima: (getting serious) So. You're keepin' Yasuko-chan in the dark.

Saejima: Don't got much choice. Not gonna just up and say we're offin' a bunch of guys tomorrow.

Majima: Ya don't gotta put it like that. Just tell her we'll be gone on business for a while. At least say goodbye. Ya owe her that much.

Saejima: Hell with that. It's bad luck. Speakin' of, though. You bring 'em?

Majima: Sure did.

[Majima sets the watermelon aside and puts the suitcase on the table. When he opens it we see that inside are six revolvers and a box of ammunition.]

{Personally, the revolvers reminded me of the Smith & Wesson LadySmith .38}

Majima: These babies are the real deal. Come checked and certified straight from the Dojima Family. Six handguns. Each one with six rounds. Makin' for 36 slugs total.

Saejima: 36, huh?

Majima: Should be enough for Yoshiharu Ueno. And whatever Seiwa Clan thugs he's got with him.

Saejima: How many we figurin’?

Majima: Single digits. Ten max.

Saejima: So we got three, maybe four shots a man. I'll take it.

Majima: Listen, bro. If you want out, now's the time. It's two on ten. Ugly odds even with the element of surprise. And say we do pull it off... That's ten years, minimum. Could be for life. We might even hang for it. Me? I'm a lone wolf. I've been ready to die for this since the day I called Shimano my boss. But you? You've got Yasuko-chan. Saejima. You sure you can just leave her behind like that?

Saejima: Bro. You're lettin' your Kansai accent slip.

Majima: Come on, I'm being serious here!

Saejima: My decision's made. You'd die for your boss, yeah? Then no shit I'm ready to do the same for Sasai. And…

Majima: And what?

Saejima: I gotta know, brother. Just how far Taiga Saejima can climb up the Tojo Clan totem pole. Ya get me?

Majima: Saejima...

[And then the day comes. It's raining outside. Taiga looks at his watch, waiting for Majima.]

Saejima: Where the fuck are ya, bro? Late-ass...

[He leaves the car and walks to a phone on the street.]

Saejima: It's me. Saejima, Sasai Family. Majima was s'posed to be here by now. What's holdin' him up? Yup. I’ll be—

[A couple of cars drive in.]

Saejima: They're here. Never mind, I'm good. Later.

[About twenty yakuza get out of their cars.]

Saejima: Goddamn. That ain't 10. That's a fuckin' army.

[Yoshiharu Ueno and Isao Katsuragi get out of the car and go to the restaurant. Taiga opens the trunk of his car and arms himself. Unable to find where to put the last revolver, he takes it in his teeth, and then slowly walks toward the restaurant. He begins methodically killing one by one. Ueno and Katsuragi sit in the farthest corner and watch in horror. Taiga, being a cross between Kratos and John Wick, mercilessly kills the Yakuza.]

Yakuza: You're gonna pay for this!

Katsuragi: No! Stay back!

[Taiga shoots Katsuragi and he falls to the floor. Only a few Yakuza remain in the restaurant. Taiga kills them and stands on the table, rising like a giant over Ueno. Suddenly Katsuragi comes to his senses. He shoots Taiga in the shoulder and covers Ueno with his body.]

Katsuragi: Please… Not the boss. I swore I'd protect him with my life!

[Taiga shots him. Ueno trembles in fear.]

Saejima: Sorry… But I got my orders too. Ueno-san. It's nothin' personal.

Ueno: Someone help..!

[Taiga pulls the trigger.]

PART 2: TAIGA SAEJIMA
Chapter 1: TO THE TRUTH
[On a black screen, the following text scrolls along to the suspenseful music.]

6:05 p.m., 21, 1985.

A few hours after the attack.

Taiga Saejima of the Tojo Clan's Sasai Family is arrested for murder after surrendering to the Kamurocho Police.

Police suspect the attack to be part of the feud between the powerful Tojo Clan and its adversary, the Ueno Seiwa Clan.

Executive involvement of both clans is investigated as police begin interrogation of Saejima.

However, Saejima maintains his silence throughout the interrogation. Unable to establish a direct link to the Tojo Clan, police conclude that the incident was a one-man job. Saejima is sent to the prosecutor's office.

A few months later...

20-year-old Taiga Saejima is given the death penalty for the murder of 18 members of the Ueno Seiwa Clan, and is immediately transferred to the Tokyo Penitentiary.

Decades later, on March 1, 2010...

After 25 years of awaiting his execution, Taiga Saejima is suddenly issued a transfer order...

March 3rd, 2010
2:00 PM

[Taiga is being taken in a police van, handcuffed. Several police officers are sitting next to him. The fire in Taiga's eyes went out long ago. The van arrives at another prison. The doors open.]

Guard: Out.

[Policemen take Taiga out of the van. The camera pulls back showing us a general view of the prison. There is only one road leading to it, closed on both sides with metal netting. The prison itself stands on stilts over the ocean.]

Guard: Taiga Saejima, yes?

[Taiga stands silent.]

Guard: Today marks your official transfer. im Tokyo Penitentiary to Okinawa Penitentiary No. 2. 

[The guards lead Taig to his cell. Hamazaki can be seen in one of the cells.]

Guard: Welcome to your new home. Get in.

[Taiga enters his cell.]

Guard: Hands out. (uncuffs Taiga) Dinner's at 1700. All other rules are in the papers we've provided for you. You should know, this isn't your average prison. If you want to relish the final scraps of life before your execution.. Keep your head down and follow orders.

5:00 PM
Okinawa Penitentiary No. 2 Cafeteria

Inmate: What the… Aren't you... Taiga Saejima?

Inmate (Hamazaki): Hm...

Inmate: It really is you, isn't it?

Saejima: ……

Inmate: Holy shit. Saejima, the stone-cold hitman? You're a friggin' legend! Ain't that right, fellas?

Saejima: I'm not a hitman.

Inmate: Say what?

Saejima: I said, I ain't no hitman.

Inmate: Uh, guys? What's going on here?

[Several prisoners approach Taiga.]

Inmate: Hey. You really Saejima? I asked a fucking question. You Taiga Saejima or not!?

Saejima: So what if I am?

Inmate: Then it looks like there really is a god.

[The other inmates move the tables to make room in the center.]

Inmate: This here's some goddamn divine intervention. (pulls out a shiv) You realize who we are, don't you? The Ueno Seiwa. Our boss was one of the men you murdered those twenty-five years ago. We've had you in our sights for decades now. And here you are right on our doorstep.

Saejima: So ya want a little payback for your boss.

Inmate: Nothing little about it. After the hell you put us all through, we want revenge! So we're gonna do the prison a favor. You're getting executed here and now!

[Taiga beats up the inmates. The others are in shock and awe.]

Saejima: Listen. Your life's in the crapper, sure. But don't blame your dead boss for that. A real yakuza owns up to his shit. So if you wanna blame someone, try lookin' in a mirror.

[The guards run in.]

Guard: What's going on in there!?

[The guards drag Taiga into solitary confinement and beat him with a truncheon.]

Guard: Not such a big man now, are you?

[Taiga looks at him with hate and rage.]

Guard: Don't give me that look. You want more!?

[He continues to beat Taiga even as his partner enters.]

Guard 2: Hey, Saito. Listen to me, Saito. Saito! That's enough.

Saito: Goddamn. He's a freak of nature! Not one who's scheduled for execution today. Lay off him.

[Guard 3 releases Taiga and he falls to the floor.]

Saito: What for? Who cares if he lives or dies? Nobody's gonna miss this human trash.

Guard 2: That would make three prisoners who have died under your watch. You can't keep doing this.

Saito: (throws the truncheon) Fuck off! It's your lucky day, freak. (he and Guard 3 leaves)

Guard 2: You've got a visitor.

[Hamazaki approaches the cell.]

Guard 2: (to Hamazaki) This little favor'll cost you.

Hamazaki: I got friends on the outside. they'd be glad to slip a cool mil into your account. That enough for you?

Guard 2: I'll take it. I was just thinking of getting a nice new car, too. Thanks for the help. Now, clock's ticking. Tick, tock. (leaves)

Inmate (Hamazaki): You okay? That asshole whooped you good.

Saejima: ……Who's askin’?

Hamazaki: Name's Hamazaki. Tojo Clan, same as you. I was one of the big boys till I wound up here last year. Had my own family and everything.

Saejima: That so.

Hamazaki: Didn't think I'd meet a living legend in this hellhole. 18 kills in one go is a hard feat to forget.

Saejima: What's your game?

Hamazaki: Not sure what you mean.

Saejima: The guards ain't gonna be too thrilled about this. Outside of the one ya just paid off, I mean. And this place has got more'n its share of psychos. Can't imagine they'd be happy knowin' ya came by to see me.

Hamazaki: Heh. You don't know a goddamn thing about where you are, do you? This is no ordinary prison, friend.

Saejima: How's that?

Hamazaki: Lemme ask you a question. You know what this place is called? 

Saejima: Yeah, Okinawa Penitentiary No. 2.

Hamazaki: Good. The thing about that is, though... no penitentiary by that name officially exists. Not in Okinawa, not in Japan, not anywhere.

Saejima: Yeah, sure. Like I'm fallin' for that.

Hamazaki: It's the truth. You look on the map, and all you'll see is some nameless correctional facility. Nothing out of the ordinary. When in fact it's a privately funded high-security prison built under government contract.

Saejima: And nobody raises an eyebrow or nothin'?

Hamazaki: Why would they? On paper, this place is just like any other correctional facility. An easy, humanitarian way of dealing with the rising prison population. But the truth lurking under the surface is damn sinister. The only reason it exists is to make yakuza like us disappear, no questions asked.

Saejima: Whaddya mean, disappear?

Hamazaki: Pretty sure you can guess. That corrections officer who was laying into you's buried a few guys just the last month or so. Takes 'em in here and beats them to death.

Saejima: In this room, huh?

Hamazaki: Yup. Not a pretty sight once he's done, I'll tell you that. Worst part is, they don't even own up to it. Official cause of death always ends up "illness" or some other random bullshit. Remember, this place was built for the worst of the worst. You die in here, not a damn soul's gonna bother asking why.

Saejima: That's goddamn insane.

Hamazaki: But it's the truth. Good news is, it goes both ways. Most of the guards in here are more than corrupt enough to take a bribe or two. Makes life a little easier for me, at least.

Saejima: ....So what's all this got to do with me? You dropped a mil to get to me. Well, here I am. Spit it out already!

Hamazaki: ...I need your help with something.

The Next Day
March 4th, 1:00 PM

[Prisoners rest in the open air. Taiga sits silently on the bench. One of the prisoners secretly hands Hamazaki a key. Hamazaki walks to Taiga and gives the key to him.]

Hamazaki: As promised. Had a buddy copy one for you. Guy was a pro before he got tossed in here. That cell won't keep you cooped up anymore.

Saejima: Still didn't say I'd do it.

Hamazaki: No problem there. You'll do it. You don't have a choice.

Last night,
In Solitary Confinement…

Saejima: (screams) The fuck did you say? 

[He pushes Hamazaki against the wall.]

Saejima: The Ueno Seiwa's still alive and kickin’!?

Hamazaki: Yeah, you heard me. They've got turf right in the heart of Tokyo. And they're still growing!

Saejima: Ya think you can feed me this shit 'cause I been in the slammer? Well I ain't fallin' for it, asshole!

Hamazaki: I'm telling the truth! Not just that, but the Ueno are real tight with the Tojo Clan. They swore an oath right after your little episode back in '85!

[Saejima releases Hamazaki and falls to his knees.]

Saejima: What kinda bullshit is that? 

Hamazaki: You didn't actually kill Yoshiharu Ueno. Still, the Ueno Seiwa were reeling hard after the haymaker you gave 'em. But they pulled through, just like their boss.

Saejima: How?

Hamazaki: Good question. Turns out you got your boss to thank for that.

Saejima: The boss?

Hamazaki: After that rampage you went on… Old man Sasai ended up shouldering the blame. Stepped down and everything. But let's say he hadn't, hypothetically speaking. The Sasai would probably be one of the Tojo top dogs by now.

Saejima: Why…? Why'd he do it?

Hamazaki: Beats me. Any chance of knowing the truth disappeared the same time Sasai did. With their head honcho gone, his family crumbled. And who rose from the ashes? None other than the Shibata Family.

Saejima: Shibata, huh?

Hamazaki: Yup. Same guys who were competing with you to woo the Tojo. Turns out they won. In the end, that hit only got rid of two things. Old man Sasai, and you. Everyone else has kept going like it never even happened. I get how you're feeling, Saejima-san. This is tough shit to hear. You've got more honor than a thousand yakuza. Sure, you might've "failed," but you alone offed eighteen of the enemy's best men in the process. You're practically a Tojo folk hero, Saejima-san. But, oh. There's more to it than that. Something extra spicy about that afternoon in '85. That day, you were supposed to meet a brother. Take out the Ueno together. But he never showed. Spot on, right? Truth of the matter is… Every bit of that went exactly according to plan.

[Taiga grinds his teeth in rage. Back to the next day…]

Hamazaki: So. The reality of it all soak in yet?

Saejima: ……

Hamazaki: Look, I get it. Shit stings, knowing your own brother went and stabbed you in the back.

Saejima: ……

Hamazaki: But now that you know the truth, I don't imagine you'll be happy just sitting in here nice and quiet till it's your day to hang. That snake in the grass Majima's been living the high life, throwing his weight around Kamurocho like he's the king of the damn world. While you're rotting away in this hellhole, stuck shoving down some of the worst slop known to man just to survive. If that's not the textbook definition of "fucked over," I don't know what is.

Saejima: ……

Hamazaki: Way I see it, you've only got one shot at settling the score. But you're never gonna do that if you don't get out of here. 

[A map appears on the screen.]

Hamazaki: We'll make our escape tonight at one o'clock, while everyone's sound asleep. I'll get out of my cell using one of the two keys I had made. You do the same with the other. I'll wait by the entrance till you're out. Next step is all you. Once you're ready, throw your bed down over the rail to distract the guards. They'll be on your ass in an instant, so just keep 'em busy while slip behind and head for the warden's office. We'll meet there once you're done dealing with the guards.

Saejima: At the warden's office? Why there?

Hamazaki: There's something there I'm gonna need once we're on the outside. But don't worry about that.

Saejima: ...Right.

Hamazaki: After we reconvene, we book it across the yard over to the far wall. The one with the guard tower. Once we make our way up with a grappling hook, we'll be home free.

Saejima: A grapplin' hook? How the hell’d ya get a hold of somethin' like that?

Hamazaki: I haven't. Not yet.

Saejima: What?

Hamazaki: That's where you come in.

Saejima: ...Keep talkin'.

Hamazaki: Your job's to find something we can use as a rope, and some kinda hook to go with it.

Saejima: Yeah? And how're ya expectin' me to do that?

Hamazaki: We get all kinds of interesting folks in here. And those interesting folks smuggle in all sorts of interesting stuff. Weapons, food, you name it.

Saejima: So what, ya want me to barter?

Hamazaki: More or less. There's one guy in particular who'll really get things moving. Take a look. Poor bastard had a booming business down here in Okinawa. Got caught up in a yakuza shitstorm, though. Ended up busted for illegal arms manufacturing. Lucky for us, his skills got him in good with the guards. They even let him set up a little workshop in here. Long as he's got the materials, he can make damn near anything. All you gotta do is get him what he needs. Anyway, lemme know once you've got that grappling hook. Better hurry, though. Daylight's fading fast.

====Get Ready for the Jailbreak====
[Taiga walks to a guy familiar to us from Yakuza 3.]

Saejima: Hey, got a sec?

Kamiyama: Oh, uh, sure. You're the one they hauled in yesterday, right?

Saejima: Yup. Heard you're good with your hands.

Kamiyama: That's right, sir. I made a name for myself on these islands as, well... Let's just say I'm a craftsman of sorts. Or at least I was, until I got thrown in here.

Saejima: What's a regular ol' citizen doing gettin' dumped in one of the highest security prisons in the country?

Kamiyama: I suppose I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I was minding my own business, doing business with some fine gentlemen who... turned out to be yakuza. When the police showed up for them, they took me in, too. Once they started looking into my livelihood, though, they figured out I was involved in some, uh, less than legal activities.

Saejima: Folks in my line of work call those crimes. What kind we talkin?

Kamiyama: Well, um... I made, modded, bought, and sold all kinds of deadly weapons.

Saejima: Oh.

Kamiyama: I never hurt a soul, though! No siree! Er, not directly, anyway. Not to mention the fact I got forced into the business to start with...

Saejima: Ya don't say. Well, whatever your story, I got a favor to ask. Gonna need ya to make a grapplin' hook for me. Think ya can manage that?

Kamiyama: Anything's possible as long as I have the materials. May I ask why?

Saejima: Ya can ask, but I ain't tellin'. You'll be better off not knowin', anyhow.

Kamiyama: I, uh... All right, then. Do you need it to be especially sturdy?

Saejima: Sturdy enough to hold a person or two.

Kamiyama: I... see. Well, all right. No more questions from me, then! Just bring me a nice, thick chain and that grappling hook should be a cinch. Fortunately for you, I saw one of the inmates swinging one around the other day.

Saejima: Oh yeah?

Kamiyama: Just try to keep things civil, okay? The guards would be on you in a flash if you start trouble.

Saejima: Right, thanks.

[He walks around the yard talking to inmates.]

Ex-Tojo Yakuza: Watch out, Saejima-san. Hamazaki's taking you for the ride of the century.

Saejima: Whaddya mean?

Ex-Tojo Yakuza: I used to be in the Tojo, just like you... and lemme tell you, nothing good's gonna come from trusting that dirty two-timer. Did you know he and the Snake Flower Triad tried taking over the Tojo? Needless to say, more than a few guys in here would love nothing more than to stick a knife in his belly.

Saejima: Ya got beef with Hamazaki, take it up with him. Don't got nothin' to do with me.

Ex-Tojo Yakuza: Not sure that's true. Lemme guess, he said he's gonna help you break out? Sorry, pal, but he's gonna sell you out first chance he gets. You'll see.

Saejima: ……

Ex-Tojo Yakuza: Look, I'm just trying to warn you. Back out now before shit really hits the fan.

Prison Guard: C'mon. Slip me a couple million and I'll make it worth your while.

Yakuza Inmate: Gimme a break, man. Ya been hittin' me up for cash every month since I got tossed in this dump. I ain't made of money.

Prison Guard: What's the big deal? You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

Yakuza Inmate:Yeah, but you scratchin' my back's gonna end up bleedin' me dry... Fine. I'll get one of my pals on the outside to wire it over tomorrow.

Prison Guard: Heh, pleasure doing business. Don't worry, I'll make sure you're taken care of real good.

Jailhouse Snitch: So, what're you in for?

Saejima: Who, me?

Jailhouse Snitch: You see anyone else around? Of course you! Must've done something big to end up in here. What was it? Arson? Assault? Grand theft auto?

Saejima: I don't gotta tell ya a damn thing. Now back off 'fore I make you back off.

Jailhouse Snitch: Eep! Pretty sure I just pissed myself a little...

Tabuse: First day in here, and you end up in the biggest fight I've seen in years. You really showed those guys what's what.

Saejima: ……

Tabuse: Guess you got what was coming to you for all that, though. In case you couldn't tell, this isn't your run-of-the-mill prison. But hey, it's not all bad behind bars. The real trick is appreciating the small stuff whenever you can. Like... see that guy smoking over there? How do you think he got that cig? As long as the guards don't have it out for you, this place can be kinda cozy. Point is, keep your nose clean if you wanna survive. You might even get some special treatment along the way.

Cigarette-starved Prisoner: Hey, you got a smoke?

Saejima: In here? You outta your damn mind?

Cigarette-starved Prisoner: Heh, guess you're new in this neck of the woods. A cigarette's the best way to make friends in here. If you don't have 'em... Well, watch your back.

Saejima: ...Huh.

Haga: See that guy in the corner?

Saejima: What about him?

Haga: Keep your guard up 'round him. Word is he's real jumpy.

Saejima: Why, someone after him?

Haga: The whole damn prison's after him! After all of us. It's no wonder he started hoardin' up body armor like there was no tomorrow. It's nice at least feelin' safe, y'know? But all it's done is paint a big ol' target on his back. Drawing attention's the best way to speed up your execution date. Better to keep a low profile.

Hungry Inmate: What do you think's on the menu tonight? I've been craving yakiniku ever since I got tossed in here. What I wouldn't do for some nice, juicy meat...

Famished Prisoner: The least they could do is feed us some Okinawa delicacies. Stewed pork, rafute... Hell, I'd even eat bitter melon before the cardboard they serve us!

Hungry Inmate: Hey, if you could only eat one meal for the rest of your life, what would it be?

Famished Prisoner: Only one? Hm... Gotta be pork cutlet curry.

Hungry Inmate: Ohhh, yeah, Shit, that sounds good right now.

Famished Prisoner: Mmm. A nice, thick cut of succulent pork, a mountain of steaming rice, all drowning in rich, kinda sweet curry... Ugh, I gotta get out of here. Not to rub salt in the wound, but did you know pork goes best with sweeter curries? A hint of sweet cuts through that rich pork like nothing else, man. I love stirring the rice and curry together, scarfing down a big spoonful, then taking a quick bite of the pork so they all mix in my mouth. Pissed the missus off to high heaven.

Hungry Inmate: God damn, just hearing you talk about it's making my mouth water. Nothing to do now but reminisce about my dine n' dash days…

Yakuza Inmate: Once they lock you up in here, there's no gettin' out.

Murderer Inmate: I dunno... I heard stories of guys getting real tight with some of the guards, then getting out on good behavior.

Yakuza Inmate: Sounds like a load of shit to me. Guards probably spread the idea so people'll come kiss their asses. Me, I don't buy it.

Murderer Inmate: Better to kiss ass and not get anything from it than rot in here without even trying. Or worse, get shivved in your sleep.

Hayashida: How'd you get that awesome chain, Kataoka-san? I'm jealous as all hell, man.

Kataoka: Remember when I was doing construction on the new cell block? I knicked it from there, no problem.

Hayashida: Shit, I gotta get one of those construction jobs! I could use myself a nice new weapon.

Saejima: (Chain, huh? Looks like I found my man.) You there. I hear ya got yourself a chain.

Kataoka: What's it to you?

Saejima: Mind lettin' me borrow it?

Kataoka: Ha! We got ourselves a joker here, boys. Weapons are the only thing that keep you alive in this hellhole. Not a chance I'm lending mine out to the first little shit that comes strolling up to me.

Saejima: ...Sorry, but I need that chain real bad. If ya ain't gonna lend it to me, I'm just gonna have to take it by force. (Better get this done before the guards come.)

[He beats the inmates with less than a minute.]

Kataoka: Shit... Here, just take it.

You "borrowed" a Chain.

Saejima: Sorry again. Nothin' personal.

Kataoka: Yeah, yeah, whatever. Look, I don't really care what you do with it, but you better give it back to me when you're done.

Saejima: I'll see what I can do.

[He returns to Kamiyama.]

Saejima: Hey, got the chain.

Kamiyama: Already? Wow, you're good. This should work quite nicely. It's, uh, pretty heavy though. You sure that's okay?

Saejima: Not gonna be a problem.

Kamiyama: If you say so. Now for the hook part of this whole arrangement... You wouldn't happen to have a pitchfork, would you?

Saejima: Uh, no.

Kamiyama: Hm... Oh, I've got it! One of the guys they put on farm duty might have something you can use. I mean, you can't farm without equipment. Think I can get by with a pitchfork or maybe even a hoe.

Saejima: (Huh. Didn't think I'd be scroungin' up farm tools for this.)

[He continues to wander around.]

Morinaga: You're like a friggin' mack truck, Kawana-san. How's a fella get that ripped?

Kawana: I'm telling you, man. It's all the work they've got me doing out in the field.

Morinaga: Shit... I gotta get myself on farm duty!

Kawana: Fat chance. You know how much I had to shell out for that privilege? Not gonna happen unless you're ready to lay down some serious cash.

Saejima: (Looks like I found my farmer.) I hear you work the farm here.

Kawana: Yeah, they let me run the roost over a little patch, seeing as I'm always on such good behavior. What's it to you?

Saejima: Got a question for ya. You use a pitchfork or a hoe over there?

Kawana: Sure do. Big or hoe, use it to turn the soil.

Saejima: Mind if I borrow it from ya? Won't be long.

Kawana: Nah, man. The guards'll lose their shit if one of the tools goes missing. Besides, it's not like I keep 'em on me all day.

Saejima: Please. I need it real bad.

Kawana: Hm... And you promise it won't be long?

Saejima: 'Course.

Kawana: Fine, then. Bring me a smoke and I'll think about it.

Saejima: Where's a guy s'posed to score a cigarette in here?

Kawana: Not the commissary, that's for damn sure. Most guys I know get 'em smuggled in from the outside. Anyway, get on it. I'll have that hoe ready by the time you scare up that smoke.

Saejima: (Guess I don't got a choice here...)

[He goes to the smoking inmate.]

Saejima: You there. Think I can bum a smoke off ya?

Ozaki: Who's asking? Wait, aren't you the new guy?

Saejima: That's me.

Ozaki: You didn't waste any time making friends back in the cafeteria. I was there. Near lost my appetite seeing the smackdown you gave those guys. Shit was vile, man.

Saejima: ...Right.

Ozaki: Damn if it wasn't entertaining, though. Shame it landed you in the hole, but hey, all good things come at a cost. Here, you deserve this after the show you put on.

You got a Cigarette.

Ozaki: You've probably realized by now, but cigarettes are practically like gold in here. You wanna loosen someone's lips, all you gotta do is pop a smoke between 'em. Anyway, be seeing you.

[Taiga returns to the farmers.]

Saejima: Here's your cigarette, man.

Kawana: Yeah? And how am I supposed to light it? No deal 'til you bring me a lighter.

Saejima: (...Great.)

[He approaches the guard.]

Prison Guard: What do you want, inmate?

Saejima: Just a drink o' water. Mind lettin' me through?

Prison Guard: Fine, but make it quick.

[There Taiga finds a lighter on the ground.]

You found a Lighter.

Prison Guard: You want to go back to the yard?

Saejima: Yeah, ya mind?

Prison Guard: Suit yourself.

Saejima: Here you go. Got your cigarette and lighter right here.

Kawana: Heh, about time.

You handed over the Cigarette.

You handed over the Lighter.

Saejima: Now let's have that hoe.

Kawana: Slow down there, big guy. I never said I was gonna give it to you. Just that I'd think about it.

Saejima: Then think harder. Or do I gotta rattle your brains a bit?

Kawana: Are you seriously threatening me? Me? Man, you're just as dumb as you look.

Saejima: Keep runnin' your mouth if ya want. Looks like there's only one way we're settlin' this. (Better get this done before the guards come.)

[He beats the inmates in less than a minute.]

Kawana: I give, I give! Just take the damn hoe and go.

Saejima: Appreciate it. Could've saved yourself a world o' trouble if you just gave it to me in the first place.

You "borrowed" a Hoe.

Saejima: (Perfect, now Kamiyama can make me that grapplin' hook.)

[He returns to Kamiyama.]

Saejima: Got everythin' ya asked for. Now can ya fix me up that grapplin' hook?

You handed over the Chain.

You handed over the Hoe.

Kamiyama: Wow... I'm amazed you actually scrounged up all the materials in here. This should be perfect, yes. Pardon me a moment while I step into my workshop. Sorry to keep you waiting. One grappling hook, just as ordered.

You got the Chain and Grappling Hook.

Kamiyama: I don't know what you're planning, and I prefer to keep it that way... but please, don't tell anyone where you got this.

Saejima: Don't worry, I ain't no snitch.

Kamiyama: Great. Seeing how you seem to do things, I bet whatever you're planning is... big. I can't wait to find out what it is. Anyway, good luck.

[Finally Taiga goes to Hamazaki.]

Hamazaki: Nice job getting that grappling hook. Now go hide it under the manhole near the guard tower. We'll grab it again once the plan's in motion.

[Taiga finds a hatchi in the ground and places the grappling hook there.]

You hid the Chain and Grappling Hook.

Saejima: (Think we're good to go. Here goes nothin'...)

[The next night…]

1:00 AM

[Night. Hamazaki wakes up in his cell and gets up from his bunk. Taiga looks like he hasn't slept a wink all night. He holds the cell key in his hand, then clutches it, ready to escape. Hamazaki disguises himself as a guard. Taiga notices Hamazaki running, opens his cell door, and throws the bed out of it. The rumble wakes up the whole prison.]

Inmate: The hell was that?

Inmate 2: Who's makin' that noise?

Inmate 3: Hey, I was sleeping...

[Five guards run in.]

Saito: What's going on in here!? Who's responsible for this? Come forward, now!

Guard 2: That's… Saejima. You better have a good reason for this, Saejima!

[Taiga slowly descends toward them.]

Guard: How did you get out of your cell? You don't really think you can escape? You realize what happens when you step out of line, yeah?

[Taiga stands silent.]

Inmate: Hey! Lemme out, too!

Saito: No hole for you this time. We're gonna bash your brains in right here. Hope you're ready. Okay, boys. Time to put this stray down. His execution date's come early. Do it!

Saejima: (Hamazaki just said to keep the guards busy, but it's easier to just flatten 'em all instead. Least I'll get the key quicker that way.)

[Taiga defeats them.]

Saito: Dammit...!

Saejima: Sorry, but I gotta your key.

You got the Section Key.

Saito: Heh. Go on, Saejima. Try and escape. We'll see how far you get.

Saejima: ……

Saito: You're not the first who's tried to fly the coop. But guess what? Not a single soul has made it out. Know why that is? 'Cause I've clipped their wings the moment they were dumb enough to try. But go ahead, let's see how far you get. You're still nowhere close.

====Head to the Director’s Office====
[Taiga runs through the corridors of the prison fighting the guards.]

Saejima: Finally here… (to Hamazaki) You're not done yet? What gives?

Hamazaki: None of this proves a damn thing! I need hard evidence!

[Prison guards run to the Director’s Office.]

Saejima: Dammit!

Prison Guards: Stop right there! This is as far as you go!

[Taiga defeats them.]

Saejima: Whew… Sorry, but I ain't gettin' caught. Not today.

Hamazaki: You all right?

Saejima: No problems here. How bout you?

Hamazaki: I’ve got everything I need. Lees roll.

Saejima: 'Bout tine.

====Escape!====
Hamazaki: We're gonna need to pick up the grappling hook before we start scaling the guard tower. C’mon! The roof'll take us out to the yard.

Saejima: Gotcha.

[They run outside.]

Hamazaki: Sniper! That's gonna be a problem. I’m gonna sneak behind and take him out. You keep him nice and distracted, and don't stand still! Long as you keep moving, he won't catch you.

[Taiga distracts the guards, dodging shots and breaking doors with his bare hands. Hamazaki meanwhile runs to the tower. He knocks out the sniper.]

Hamazaki: Saejima! Keep going! I'll catch up with you soon!

[They go back to the prison corridors.]

Hamazaki: Sorry to keep you waiting. C'mon, let's move. We're getting close.

Prison Guard: Hey, I need backup over here! I found the prisoners! We can't let them get away!

Hamazaki: Holy hell, that's a lot of guys. We're almost to the yard, though. Can't let them stop us now.

Saejima: Gotcha. Let's rock these fools!

[Together they defeat the guards.]

Hamazaki: Just gotta grab that grappling hook now!

[They run up to the hatch in the yard. The recent running and fighting has practically worn them both out.]

Hamazaki: This the place?

[Taiga uses his immense strength to lift the hatch and Hamazaki takes the grappling hook. He holds it out to Taiga. Taiga throws the grappling hook onto the wall, catching it over the edge.]

Saejima: You first.

Hamazaki: Me? How come?

Saejima: Escapin' was your idea, not mine. Only right you get goin' before me. Besides, if you don't make it out, this plan ain't worth shit to me.

Hamazaki: The hell are you saying, man?

Saejima: I'm done makin' mistakes. 'Wonderin' how different things'd be. And I'm done regrettin', too. Yeah, ya might not be the nicest guy. But ya didn't stab me in the back. That's all that matters now.

Hamazaki: Damn, man. You really are stuck in the past.

Saejima: Just get movin'! The guards'll be here any second!

[Hamazaki begins to climb. At that moment, the projectors turn on... Hamazaki gets to the top of the wall. Guards come up with truncheons.]

Hamazaki: Saejima! Saejima, get up here! Saejima! What the hell’re you doing!? C'mon!

Saejima: Listen. Don't wait up.

Hamazaki: You outta your mind!?

Saejima: I'm gonna buy ya a bit of time. You start swimmin'. Go.

Hamazaki: Saejima…

Saejima: Just move!

[Taiga defeats Saito and the other guards. He grabs the chain… but his strength is almost at an end. He touches the edge of the wall and... He falls, but Hamazaki grabs his arm.]

Saejima: Why?

[Hamazaki helps Taiga climb the wall. Both fall down without strength. A siren howls in the distance.]

Saejima: Why're you... still here?

Hamazaki: Eh. Thought it'd leave a bad taste in my mouth. Ditching you and all. Besides… You're only the second one. The second guy who's ever trusted me.

[He drops the chain to the other side of the wall.]

Hamazaki: It's all you this time. We made it up here safe. Only one thing left now. It's us against the sea. Your clocks ticking. Get down there.

Saejima: I get ya, but I…

Hamazaki: You're on death row! The quicker you can get outta here, the better.

Saejima: But…

Hamazaki: Don't worry. I got everything I need right here.

Saejima: The thing you took from the warden's office?

{It is absolutely unclear what he stole and keeps under his clothes. Documents? Money?}

Hamazaki: Yup. This here's my ticket back into business. Now move!

Saejima: Catch ya later… Brother.

Hamazaki: (surprised) Brother?

Saejima: Ya heard me. Hasn't been long, but we're partners in crime now. Brothers.

Hamazaki: Saejima...

[Taiga begins to come down the chain.]

Hamazaki: (cheerfully) Saejima! If we both somehow make it outta this alive… How 'bout we team up? You and me'd be unstoppable! The Tojo... Hell, the whole country could be ours! So, whaddya say? Pretty convincing, huh?

Saejima: Hamazaki…

Hamazaki: All you've gotta do is make it to shore.

[Suddenly Hamazaki got shot.]

Saejima: Hamazaki!

[Saito climbs on the wall. It is he who shot Hamazaki.]

Saito: Not on my watch. Criminal scum.

[He shot Hamazaki a few more times.]

Saejima: Hamazaki!

Hamazaki: Saejima… Once you hit shore, search out a man named Kiryu.

Saejima: Whaddya mean? We're goin' together, brother!

Hamazaki: He's here, in Okinawa. Dependable guy. It's Kiryu, got it?

Saejima: Hamazaki? Hamazaki! C'mon!

[Hamazaki grabs Saito.]

Saito: What are you doing!? Let go! No! Stop! Don't do it!

[Hamazaki jumps into the sea with Saito.]

Saejima: Hamazaki? Hamazaki! Shit!

[Taiga jumps in after Hamazaki.]

Chapter 2: TIGER AND DRAGON
March 5th, 5:00 PM
Okinawa

[We see a beautiful beach at Kiryu's orphanage. Haruka is walking with Mame.]

Haruka: Down, Mame! Be a good boy and stop pulling. Hey, Mame! What's wrong? You're usually so good. Mame!

[The dog runs to the beach.]

Haruka: What's gotten into you?

[She sees… Taiga on the beach. He’s unconscious. She drags him to the orphanage… somehow.]

Haruka: Please wake up, mister… Oh, he's opening his eyes!

Saejima: Urgh...

Haruka: I'm so glad you're okay!

Saejima: Huh? Where... am I?

Haruka: This is Morning Glory Orphanage. We have lots of kids, but this is the first time we've taken in an adult.

Saejima: An orphanage?

Haruka: Phew, I'm so glad you're okay, mister. I was worried you were dead when I found you down on the beach...

Saejima: Beach? What beach? ...Right. Must've washed up here.

Haruka: Are you sure you're okay, mister?

Saejima: Think so.

Haruka: My Uncle Kaz should be back any minute now. He thought you might've been shipwrecked, so he's checking in with the police. Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay.

Saejima: The cops!?

Haruka: Sorry for waking you up. You should rest. I'll go let Uncle Kaz know you're awake.

Saejima: Hold up!

[He grabs Haruka by the arm and she falls. Taiga finds herself above her in a very controversial pose.]

Saejima: Mister...?

[Taiga is hesitating, as if it were really thinking about taking advantage of the situation. Kiryu enters.]

Kiryu: Everything okay, Haruka?

Haruka: Uncle Kaz! You're back.

Kiryu: Yeah. Is he doing any better?

Haruka: (shakes off her skirt) Mhm. Much better. Oh, right! I should get over to the supermarket! I still need a few things for dinner!

Kiryu: Hm? Uh, sure.

Haruka: Well, be back soon! (runs away)

Kiryu: Glad to see you're up. How are you feeling?

Saejima: Fine enough. Sorry 'bout all the trouble.

Kiryu: Don't worry about it. The kids are out for a few days on a field trip, so I have plenty of time on my hands.

Saejima: Huh, guess luck ain't always goin' against me.

Kiryu: Now, I have to ask. What happened to you?

Saejima: I, uh...

Kiryu: Do you remember being passed out on the beach this morning? Haruka found you while she was out walking our dog.

Saejima: Haruka?

Kiryu: The girl who's been watching over you.

Saejima: Oh... So that's her name.

Kiryu: Yeah. Guess that means you still have your memory.

Saejima: Mhm.

Kiryu: Then tell me. How'd you end up washing up on our beach?

Saejima: Uh...

Kiryu: Is there a reason you don't want to tell me?

Saejima: Nah, it ain't that. It's just...

Kiryu: Can you at least tell me your name?

Saejima: ……

Kiryu: You can't even do that?

Saejima: Naw, I owe it to ya for all the help… But don't folks usually introduce themselves 'fore they go askin' a guy to do the same?

Kiryu: Fair point.

Saejima: Sorry. Not tryin' to ruffle any feathers.

Kiryu: It's okay. My name's Kiryu, Kazuma Kiryu.

Saejima: (Hold up, that's the guy Hamazaki was talkin' about!)

Kiryu: Something wrong?

Saejima: Oh, uh... Nah, it's nothin'.

Kiryu: All right, I gave you my name. Your turn now.

Saejima: It's... Suzuki. Yeah, that's it.

Kiryu: Suzuki-san, huh? Common name, though not really around here. I take it you're from the mainland?

Saejima: ……

Kiryu: I'll take that as a yes. Anyway, what are you going to do now? You didn't have a wallet or anything on you when you washed up.

Saejima: Huh?

Kiryu: You won't be able to go to the doctor or check in with the police without your ID. I can help you get in touch with your family if you need a hand, though.

Saejima: ……

Kiryu: Suzuki-san? I can't help you if you don't tell me what you need.

Saejima: Lemme ask ya somethin'... Is your name really Kiryu?

Kiryu: That's me.

Saejima: Heh. Well ain't life mysterious. Who'd have thought I'd end up floatin' right to your damn doorstep?

Kiryu: I don't think I understand.

Saejima: Kiryu-san. Ya gotta help me.

Kiryu: So let me get this straight. Someone on the boat you were working on mentioned me, and told you to look for me if you ever needed help.

Saejima: Mhm.

Kiryu: But then your ship sank and the rest of the crew drowned, while you narrowly managed to swim to shore.

Saejima: ...Yup.

Kiryu: Interesting.

Saejima: Listen, Kiryu-san. I know it's weird, but ya gotta help me. I need to get back to Kamurocho, no matter what. I'm not askin' for a hundred grand or nothing. Just enough to get me up to Tokyo. And don't worry, I'll pay ya back. Just as soon as I take care o’ business and scrape some cash together, I swear. So please. Please, loan me the money!

Kiryu: Suzuki-san.

Saejima: What's up?

Kiryu: How long were you in for?

Saejima: ...Huh?

Kiryu: How many years did you spend in prison?

Saejima: Wh-What're ya talkin' about?

Kiryu: Listen. I know you weren't out on a boat. I went into town when you were asleep and asked the coast guard if there were any accidents last night. It turns out, last night was one of the calmest they've had in months. Not a cloud in sight. And definitely not shipwreck weather.

Saejima: Uh...

Kiryu: Besides, what do you think it costs to get to Tokyo from Okinawa nowadays?

Saejima: I dunno, can't cost more than what... 30 grand?

{30 grand is about $260.}

Kiryu: That won't get you anything beyond the plane ticket. What about transportation to the airport? Or once you get up to Tokyo? Do you know how much a taxi ride would cost you?

Saejima: Well...

Kiryu: You don't need to pretend. I know you don't know. You've been locked up for years, haven't you?

Saejima: ...How'd ya figure it out?

Kiryu: It wasn't a tough conclusion to reach. I mean, look at you.

Saejima: So what, ya thought somethin' was off, then went n' pieced all that together?

Kiryu: ...It was because of Haruka.

Saejima: Haruka? Oh. Ya mean what happened this afternoon.

Kiryu: Yeah.

Saejima: You, uh... Ya saw that, huh?

Kiryu: Those were the eyes of someone who hasn't seen a woman in a long time. Hasn't been a part of everyday society. I know the feeling. The hopelessness you sink into behind bars. How difficult it can be to readjust once you're out. I was in for a long stretch, myself.

Saejima: Oh yeah?

Kiryu: I spent a decade alone in a dark cell. Honestly, I'm lucky it wasn't longer.

Saejima: Lucky, at 10 years? Must'a been in for murder.

Kiryu: I'm guessing your sentence was longer... Or should I say, is longer? Well?

Saejima: Rgh...

Kiryu: I won't tell you what to do, but here's some advice. You should turn yourself into the police before they catch you themselves.

Saejima: But...

Kiryu: They might go easy on you if you go peacefully. Before the media catches wind of your story.

Saejima: Hrm...

Kiryu: So, what do you think? If that's what you want to do, I'd be glad to lend you a hand.

Saejima: Heh. Hehe... Ahahahaha!

Kiryu: What's so funny?

Saejima: Don't ya get it? There ain't no goin' back for me. They'd execute me on sight!

Kiryu: ...So you're on death row.

Saejima: Ya call 10 years hard time? Talk to me when ya done 25! All that matters to me now is gettin' back to Kamurocho, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make sure it happens. This ain't about gettin' a fresh start. Never has been. All I'm hopin' to do is find the truth. That, and make those bastards taste the pain I been dealin' with these 25 years. Don't ya get it? I gotta avenge my boss, even if it kills me!

Kiryu: Revenge, huh...

Saejima: Kiryu-san. I'm real grateful for all ya done for me. You n' the little lady. But I can't stick around. Ya know too much about me now. So please. Just gimme some money before this gets ugly.

Kiryu: Hm...

Saejima: I'm beggin' ya, Kiryu-san!

Kiryu: The answer's no.

Saejima: Why not!?

Kiryu: I'm not sure what got you tossed in prison… But I'm not helping you get revenge. I've seen enough people walk that path before. And I can tell you, no matter how much you want it… Misery's the only thing waiting for you at the end. If you still want to go through with it, I need a good reason. Until then, I can't help you.

Saejima: And if I said... I can't tell ya? 

Kiryu: Then I’ll stop you. Here and now.

[Taiga prepares for a fight.]

Kiryu: I'll take that as a no.

Saejima: Sorry 'bout this. But I gotta know the truth. Ain't no one keepin' me from that!

Kiryu: So that's how it is. 

Saejima: You and me, we ain't so different. Ya remind me of my sworn brother.

Kiryu: You remind me of someone, too.

Saejima: Y'know, I'm relieved. Up against you, I don't gotta worry about killin' you by accident.

Kiryu: Right. Consider this a test, then. To see just how bad you want this.

Saejima: Ya ready… Kiryu!?

Kiryu: Bring it!

[A fateful battle is taking place! Taiga Saegima vs Kazuma Kiryu!!!! Taiga nominally wins, but in the cutscene they continue to fight and fight as equals.]

Saejima: Ya ain't half bad.

Kiryu: Same to you. I'm honestly surprised.

Haruka: What are you doing? Uncle Kaz! What's wrong with you!? Stop it, please!

[They accidentally push Haruka and she falls to the ground.]

Kiryu: Haruka!

[Suddenly Taiga gets dizzy. His wounds are not yet healed. Haruka runs up to him.]

Haruka: Mister! Mister, are you okay?

Saejima: Shit… How am I… Gonna face Hamazaki now....?

Kiryu: Hamazaki?

Saejima: Dammit. Body's... so heavy...

[He falls on the sand.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz, who is he?

[They bring Taiga to the orphanage.]

Kiryu: How is he?

Haruka: Not good. It looks like he's been having nightmares.

Kiryu: Right... The doctor said he's exhausted. Probably malnourished, too.

Haruka: Hm...

Kiryu: You're worried about him, aren't you? I can tell.

Haruka: Yeah. That, and...

Kiryu: You're still thinking about what he said on the beach.

Haruka: Uh-huh.

Kiryu: What about it?

Haruka: That "Hamazaki" he mentioned... That's the guy who stabbed you last year. I'd never forget that name. And I can't trust someone who says they're friends with him.

Kiryu: Believe me, I know how you feel.

Haruka: If he's really friends with Hamazaki, I... I…

Kiryu: Hate him?

Haruka: I... don't know.

Kiryu: Listen, Haruka. Even if he does know Hamazaki, that doesn't automatically mean he's a bad person.

Haruka: But—

Kiryu: Sure, Hamazaki was a bit unhinged the last time we met. But a lot can change in a year. When he lost the fight for the Tojo Clan, he lost the only thing that meant something to him. I was probably the only one he could take his anger out on.

Haruka: Maybe...

Kiryu: If Hamazaki came to me now asking for help, I'd give it to him in a heartbeat. As long as he's learned to have some faith in his fellow man, that is.

Haruka: Uncle Kaz…

Kiryu: So, what do you say, Haruka?

Haruka: Huh?

Kiryu: Do you really think he's a bad guy just because he knows Hamazaki?

Haruka: I don't know what I think...

Kiryu: He's a yakuza, no question. The tattoo's a dead giveaway. But I have one of those too. He and I aren't so different in that respect.

Haruka: Yeah, but...

Kiryu: You've seen plenty of men like us over the years. Some good, some bad. Where do you think he falls on that spectrum?

Haruka: Well, if I had to pick... I don't think he's a bad person.

Kiryu: Yeah?

Haruka: But I can't say for sure. That's just the impression I get.

Kiryu: All right, then. Good to know.

Haruka: Huh? Are you going somewhere?

Kiryu: I have some shopping to do.

Haruka: Right now?

Kiryu: Yeah. He'll need a nice meal when he comes to. The doctor said he hasn't been eating very well, after all.

Haruka: But aren't all the stores closed by now?

Kiryu: Don't worry, I'm sure somewhere in town will still be open.

Haruka: Maybe, but...

Kiryu: What's wrong? Are you worried about being left alone with him?

Haruka: No, it's not that. It's just...

Kiryu: Relax. He's not going to hurt you. That's not the kind of man he

Haruka: ...Okay.

Kiryu: Well, I should be going. I won't be gone long. Before I forget, Haruka. There's a bag over by the door. I think it must be his.

Haruka: I didn't see any bags.

Kiryu: I found it on the beach. Once he's awake again, I want you to give it to him.

Haruka: Okay, I will.

Kiryu: Thanks, Haruka. (leaves)

[At 305 AM Taiga wakes up.]

Haruka: Oh, sorry! I must've dozed off.

Saejima: I was laid out here the whole time?

Haruka: Yeah. Are you feeling-any-better, Suzuki-san?

Saejima: Suzuki? Oh, yeah. Where's Kiryu-han?

Haruka: You mean Uncle Kaz? He's out shopping. He said we should fix you something to help you recover.

Saejima: That so?

Haruka: Oh yeah. Here we... go!

[She brings a brown bag.]

Haruka: Phew, that was heavy. Here's your bag. It's yours, right, Suzuki-san? Uncle Kaz said to give it to you when you woke up.

[Taiga opens the bag.]

Haruka: He told me he found it on the beach. You're the only one it could belong to.

[Inside the suitcase he finds a letter, a suit, and an envelope containing 50,000 yen.]

{50,000 yen is about $434.}

[Taiga holds back tears as hard as he can.]

Haruka: What's wrong, Suzuki-san? Are you okay?

Saejima: Huh? Yeah... I'm good.

Haruka: Suzuki-san?

Saejima: Little miss. Er, Haruka-chan. I ‘preciate all ya done. This here's goodbye for now. Ya might not see me for a while.

Haruka: But it's just past three in the morning.

Saejima: I don't got the time to wait.

[Taiga changes into what looks like military clothing. It makes him look even scarier.]

Haruka: But you're still hurt really bad, Suzuki-san. At least stay and rest a bit more.

Saejima: Can't do that, Haruka-chan.

Haruka: Suzuki-san.

Saejima: It ain't Suzuki. Name's Saejima. Taiga Saejima.

Haruka: Saejima… san?

Saejima: Ya got it. Tell Kiryu-san, too. That Saejima was here.

Haruka: Okay.

Saejima: I won't forget what ya did for me. We'll meet again someday.  Pass that along, too.

Haruka: I will.

Saejima: Later, then.

[He leaves. Kiryu watches him go and then returns to the orphanage.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz!

Kiryu: Sorry I took so long.

Haruka: Uncle Kaz, Suzuki-san… I mean, Saejima-san just left!

Kiryu: Did he, now?

Haruka: You're not gonna stop him? There's no way he's fully recovered.

Kiryu: I'm sure he'll be just fine. (grabs a cigarette)

Haruka: How are you so confident? And what about the groceries, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Oh, yeah. Turns out you were right. The stores were all closed.

Haruka: (falls on the floor) I can't figure out how you grownups work sometimes.

[Kiryu smiles.]

Chapter 3: THE 25 YEAR VACUUM
March 6th, 2010
Kamurocho, Tokyo

[Taiga Saejima returns to Kamurocho after 25 years in prison.]

Saejima: This really Kamurocho?

[Some pedestrian bumps into him.]

Rude Pedestrian: Ouch! Outta the way, old timer!

Saejima: What happened to this place? (Kamurocho's gone down the crapper these last 25 years. Welp, time to track down the boss. Guess I'll start with the oľ Sasai Family HQ, out in front of West Park.)

====Find Sasai====
[He finds his old office.]

Saejima: (This was my family's turf. Ain't no sign of 'em now. S'pose I'll try askin' folks around here.)

[He asks a bum exploring trash cans nearby.]

Saejima: Got a sec? The Sasai Family used to have an office 'round these parts. Know anything 'bout that?

Homeless Guy: Well, I remember some yakuza types used to hang out here, but that was, what... 20, 30 years ago?

Saejima: Yeah, those guys. Any idea where their boss went?

Homeless Guy: Sorry, can't say I do. Toku-san might, though.

Saejima: Who's Toku and where do I find him?

Homeless Guy: Another homeless guy like me. He's been busking around town for decades. Spends his days down in the underground mall.

Saejima: The hell's that?

Homeless Guy: It's a bunch of stores they set up under Showa Street. Built just a while back. The whole thing's one big, fancy shopping center beneath the streets. Hence the name.

Saejima: Alright then, guess I'll go see if your pal Toku's still hangin' 'round this underground mall.

Homeless: Guy He should be. And I'm sure he'll be able to tell you what you want to know.

[Taiga finds the homeless in the mall. He sits on the floor.]

Saejima: You Toku?

Homeless Man: Hm? Yeah, that's me. And who are you?

Saejima: Name's Saejima. I'm lookin' for anyone who knew Kamurocho back in the day, 'round 25 years ago. Someone said you might. I hear ya been living in these parts a long time.

Toku: That I have. Over 30 years—maybe more? Guess I lost count.

Saejima: Yeah? Ever heard of the Sasai Family?

Toku: Hmm, the name does ring a bell...

Saejima: They had an office by West Park till at least 25 years ago.

Toku: Oh, right... It's starting to come back to me.

Saejima: Well, what can ya tell me about 'em?

Toku: It's kinda fuzzy. Some alkeehol might jog my memory.

Saejima: Alkee-what?

Toku: Booze. Hooch. Alkeehol. I live off the stuff, but it's been days since I could afford a drink. I just can't think straight when I'm sober.

Saejima: ……(Maybe I oughta go grab some booze.),

Toku: Oh, you don't have any alkeehol on you? Shame. A stiff drink would clear these cobwebs.

[Taiga buys some beer in a nearby dollar store.]

Toku: Oh, you again. Did you bring me some booze?

Saejima: (I oughta have some booze on me still.)

You handed over the Kin-Mugi Beer.

Saejima: Cheers. Now let's hear 'bout the Sasai Family.

Toku: Ooh, thanks! Hold on a second while I fuel up. Welcome back, my old friend. No, not you, the booze. *glug, glug, glug* Ahhh... That's the good stuff. Warms the body and soul!

Saejima: I'm happy for ya. You remember anything yet?

Toku: Oh, right, the Sasai Family. Sorry to break this to you, but they're long gone.

Saejima: So it's true... What about the boss? Where's Sasai-san?

Toku: I'm afraid I don't know what became of their patriarch.

Saejima: ……

Toku: Ah, don't let it get you down. Besides, yakuza don't exactly advertise their comings and goings. He might very well still be around.

Saejima: ……

Toku: Sorry I wasn't much help. Wait, I know. Why not go back to where it all began? That always helps me find things.

Saejima: (Might as well start with my old apartment. Not like I got any other leads to work with.)

[Taiga goes to his old apartment. When he gets to the roof he sees some guy in a jersey beats up some yakuza. Taiga decides not to intervene.]

Yakuza: (to the guy) How the...?

Kido: You fools always get the wrong idea about me. I get it. I look like your run-of-the-mill punk. So everyone thinks I'm some kinda pussy. But come on! Some little shit working directly under Arai-aniki? Well, that'd just never happen. You thought I'd be easy pickings, huh? Dumbasses. You and the whole damn Shibata Family. You keep pulling this shit, you're never gonna catch Arai-aniki.

[Taiga comes out of the door.]

Saejima: Hey. Did you just say “Shibata Family”?

Kido: Who's asking?

Saejima: Ex-member of the Tojo Clan's Sasai Family.

Kido: Never heard of them.

Saejima: These goons ya just wasted they all Shibata's?

Kido: Maybe. What's it to you?

Saejima: (threatening) You in the business?

Kido: The yakuza? Uh, yeah...

Saejima: What family?

Kido: Er, I'm with the Tojo. The, uh... Shibata Family, actually.

Saejima: Why were ya just poundin' on your own boys?

Kido: Um, it's kinda complicated...

Saejima: (threatening) They jump ya for droppin' out?

Kido: No, not exactly.

Saejima: Well, you're obviously no friend of Shibata's. Just the man I need.

Kido: Wait - need me? For what?

Saejima: You're gonna help me find my boss, Sasai-san.

Kido: Ah! Hup!

[He pushes Taiga away and runs.]

Saejima: Ngh!

Kido: Sorry, man, but I got my own shit to take care of!

Saejima: Fuck!

====Chase Kido====
[Taiga catches Kido in the children’s park.]

Kido: *panting* Who even are you?

Saejima: Just a guy lookin' for answers. C'mon, kid, I need your help.

Kido: Fine. Whatever. Just lemme catch my breath.

[He tells Taiga his story.]

Saejima: Damn... That's some heavy shit.

Kido: You're telling me. I mean, my own clan's after me now.

Saejima: How 'bout Arai? No sign of him yet?

Kido: Nope. Hard to find him with those Shibata thugs on my ass. And Akiyama-san can't help on this one.

Kido: It's a goddamn nightmare, man.

Saejima: Akiyama the moneylender—he okay?

Kido: Yeah, he'll be fine. The police have Sky Finance under 24-hour watch. Shibata can't risk messing with him for now.

Saejima: The fuzz? Shit...

Kido: You okay, man? You look like you're gonna puke.

Saejima: I'm fine. Anyway, good thing the cops are watchin' him.

Kido: So wait, what the hell's this Sasai Family you keep talking about?

Saejima: A family run by Hideki Sasai. We're a third-tier group that's part of the Tojo. 'Least, we were 25 years ago.

Kido: No shit? Just like Kanemura Enterprises.

Saejima: Back then, the Sasai and Shibata families were rivals despite both bein' Tojo.

Kido: Wait, our parent family!?

Saejima: Sasai-san and Shibata were both lookin' to climb the ladder.

Kido: A good old power struggle between rival families, huh?

Saejima: I was ready to do whatever it took. Anything to get my patriarch a top spot in the clan. So I agreed to the hit.

Kido: Hit?

Saejima: Murder. I took out Yoshiharu Uen and the other Ueno Seiwa brass who were jockeyin' with the Tojo. Gunned 'em down in a ramen joint.

Kido: The Ueno Seiwa— Wait, you mean that hit!?

Saejima: Ya heard of it? Yeah, that was me.

Kido: Hold on just a second, pops. That's the shooting where one dude took out like 18 people, isn't it? You're a living legend!

Saejima: Ain't nothin' legendary 'bout pointing a gun and pulling the trigger. All I cared about was makin' sure my patriarch rose through the ranks. Even if I hung for it. Surprisin' thing was, my time never came. 'Least not yet.

Kido: Wait, if you got... If you're a... That means you...

Saejima: Busted out? Yup, jus' the other day.

Kido: What the fuck!?

Saejima: Pipe down, kid. Relax. I just wanna know the truth. See it with my own two eyes before I bite the dust.

Kido: The truth about what?

Saejima: Whether my boss really just up and vanished.

Kido: Huh...

Saejima: And whether my bro Majima really did stab me in the back. So whaddya say? Think ya can help?

Kido: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold the phone, man!

Saejima: ...What?

Kido: This shit's way out of my freaking league! I mean, you're the legendary Taiga Saejima! There's no way I can help you!

Saejima: Why not?

Kido: C'mon, man. I'm a nobody - practically still a street punk. Hell, I've got my own family on my ass! And you're asking me to help you? That's crazy talk!

Saejima: I ain't expectin' much.

Kido: Huh?

Saejima: Just need an introduction.

Kido: To who?

Saejima: Someone who knows what went down in Kamurocho back in '85. Someone who knows the truth.

Kido: Right. You said you were looking for the real story...

Saejima: Mhm. Any ideas?

Kido: ...Aha!

Saejima: What?

Kido: There's a guy who can help. He'll definitely have the info you're looking for!

Saejima: Who?

Kido: An information broker. Best of the best.

Saejima: An informant, huh?

Kido: Let's get out of here before the cops come by and start asking questions. And who knows when those Shibata assholes will show up. again. Follow me. There's a place I go to when I need to lay low.

Saejima: Ya got a hideout?

Kido: Yeah, come on. 

====Head to the Hideout====
Kido: Come on, this way. It's right down this hallway. Almost there. It's just down the escalator. This is it.

Saejima: Huh...

Kido: It's a long story, but let's just say the last tenants here moved out in a hurry, so I've helped myself to the space.

Saejima: Lotta homeless folks around.

Kido: This is kind of their turf. We're the squatters down here. Oh yeah, let me tell you what I know about that informant.

Saejima: I'm all ears.

Kido: They say he keeps tabs on everything that happens in Kamurocho, past and present. I don't know who the guy is or how he knows what he knows, but word on the street is there's not much he doesn't.

Saejima: Wonder how much of it's just rumor.

Kido: I'm just telling you what I've overheard. Apparently, he pays homeless people to gather his intel. You might have the best luck asking them about him. Oh, I almost forgot.

Saejima: Forgot what?

Kido: The streets are practically crawling with cops today. Better watch yourself out there.

Saejima: Alright.

[He leaves the hideout and sees a nervous homeless man.]

Saejima: (Hm? A homeless guy... Maybe I could ask him about the info dealer.) Excuse me. Was wonderin' if I could ask ya something.

Panicked Homeless Man: Hey! You! Come over here!

Saejima: What happened?

Panicked Homeless Man: We'll talk later! Just follow me!

Saejima: Hold yer horses, old man. Where the hell’re ya headed in such a hurry?

Panicked Homeless Man: It's the Master! He's gonna die if we don't do something!

Saejima: The Master?

Panicked Homeless Man: Yeah. He's a famous old man around these parts. Been digging a hole down in the sewers for ages now. But enough chitchat! We gotta hurry!

[They run to a manhole.]

Saejima: A manhole? You sure about this?

Panicked Homeless Man: It's the fastest way! Just follow me!

Saejima: Easier said than done, old man. How am I supposed to get through a manhole?

Panicked Homeless: Man I got a special tool for opening manhole covers. But you're bigger than a buffalo, so you probably don't even need it. Anyways, we oughta hurry! Come on! Over there!

[They see a few thugs harassing an old man.]

Punk-like Man: Enough bull, old man. It's time you told us the truth. We don't like to get rough with frail geezers, so do us a favor and start talking.

Old Man: I can't let you go any further! All these years o' hard work woulda been for nothing!

Punk-like Man: We know you're hiding tons of buried treasure back there! That's why you been digging like this since the stone age!

Old Man: There ain't no buried treasure! Now get the hell outta here!

Punk-like Man: It's no fair if you hog all that money to yourself. Share the loot… why don't you, grandpa? Come on, this is taking too long. If you're not gonna move, then we'll just have to move you!

Panicked Homeless Man: Oh no! They're gonna kill the Master! You look like a pretty strong guy. Please get rid of those hooligans and save the Master!

Help Him ✓
Don't Help

Saejima: I'll talk to 'em.

Panicked Homeless Man: Really!? Thank you, kind sir!

Punk-like Man: Listen, gramps, tell us what we wanna know or it ain't the retirement home you're headed for. Got it?

Saejima: Wait right there. You kids havin' fun pickin' on senior citizens? Ain't ya supposed to care for the elderly?

Punk-like Man: Who the fuck are you, huh? One of this guy's homeless friends?

Saejima: Don't matter. Just let this whole thing go and get lost.

Punk-like Man: So you're after the loot too! You think we don't know what's up?

Saejima: Gimme a break already. Kids these days dunno when to listen.

Punk-like Man: Enough talk! We're gonna float both your geriatric corpses down the fuckin' sewer!

[Taiga kicks their sorry asses.]

Punk-like Man: Who the hell is this guy? Some sorta monster or somethin!? Dammit! This ain't the last you heard of us, old man!

Saejima: Street punks and their cowardly lines never change.

Old Man: You saved my life. Thank you.

Saejima: Thank this guy, not me. He's the one that was doin' all the worryin'.

Relieved Homeless Man: Master, you okay!? Did they hurt you?

Old Man: Oh, it's you. Yeah, I'm all right.

Relieved Homeless Man: Thank goodness! I was scared outta my mind! (to Taiga) I owe you, sir! You really are something! By the way, what was your name again?

Saejima: Saejima. You?

Relieved Homeless Man: People call me Ken-chan. And this here's the Master.

Master: I didn't come up with that nickname, but call me whatever you want.

Saejima: So why were them punks after ya anyways?

Master: Been down here lookin' for a certain somethin'. Somethin' important. But then those hoodlums showed up, spoutin' nonsense about buried treasure and the like.

Saejima: Somethin' important?

Master: Yep. Ain't even sure what it is exactly. My father only told me about it on his deathbed. Said he buried somethin' important beneath the streets of Kamurocho.

Saejima: I see...

Master: He told me the general location, but we got more sewers an' newfangled underground malls croppin' up every day. Makes things harder to find.

Saejima: So ya mean he buried whatever it is before all this was built?

Master: Exactly. I reckon durin' the war.

Saejima: Wow, that's a long time ago. So how many years ya been diggin?

Master: Well, heard from my father 'bout it when I was 50, so I reckon maybe 25 years. Give or take a few.

Saejima: 25 years...

Ken-chan: Master, this guy's pretty strong. How about asking him to help you dig?

Master: And why would I do that?

Ken-chan: You've been saying your back hurts, right? And you're not getting any younger.

Master: Oh, shut yer trap! I still got it in me!

Ken-chan: You don't have to be so hardheaded! Saejima-san, will you help the Master dig? Please!

Saejima: Ya really been digging this hole for 25 years?

Master: Pretty much.

Saejima: ……I see. Well, I'll help whenever I got the time.

Master: Seriously, kid? You ain't even involved. Might not be anything in it for ya either.

Saejima: Consider it karma. Plus, haven't had a good workout since comin' to Kamurocho. Don't worry about it.

Ken-chan: Perfect! You just might find what you're looking for before you pass on, Master!

Master: Will you quit talkin' about me dyin' already!? Geez! Saejima, was it? I may talk a lot, but I can't stop the years from pilin' on. Honestly, this old man'd be really happy if ya lent a hand, even if it's only for a little.

Saejima: Got it. I'll come by and help when I can.

Master: Thank you, son. I'm in your debt. Ain't much of a reward, I guess, but do ya know about Revelations?

Saejima: Revelations?

Master: Yep. Revelations allow you to learn new techniques by observing various events around town. Might just be able to discover somethin' new if ya capture those decisive moments in material form.

Saejima: But I don't have a camera. Never been much good with machines anyway.

Master: Same here. Couldn't afford it either. That's why I use these babies.

Saejima: A hammer and chisel?

Master: I'll give ya some good carvin' wood too. Use that there hammer and chisel to carve the events you see. Ask Ken-chan about what's goin' on above ground. He may have some good information.

Saejima: I think I get it. I'll give it a try.

You got a Woodcarving Set.

Saejima: (Well, looks like I've settled things here. Time to investigate that legendary info dealer. Wonder if any of the homeless might know something...)

Ken-chan: Hey, Saejima-san. I know why you're here. You want to know about Revelations, right? I was just walking around the Kamurocho Central Parking Lot and heard some kids saying something about a professional killer in the area. Might be something there worth investigating. Why don't you go have a look?

====Find Florist====
[Taiga wanders around and talks to the homeless.]

Kanai: All of Kamurocho's been on edge these past few days. Like something bad's about to happen. Every year there's some new, earth-shattering catastrophe. Is this city ever gonna know peace?

Nakano: You're searching for the city's biggest info dealer the Florist, right?

Saejima: If that's his name.

Nakano: That's what his clients call him, anyway. It's because the info he sells gets delivered inside flower bouquets.

Saejima: Sounds real romantic. So how's a guy meet this Florist?

Nakano: The thing is, no one really knows, what with all the crazy stuff that's happened around here over the past few years. Seems like every time a major crisis hits the city, he uproots his headquarters and relocates.

Saejima: Any idea where he's planted himself now?

Nakano: Don't know for sure, but there is a rumor going around.

Saejima: I'm listenin'.

Nakano: I heard you can get to his hideout through the back of the public restroom at West Park.

Saejima: Ya mean the john at the north end of town?

Nakano: That's the one. I'd start there at West Park if I were you.

Saejima: Alright, thanks. (West Park's crapper still oughta be to the northeast.)

[Taiga goes to the very toilet where the entrance to Purgatory is located. He tries to open the door to the booth, but it is locked. Taiga forcefully breaks down the door and sees a man inside using the toilet... for its intended purpose. The man is terrified. Ignoring him, Taiga breaks through the second door, but fails.]

Saejima: My bad.

[He leaves the restroom.]

Saejima: (Back to square one. I gotta figure out how to dig up dirt on that hotshot info broker everyone's yappin' about.)

[Taiga accidentally overhears a man muttering to himself...]

Tsurumi: So that was the Florist of Sai...

Saejima: Hey. What'd ya just say 'bout the Florist?

Tsurumi: Uh, what? Nothing, nothing at all!

Saejima: I know what I heard. Don't lie to me!

Tsurumi: Please cut me some slack. Around here, a slip of the tongue could cost a guy... well, his tongue. Or his life!

Saejima: Relax. I ain't no snitch.

Tsurumi: Well then, uh, if I let you in on my secret, do you promise not to tell anyone?

I promise. ✓
No promises.

Saejima: I promise. Won't tell a soul.

Tsurumi: Okay, I guess I'll trust you. Keeping it a secret is killing me, anyway. I'm on a city crew that was doing some work on the manhole over in Children's Park. That's when I found it.

Saejima: Found what?

Tsurumi: A subterranean pleasure district. But they only let in the super rich, and even then just a select few elites. I thought it was all an urban legend, but it's real.

Saejima: How'd ya find it?

Tsurumi: Well, uh, I was sneaking a nap down in the manhole when I heard someone come in.

Saejima: Who?

Tsurumi: I think it was the big cheese himself: the Florist of Sai. He's the info broker who calls the shots down there. He was wearing some real flashy clothes. The kind you see on magazines in the waiting room at the dentist's office.

Saejima: And?

Tsurumi: He kept on going down the tunnel until he disappeared. When I took a look later, I found a door at the end.

Saejima: Where's it go?

Tsurumi: Dunno. I didn't open it.

Saejima: The hell! Why not?

Tsurumi: It was a really heavy door. I couldn't get it to budge. I bet there's some trick to it only the Florist knows. If the rumors about the Florist are true, I'd rather keep my nose on my face than poke it where it doesn't belong.

Saejima: ……

Tsurumi: Then again, that stuff's all hearsay and tabloid gossip. No idea where the legend ends and the truth begins. All I know is what I saw with my own eyes. Just remember, you promised to keep this a secret.

Saejima: Don't worry, I ain't tellin' no one. (Assuming this guy ain't feedin' me a big crock of shit, I oughta check out the manhole in Children's Park.)

[Taiga goes to the park and sees a young yakuza beating the old one with a wooden sword.]

Upstart Yakuza: I knew you were a lost cause! I'm talking about cold, hard cash here. I've got no use for you without it!

Seasoned Yakuza: Urgh...

Saejima: Hey. What're you two bumblefuckin' around in public for? Any goddamn passerby can see you're up to yakuza shit.

Upstart Yakuza: Keep moving! This is none of your business.

Saejima: (grabs the sword) Show's over, kid. There's civvies all over the damn place. Nobody wants to watch ya fuck up a defenseless man.

Seasoned Yakuza: Stay out of this, please. It really has nothing to do with you.

Saejima: The hell...?

Seasoned Yakuza: I appreciate your concern, but I deserve this. Please just let me be.

Saejima: ……

Seasoned Yakuza: I'm sorry, Katagiri-san. I'll get the money, so please... Have mercy on me, sir.

Katagiri: Aw, this ain't fun anymore. Listen, Irie. You still owe us 500K for your tribute. Pay up fast or pay with your pinkie.

Saejima: Irie-han, is it? What was that all about?

Irie: And who might you be?

Saejima: Nobody. Used to be in the business myself, though.

Irie: Interesting. It's not every day that a "nobody" manages to leave the yakuza with all 10 fingers.

Saejima: Yeah, well... What was that punk beatin' up on ya for?

Irie: It's an embarrassing story... Katagiri-san and I belong to a family with an office down Tenkaichi Alley. I asked for more time to come up with my unpaid family tribute, but it seems to have rubbed him the wrong way.

Saejima: Clearly ya got a few years on this Katagiri boy, not to mention loads more class. How'd he get to be your boss?

Irie: I am indeed older, and have been in the family much longer. But Katagiri-san is the patriarch's golden boy.

Saejima: That scrawny chicken? Ya don't say.

Irie: Katagiri-san has brought in a great deal of money to the family.

Saejima: Man, even the yakuza are all about chasin' yen these days.

Irie: Welcome to the 21st century, friend. In this digital age, organized crime has become a thinking man's game. Unfortunately, old-school heavies are behind the times. Brawlers like me are becoming burdens to our clan.

Saejima: That can't be right. Just rough that greenhorn up a little. He'll change his tune.

Irie: I can't do that. He's helped my family grow exponentially. Besides, Katagiri-san is my superior, regardless of how he got there. I could never raise a hand against him.

Saejima: I gotcha. Sorry for buttin' into your family matters.

Irie: I really do appreciate the concern. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some tribute money to drum up, fast.

Saejima: (Money, money, money. This is one cold world we're livin' in. Irie said his family's office is down Tenkaichi Alley...)

[Taiga walks up to the manhole, but some underage thugs are already standing next to him.]

Saejima: I need to get down that manhole. You're in my way.

Tatekawa: Yo, this is our turf. We don't have to do shit for you.

Yoshioka: Hahaha, I get it! I bet pops here lives down there.

Kusuno: Hehehe, like a sewer rat? That's freaking hilarious!

Saejima: ……

Tatekawa: We'll let you through, but you'll have to pay the toll to get into this hole.

Saejima: And if I don't?

Kusuno: Hahaha, then we'll beat you to a bloody pulp!

Yoshioka: That's right. So I suggest you just pay up, pops.

Saejima: What a joke.

Tatekawa: Ex-fucking-scuse me? You just screwed with the wrong crew!

Saejima: Shut your trap and let's go. I wanna see ya try and beat me to a bloody pulp.

Kusuno: You asked for it, old man!

[Taiga beat some sense into them.]

Tatekawa: Umph... Sorry. No more, please.

Kusuno: Yeah, we don't want any more trouble.

Saejima: Just shut up and step aside. And I don't wanna see ya 'round Kamurocho no more.

Tatekawa: Yes, sir! We're outta here!

Saejima can enter manholes. He can access the underground routes from these manholes and go to various areas in Kamurocho.

[Taiga falls into the Florist's domain, the local Red Light District. He enters a mansion on the far side of the street.]

Saejima: ...The hell is with this place?

?: Ah, there you are.

Saejima: Who in the goddamn...?

The Florist: I've been waiting for you, Taiga Saejima. While you've been looking for me, I've had my eye on you. So, is there something you wanted to ask me?

Saejima: Yeah.

Ask About Purgatory 
Ask About the Florist ✓

Saejima: Folks call you some kinda info broker.

The Florist: That they do. I'm a dealer, and the drug I sell is intel. Information on everything that goes down in Kamurocho eventually reaches my ears, one way or another. I have a network of informers at my fingertips and surveillance cameras mounted all over town. I've got eyes in every nook and cranny.

Saejima: (Time for some answers...) So what's the deal with this Purgatory joint?

The Florist: You know that entertainment area you saw as you came in?

Saejima: Kinda hard to miss.

The Florist: Well, I built it myself years ago. What you see, I created. Kamurocho's rich and famous come here from all quarters for a taste of the pleasures they can't get aboveground. We cater to every taste, no matter how decadent. Gambling, sex, things of that nature. Normally, potential clients are carefully screened before I let them in, though I've made an exception in your case. But these pleasures are going to cost you. Just be careful the place doesn't suck you in. Don't forget, you're a man on a mission. You being here means there's something you want to know. Something only I can find out for you.

Saejima: Yeah. I'm lookin' for Hideki Sasai, Patriarch of the Sasai Family—or at least he was back in '85. Know where he's at?

The Florist: I do, but my intel doesn't come cheap.

Saejima: Name your price.

The Florist: Let's say 10 million yen.

{10 million yen is about $87,000}

Saejima: That a joke? I ain't holdin' that kinda cash. But you already knew that, didn't ya?

The Florist: Of course. I wouldn't be much of an info dealer if I didn't. But you do have another option. There's something you can do for me instead.

Saejima: Yeah? Let's hear it.

The Florist: Heh... Follow me.

[He brings Taiga to the Coliseum.]

Saejima: What kinda place is this?

The Florist: The Underground Coliseum. Only VIP members are allowed to spectate the fights here.

Saejima: I'm guessin' you're not inviting me to watch.

The Florist: Exactly. I want you to enter the exhibition deathmatch I'm holding.

Saejima: Deathmatch?

The Florist: Heh. That's right, a bona fide deathmatch. Not like that fake crap they show on TV. Two fighters enter the ring, only one walks out alive.

Saejima: ……

The Florist: I'm not going to force you against your will. But if you can't pay, this is your only option to obtain that info on your old boss.

Saejima: Fine. I'm in.

The Florist: It's settled, then. There's only one rule: weapons and medicines are strictly forbidden during the match. Now, I suggest you go prepare yourself. Come see me when you're ready to begin. I take it you're ready to enter the coliseum?

Not yet. 
I'm ready. ✓
I'm broke.

Saejima: Yeah, I'm ready.

The Florist: All right, then. Let's go.

[Taiga gets in the ring.]

Announcer: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 3,632nd Kamurocho Coliseum Tournament! Today's event: the champion in an exhibition deathmatch! In the blue corner... Our challenger, Taiga Saejima! 25 years ago, this beast took on an enemy clan all by himself. And put 18 of their finest men six feet under! A truly legendary hitman! This escaped convict's out for blood. Taiga Saejima! And in the red corner... Our tournament champion! In the six months since his arena debut, he hasn't lost once in 100 fights! The ultimate fist, the unstoppable warrior. Give it up for our current champion… Ivan Ibrahimovic! Today's fight will feature one special rule: No draws, no mercy. Only one will leave the ring alive… in this brutal fight. Only one will leave the ring alive... in this brutal fight to the death! Now, the gong!

[Taiga wins, but is in no hurry to kill Ibrahimovic.]

Guest 1: Do it! We wanna see him bleed!

Guest 2: Yeah, end that fool!

Guest 3: I thought this was a deathmatch!

Guest 4: The hell, man? Quit stalling!

Crowd: Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

Guest 5: You already buried 18 other poor saps! What's the big deal adding one more!?

Guest 6: What're you waiting for? Finish him off!

[Someone throws him a sword. Taiga picks it up and takes it out of its sheath. The audience cheers.]

Guest 6: Attaboy! It's time for some action!

[Taiga walks slowly toward his defeated opponent, but then throws the sword away.]

Saejima: (screams) Shut your fuckin' holes! Which one of you lunatics said killing a guy's no big deal!? Was it you!? Or you!? Ya sit up there chantin "kill, kill, kill." But how many of ya have taken a life with your own two hands!? Fuckin' hyenas. Lemme fill ya in on somethin'. Killin' another man… Watchin' them breathe their last breath… (cries) It's a fuckin' nightmare! Been 25 years since that day... but I still remember it crystal clear. Every night I dream of those 18 guys. My fists bashin' their heads in. The sound of bones crackin'. The screams. The fear on their dyin' faces. I've been relivin' it every single day. N' think about how their families felt. It must've been mortifyin'. But that... That remorse… It's nothin' next to the real horror! Once ya snuff out a life… There's no escapin' the dread of what ya did! Day in, day out, I gotta relive that bloodbath! Any of you got a fuckin' idea what that's like!?! This tournament's a crock o' shit. I'm out.

[He leaves the ring. The Florist watches the whole thing and remains silent.]

Chapter 4: OATH OF BROTHERHOOD
[Taiga leaves the Coliseum in rage.]

The Florist: Hold up.

Saejima: Why?

The Florist: I had a feeling you weren't just another psychopath.

Saejima: The hell does that mean?

The Florist: If you had killed Ivan, I would have denied your request.

Saejima: 'Scuse me?

The Florist: People come here to see blood, but letting my prizefighters murder each other would be bad business. I'm relieved to see there's some humanity left in you.

Saejima: Get to the point.

The Florist: I'll tell you what you want to know: where Sasai is. That "deathmatch" back at the Underground Coliseum? It was a test.

Saejima: What's that s'posed to mean?

The Florist: I wanted to see how you'd act under those circumstances. I hope you don't hold it against me, but it was necessary.

Saejima: ……

The Florist: Relax. Ivan will survive. Hell, he'll be back in the ring in a week at most. But for now, he's in the hospital. That was quite a beating you gave him.

Saejima: Least I know he's alright.

The Florist: Now, as for that request about your patriarch's fate following that incident 25 years ago.

The Florist: After Sasai stepped down in 1985, the Ueno Seiwa Clan put a hit on him, forcing him to go into hiding.

Saejima: ……

The Florist: Several months later, someone brought him down here to Purgatory, but he was barely clinging to life. He's been living on the streets since then.

Saejima: What? You're tellin' me Sasai-san's still alive?

The Florist: Yes. It was all we could do to keep him from dying. He's homeless now, but he's still in Kamurocho.

Saejima: I see.

The Florist: That said...

Saejima: What?

The Florist: He's probably—how shall I say—not the man you remember.

Saejima: Huh?

The Florist: I'll have him brought over right now.

Saejima: Here?

The Florist: Yeah, that's right. Bring him in.

[Florist’s men bring some old homeless that can barely walk or stand on his own.]

Saejima: ……That... That's him?

Sasai: Ngh...

The Florist: Do you know who brought Sasai down here, half dead, a quarter century ago? It was Goro Majima.

Saejima: What!?

The Florist: I can only assume Majima was trying to protect Sasai from the Ueno Seiwa Clan after you were gone.

Sasai: Ah... Ohhh...

Saejima: Sasai-san… Boss? (runs closer) Boss...! Talk to me! (in tears) Boss… It's Saejima. I’m home.

The Florist: There's no point. He doesn't have a shred of consciousness left. No matter what you say... you won't be getting a response.

Saejima: Boss...! It's me! I'm right next to you! Boss!

Sasai: Sa…

Saejima: Boss?

Sasai: Sa...e...ji… Sa...e...ji... ma…

[Taiga sheds a tear.]

Saejima: Boss!

[He hugs Sasai.]

Saejima: How'd it come to this? Why? (loudly) Why?

[Some time passes and Sasai is taken away.]

The Florist: ...Had some time to take it all in?

Saejima: Yeah. I owe ya one. Thanks for lettin' me see him again.

The Florist: A deal's a deal. So, what will you do now?

Saejima: There's one more thing I gotta find out.

The Florist: You mean Majima?

Saejima: Yeah. I gotta know what really happened back in '85. I wanna hear it straight from his mouth. Have I spent half my life behind bars for nothing? I can't go out without knowin'.

The Florist: That reminds me. You broke yourself out of prison, right? It would seem the police are hot on your trail. I heard they got wind of you being sighted in Kamurocho. The city's crawling with cops right now.

Saejima: Shit...

The Florist: You'd better lay low until things calm down. You still have that hideout, don't you?

Saejima: Yep.

The Florist: Then wait it out there for a while. You should be safe from the police as long as you stay underground. You look big enough to handle a manhole cover. Use those to access the sewers and you'll be able to move freely. Right outside here, there's an entrance to an underground passage. It'll take you to one of Kamurocho's manholes. I suggest using those manholes wherever you find them. They'll help you get back to your hideout undetected.

Saejima: Gotcha, thanks.

====Head To The Hideout====
[Taiga returns to the streets of Kamurocho.]

Saejima: (Gotta stay outta the cops' sight till I make it to the hideout...)

Stranger: Hey! Wait, Saejima-san! I just watched you fight! It was impressive how you withstood all that pain! I was moved!

Saejima: Who the hell are ya?

Stranger: Oh, sorry! My name is Sodachi. I run a dojo in the neighborhood. 

Saejima: Well whaddya want with me?

Sodachi: To tell you the truth, I was hoping you could help me with something.

Saejima: Help ya...?

Sodachi: Yes... But let's talk at my dojo. That way you can see it for yourself. It's really close by. Do you have a little time to spare?

Saejima: Fine. But make it quick.

Sodachi: Great! Woohoo! Just follow me and we'll be there in a jiffy!

[They enter the dojo.]

Saejima: Heh. This place ain't bad.

Sodachi: I knew you'd think so! I put all of my hard-earned savings into making it this way. It's always been my dream to run my own dojo.

Saejima: Impressive... But there ain't no one here.

Sodachi: That's the problem... The truth is that I only have one apprentice at the moment.

Saejima: One!? That ain't enough to wash the floor!

Sodachi: Exactly. It's a good location though, and there were a good number of apprentices at first. But everybody quit within days… It's probably my fault because I'm no good...

Saejima: No good...?

Sodachi: Yeah. The truth is, I'm a terrible fighter! I've never even won a single fight! Not even once!

Saejima: Huh!? So how the hell do you train your apprentices?

Sodachi: With my theory on fighting!

Saejima: "Theory" on fightin'...?

Sodachi: That's right. For years, I've been conducting thorough research on how to become a stronger fighter and defeat my opponents.

Sodachi: Nobody can beat me when it comes to theory. I've come this far just by believing in my theory. As long as I follow it, I know I can train a great apprentice... Even if I myself am weak. But, it turns out no apprentice will trust a weak teacher... It's just a matter of time before this dojo is forced to close its doors for good. I've done my best to follow my dream of training a champion, but to no avail...

Saejima: I see... I bet it's hard havin' yer dreams crushed after buildin' such a fine dojo.

Sodachi: Yeah... And that's why I've asked you here today, Saejima-san.

Sodachi: Would you work with me to help train my apprentices?

Saejima: Me...?

Sodachi: Yes. After watching you fight at the Underground Coliseum, I knew you were the one I've been looking for. You're not only a great fighter, but you also show compassion, even to your opponents. I'm sure apprentices will look up to you. Of course, I'll support you the best I can. Please, please, Saejima-san! I can't give up now!

Saejima: Fine. I ain't makin' no promises, but I'll see what I can do.

Sodachi: Thank you! You won't regret it! And now, Saejima-san, I formally welcome you to... Sodachi Dojo!

Guy with Glasses: Hey, Sensei!

Sodachi: Oh, Hide-chan! Perfect timing! Please let me introduce you to Hideo Sugiyama-kun. Hide-chan is my dojo's one and only apprentice.
Sodachi Hide-chan, this is Saejima-san. He'll be teaching here for a while. He's an amazing fighter. And when I say amazing, I mean out of this world amazing!

Sugiyama: Oh, that's great. Nice to meet you. I'm Hideo Sugiyama. But you can call me Hideo. I look forward to being your student!

Saejima: Nice to meet ya.

Sodachi: Now, how about we get to training right away? Our goal is to make Hide-chan the champion of the Rookie Tournament!

Saejima: Rookie Tournament? What the hell's that?

Sodachi: Oh, sorry. I didn't explain that yet, did I? The Coliseum holds regular tournaments that are only open to rookie fighters, with the purpose of finding the next star fighter. Winning the tournament will earn you recognition as a full-fledged fighter and the opportunity to enter other tournaments in the Coliseum. Underground Coliseum fighters are the true cream of the crop. Since the Rookie Tournament is full of rookies who hope to become Underground Coliseum fighters someday, the fights are always fierce.

Saejima: Huh. They didn't have that when I fought.

Sodachi: I heard you were specially nominated. People with astounding strength and a good record are nominated and gain immediate entry.
Sodachi By the way, if you win the Rookie Tournament, both the fighter and the dojo receive prize money. If I had that money, I'm sure that I'd be able to renovate this dojo up quite nicely...

Saejima: I get it. Like killin' two birds with one stone, right?

Sodachi: Exactly! Well, that's enough explaining. Let's get to work!

Sugiyama: I'm looking forward to training with you, Saejima-sensei!

Sodachi: You'll be in charge of arranging the training menu. The menu has four Regular Slots and one Special Slot. These five slots equal one turn. I'll choose the Special Slot for now. You'll be in charge of selecting the Regular Slots. After you're done, press Begin to begin training. I'm sure you'll get the hang of it once you get started. Okay, let's do it! Train your apprentices and have them win the tournament within 50 turns! The sooner they win, the better the prize money and the evaluation. You can earn the most prize money by having your apprentice win within 15 turns. After that, the amount will start to decrease every five turns. Train your apprentices efficiently so they are able to win in as few turns as possible.

Saejima: According to Sodachi's plan, it's time for a meeting with ya. But I ain't the "meeting" type. How's about we do this over drinks?

Sugiyama: Okay! I'd love to!

Sodachi: Sounds great! You can talk over drinks to develop a relationship of trust. This is the fundamental principle of my theory of fighting!

Saejima: Right. Let's go, Hideo.

Sugiyama: Of course!

Sodachi: Huh? Uh... What about me...?

Saejima: ...Huh? Whaddya want?

Sodachi: Oh, nothing! Don't worry about me! Have a good time!

[Taiga and Hideo go to a bar.]

Sugiyama: Aaah... A nice cold beer is the best! Especially after a hard day of training.

Saejima: Got that right. So tell me, why'd you decide to start fightin'?

Sugiyama: The reason I started? Well, it's not a very noble reason, but...

Saejima: Just tell me already.

Sugiyama: I did it to get a girl that I like to notice me.

Saejima: Whaddya talkin' about?

Sugiyama: There's this girl named Mayako-chan that I've had a crush on for a while. She's really cute and sweet… If possible, I'd like to make her my girlfriend. But I'm not very special and I lack confidence. She's sure to say no even if I could ask her.

Saejima: Huh. So ya wanted to get stronger and gain confidence in yerself.

Sugiyama: Exactly. I want to become a man that's worthy to be by her side. I started fighting to gain the confidence to ask her out. It's an impure reason, right?

The reason ain't important. ✓
It ain't impure.
You're pathetic!

Saejima: No. The reason you started ain't important. It's what you do afterwards that counts. Follow through on what ya decide. That's what men do. If you really like that girl, give it everythin' ya got. Show her what you can do.

Sugiyama: Saejima-san... Thank you. I'll train hard so that I can be proud of who I am!

Saejima: (Looks like he's pretty motivated now. Guess I can give some good advice sometimes.)

Sodachi: Welcome back. Did you have a good time? It's important to develop trust, so make sure to take your apprentice out for drinks again sometime. The greater the trust, the more the apprentice listens to you—meaning more efficient training. Try building a good relationship with Hide-chan.

Saejima: That's it for today. I gotta tell ya, teachin's a lot harder than 1 expected.

Sodachi: No worries. You'll get the hang of it in no time. Just keep doing what you're doing!

???: ZZZZZZZ

Saejima: Who's that sleepin' over there? He another one of your apprentices?

Sodachi: Oh... That's Fukushi Ochiai-kun. He doesn't pay the monthly fee, so he isn't an apprentice.

Sodachi: It seems that he just likes it here... He comes by to take naps during the afternoon. But don't worry about him, okay? He isn't a bad guy, but he's definitely not a nice guy, either.

Saejima: (Fukushi Ochiai, huh? Wonder what he wants...)

Sodachi: Well, enough about that. Thank you very much for your time today! Come by to train apprentices whenever you want, just like you did today. We're always here at the dojo, so feel free to stop by anytime. Please! Also, if there's anything you didn't understand, just read the Sodachi Notebook on the bench over there. It'll explain everything.

Saejima: The Sodachi Notebook, huh? Gotcha. I'll read it when I'm havin’ trouble.

Sodachi: All righty, then! See you next time!

[Taiga leaves the dojo.]

Saejima: (Been out here a while now. Best hustle on back to the hideout without the coppers spottin' me.)

[He stumbles upon a policeman…]

Saejima: (A cop on patrol. If he sees me, he's sure to come runnin'. Better move carefully.)

[Taiga has to walk across the rooftops and through the sewers to avoid meeting with the police. On one of the rooftops he meets a familiar face.]

Saejima: Wait, aren't you...

Kamiyama: Uh, hi. I'm Kamiyama. We met in Okinawa, remember? I was able to escape in all the chaos during your prison break.

Saejima: Wait, are they not after you or anything?

Kamiyama: I mean, compared to you, I'm small fry, so nobody's coming after me. Still, I thought I should be careful anyway, so I've decided to stay here for the time being... I'm starting a business on the roof over there. My business is utilizing my expertise to mod equipment. I've still got to get things ready, but come by again soon. ...Um, my little brother is in town, too. He specializes in weapons. Maybe you should stop by and see him, too. I think he set up shop in the far alley by West Park.

[Taiga finds a way to get to his hideout. When he walks inside he sees several battered homeless people and Minami sitting on a table looking at the dirt under his fingernails.]

Homeless: I'm real sorry, Saejima-san. This fella just barged in...

Saejima: Who the hell are you?

Minami: A Majima Family man. Name's Minami. Guessin' you're Saejima-san?

Saejima: The Majima Family? What the fuck do ya want?

Minami: Whoa, down boy. Didn't come here lookin' for a fight. It's just when I came in to say hi, gramps and his lame-ass friends jumped me. So I, ya know...

Saejima: Whaddya want?

Minami: The boss is askin' for ya. Word is you two were bros back in the day.

Saejima: Majima wants to meet?

Minami: Says to stop by the office tomorrow night.

Saejima: Where?

Minami: The Millennium Tower— Y'know, that eyesore scrapin' the sky like it's nobody's business?

Saejima: Fine.

Minami: Knowin' the boss, he's prolly got some fucked up shit waitin' for ya on the top floor. I'd come prepared if I was you.

Saejima: Hey.

Minami: 'Sup?

Saejima: Give a message to Majima. He best have some damn good answers ready. If not, he's gettin' his shit kicked in.

Minami: Heh. Think you can go all medieval on the bossman? No dig, but he'll straight up kill ya. See ya.

Saejima: (Best grab some shuteye before I settle the score tomorrow night. Tonight's the showdown with ol’ Majima.)

Kido: Kamurocho's still swarming with cops, Saejima-san. You can't risk moving aboveground. If you're meeting Minami at the Millennium Tower tonight, then maybe you should rest here until nightfall. In the meantime, I'll go scope out the best route to get you there in one piece.

Saejima: Much obliged.

Kido: Just lemme know when you want to rest up. I'll stay put until then.

Saejima: (Guess I got some time till sundown.)

Kido: You wanna catch some Z's before it gets dark, Saejima-san?

Saejima: Yeah, I think I'll kick back a little.

Kido: Sounds good. I'll go check out the best route for you to get to the Millennium Tower in the meantime. 

[He hits the pillow for a bit.]

Kido: You sure you wanna go, Saejima-san?

Saejima: Yeah. Time to settle the score for all the shit my boss and I've been through since '85.

Kido: 25 years is a long-ass wait, man.

Saejima: You're tellin' me, kid.

Kido: Only one problem. The streets are still swarming with cops. No way you'll make it to the Millennium Tower aboveground.

Saejima: Then how do I get there?

Kido: Take the north side exit to go topside. Then, go underground from the back of the Millennium Tower and exit at the Shichifuku Parking Lot. Next, head to the rooftop from Pink Alley and go a little south before returning to ground level. After that, head south from the ramen shop… Go through the basement parking lot, past the central sewer, and come out a manhole in front of the Millennium Tower.

Saejima: Sounds pretty fuckin' complicated, but I think I got it.

Kido: You'll be fine as long as you can avoid the cops. Sorry, man. Wish I could do more to help.

Saejima: Heh, ya done more than enough. Thanks for everything, Kido.

Kido: You bet.

[Taiga walks to the door.]

Kido: Saejima-san! Before you go. There's one thing I want to know. Do you ever regret what you did? 25 years, wasn't it? I know it was for your boss, but all that hard time had to make you think. Don't you ever wanna take it all back?

Saejima: What're ya askin that for?

Kido: I just had to ask.

Saejima: Huh. Lemme guess, you're plannin' something big yourself. And now you're gettin' cold feet. Regrets, huh? Can't say I don't got 'em. I regret every life these hands stole that day. Eats at my soul nonstop. Still... gettin' sent to the slammer, doin' all that for the boss… I don't regret a speck of that.

Kido: How? How are you that strong, Saejima-san?

Saejima: It ain't strength. I'm just livin' the life me and my bro chose to lead. That's what bein' a yakuza's really about. People think we're criminals or whatever. But every day I'm proud to be part of somethin' bigger. Honor and duty. That's what it all means.

Kido: Saejima-san.

Saejima: If I'd left that day without doin' my duty... Well that betrayal would've gone against everythin' I believe in. That'd really be somethin' to regret. Kido-chan. Ya gotta go balls out. You only get one shot at hittin' it big. So when the time comes for ya to put your life on the line… Givin' it your all's the only way. No lookin' back. No regrets.

Kido: Yes, sir.

Saejima: Good luck out there, kid. Be seein' ya.

[Taiga leaves the hideout. Kido bows.]

====Head to the Millenium Tower====
Saejima: (Go aboveground north of the theater, pass through the parking lot under Nakamichi Street, and exit the manhole in front of the Millennium Tower. Can't let any coppers spot me on my way to the Millennium Tower. Better stick to the underground and the rooftops. The route Kido-chan told me about’s my best bet, long as I keep my eye out for the boys in blue.)

[Taiga walks cautiously through the city using a variety of ways to get around the police. When he enters Millennium Tower, he is met by a hundred yakuza led by Minami.]

Saejima: ……

Minami: Shit, ya actually showed up, Saejima-san!

Saejima: Damn straight.

Minami: Word from the bossman is, if you're who ya say you are, we're all gettin' our asses handed to us.

Saejima: Hmph. This a test, then?

Minami: Yep. And I'm curious what sorta man my boss'd call his bro. Hope ya don't mind if I let loose!

Saejima: Fine by me. Gives me a chance to see what kinda family ol' Majima scraped together. Take your best shot!

Minami: Hey, boys! This dude's sworn brothers with the boss, but that don't mean he gotta win. Shoot to kill! This shit's on!

[Taiga defeats a hundred yakuza and then fights Minami himself. He is cunning and skilled at fighting and even uses blowing fire to keep his opponent from getting close, but thanks to his beast stamina Taiga still defeats him.]

Saejima: Pretty good, bro. Looks like ya raised your boys right,

Minami: Naw. I'm not... fuckin' done yet!

[He tries to get up but the injuries don't let him. The elevator goes down to the first floor.]

Minami: Boss!

Majima: Sorry 'bout the wait. Brother.

Saejima: Majima!

Majima: Guess we got some catchin' up to do. But not here. How ‘bout a little stroll?

[They exit the Millenium Tower. There’s three hundred yakuza outside.]

Yakuzas: (bows) Good to see you, sir!

Majima: The fuzz ain't gettin' near us now. So. Let's roll.

[The people on the streets are shocked. Majima and Saejima just walking through the street encircled by Majima’s men.]

Saejima: Where're you takin' me?

Majima: Our old stompin' grounds.

Saejima: Still there, huh?

[Majima brings Saejima to Yoshida Batting Center.]

Majima: C'mon, clock's tickin'. I could use a few swings.

[They enter the center and Majima walks into a booth.]

Majima: Hit a few for old time's sake?

[He takes a swing.]

Saejima: Majima.

Majima: Huh?

Saejima: Stop playin'. Ya know why I came back, don't ya. 

Majima: To rendezvous with old man Sasai… Oh, and to get your revenge on me.

Saejima: If ya know what I want, why're you fuckin' around like this? I gotta know what went down that day in '85. How come ya never showed n' backed me up!? 

[Majima continues playing. Taiga catches the ball.]

Saejima: Answers, bro. 

[Majima drops the bat and walks to the center of the field.]

Majima: What's the hold up? Get your ass over here. You didn't forget, did ya? What we promised each other. Minute we stepped foot into this world, the deal was sealed. Duty's everythin’. A friend or foe, or even sworn brother. The price for betrayal… Is death. That's the oath we swore the day we became brothers.

Saejima: 'Course I remember. Every damn word of it. 

Majima: Well whatever the reasons betrayed ya. Couldn't help old man Sasai, either.

[He takes his jacket off in one swing, revealing his Demon Tattoo.]

Saejima: Majima..

Majima: Just strip, bro. We're settlin' this like good ol' times. Ya beat my ass, I talk. Gonna need a boatload of luck for that though!

Saejima: So ya think I gone soft.

[He also takes his military style jacket off, revealing the Tiger Tattoo.]

Majima: Thank god. I was half expectin' ya to be all flab.

Saejima: Wouldn't have survived all these years without a way to fight back. You're the one livin' it easy.

Majima: (pulls out his tanto) Then I guess I don't gotta pull any punches.

Saejima: Least we agree on that.

Majima: Let's do this, brother!

[And they have the fateful fight that has been looming over them for years and years. After some time of fierce fighting, Majima falls to his knees.]

Saejima: What's wrong, bro? No gas left in the tank? You goin' down that easy!?

[Taiga swings in for the final blow, but stops a millimeter from Majima's face and falls to the floor. Majima falls next to him. They panting heavily.]

Saejima: Hey, bro…

Majima: Yeah?

Saejima: You n' me... We've changed.

Majima: Ya don't say.

Saejima: We used to burn so damn bright. But now, all these years… It's turned us into a pair o' farts. Least now ya can keep up the Kansai act.

Majima: What, you startin' shit again?

Saejima: Relax. Gotta say, though. This ain't how I remember ya. You used to be a hundred times stronger than that. 'Sup with that shit on your eye, anyway? That's what's holdin' ya back?

Majima: Ain't got nothin' to do with it. Been carryin' this burden, 25 years now.

Saejima: Since '85?

Majima: Damn straight. The same day old man Sasai n’ I lost you… That's when my peeper went, too.

Saejima: What?

[Majima takes his eyepatch to show Taiga he really lost his eye.]

Majima: So, yeah. That's the thick of it. Dunno, seein' 20/20 prolly did help. Don't feel half as tough just seein' 20, y’know? But hey, wouldn’t be fair if I didn't have a teensy handicap!

Saejima: Brother. That eye o' yours. Ya lose it on my account? You get mixed up in somethin’? Is that why ya didn't show? Tell me the truth, bro. That day, back in '85… What kept ya from comin' to help?

Majima: That whole Ueno Seiwa hit… Far as I can tell, it was all just a setup.

Saejima: Ya ain't sure?

Majima: Not 100 percent. No way of findin' out now, though.

Saejima: Why's that?

Majima: The guy I'm bettin' was behind it… He ain't ever gonna talk again.

Saejima: Huh? Who?

Majima: Shibata. Kazuo Shibata. If I'm right... me, you, old man Sasai. He's the one who left us all to hang.

[PART 2 COMPLETE]

==PART 3 PROLOGUE==
April 21st 1985
In an abandoned warehouse…

Young Majima: Mind tellin' me why ya dragged me all the way out here?

Young Shibata: Heh. Your Kansai accent's gotten much better since I last saw you. I hear you've been hard at work. Now I see why Shimano-san's taken an interest in you.

Young Majima: So ya gonna tell me what this is about or not, Shibata-han?

Young Shibata: You're all dressed up today. Going to a funeral?

Young Majima: Nah... Nothin' like that.

Young Shibata: Come to think of it, Sasai's boy Saejima was in his finest this morning, too.

Young Majima: And? What if he was?

Young Shibata: I'll skip right to the point. The Yoshiharu Ueno hit's going down today… but you're not going to be there, Majima.

Young Majima: Huh!? How did ya...

Young Shibata: You and Saejima plan to ambush Ueno today, at a ramen joint en route home from prison. Is that correct? (Majima is silent) Well, there's been a slight change of plans. You know how it is.

Young Majima: The hell are you talking about?

Young Shibata: Patriarch Dojima doesn't think it's in our best interest to stamp out the Ueno Seiwa Clan just yet. 

Young Majima: What? Why?

Young Shibata: No need to get excited. The Dojima Family is simply asking you to follow orders.

Young Majima: C'mon, Shibata-han, gimme a reason here.

Young Shibata: The hit on Yoshiharu Ueno was a Dojima Family idea originally. It began as a bid to expand their turf here in the city. They left its execution to the Sasai Family. This much you already know, yes?

Young Majima: Yeah. That's why it's me from the Dojima Family and Saejima on loan from Patriarch Sasai's place.

Young Shibata: That's right. But doesn't this whole scenario seem more than a little strange to you?

Young Majima: Whaddya mean?

Young Shibata: How'd the Tojo find out? How did we learn Ueno would be heading straight for a ramen shop immediately after his release? And let me ask you this. After being locked away for two years, would a chairman's first meal be noodles? The Ueno Seiwa Clan ought to be throwing a lavish celebration in honor of his release.

Young Majima: Yeah, but…

Young Shibata: The whole thing stinks. It's likely the entire thing was planned by a traitor in Chairman Ueno's ranks.

Young Majima: A traitor?

Young Shibata: It's a tiny, cramped noodle shop at the edge of town. Would a top yakuza head straight from prison to a spot that practically begs for an ambush?

Young Majima: So why is he, then?

Young Shibata: I suspect this scenario was authored by two traitors. One from the Ueno Seiwa Clan, another from the Tojo.

Young Majima: Two of ‘em?

Young Shibata: Yes. A mole on the inside to leak Ueno's plans… And another to pass that news along to us. In other words, one traitor in the Ueno Seiwa Clan, and one traitor from within the Tojo Clan.

Young Majima: We know who they are?

Young Shibata: The Tojo Clan traitor, yes… Hideki Sasai. He's the one who procured the tip, and his man Taiga Saejima is on his way to perform the hit. The Sasai Family's patriarch received the info, so... 

Young Majima: Saejima's boss? Sasai-san?

Young Shibata: Sasai has ties to the Ueno Seiwa Clan. He told the Tojo Clan where Ueno would be and urged the brass to authorize a hit. 

Young Majima: But why? 

Young Shibata: To start a war. 

Young Majima: What?

Young Shibata: Sasai's creating a reason for the Tojo to strike the Ueno Seiwa Clan hard. And what better way is there than to anger the Ueno Seiwa Clan enough to declare war?

Young Majima: What's he stand to gain outta all this? 

Young Shibata: Good question. All I know is Ueno's death would give his clan ample enough reason to declare war on us. After all, it will have been the Tojo Clan that struck the first blow. No doubt Sasai will work with the Ueno Seiwa traitor to contain the situation. By playing peacemaker, he'll be on his way to becoming a top figure in the Tojo Clan. Make sense? So you see, Majima, we can't have a Dojima Family member like you getting mixed up in all of this. Join this hit and you'll cause problems for Patriarch Dojima, and for Shimano-san. 

[Majima stands silent.]

Young Shibata: Majima-san? Are you even listening to me?

[Majima pushes Shibata against the wall.]

Young Majima: (in rage) My bro's already headin' over! Ya expect me to just sit on my hands here!?

Young Shibata: Majima-san!

Young Majima: You sayin' I should knife my boy in the back!? Do nothin' while he goes on a suicide mission!?

Young Shibata: Please, calm down!

Young Majima: I'm goin'. You and your plan can suck it. I’m not leavin' the only brother I've ever had to die.

Young Shibata: Majima-san. You won't make it out alive, either.

Young Majima: The flyin' fuck I care about that!? I been ready to toss my life away ever since I swore my oath.

Young Shibata: Is that so? Then I guess I don't have a choice. Boys!

[A dozen yakuza enter.]

Young Shibata: I was hoping we could keep this peaceful. Shame.

Young Majima: Shibata!

Young Shibata: Make yourself nice and cozy. This'll be your home for a while.

Young Majima: (sreams) Shibata!

[Some time passes. Some of the yakuza lie dead on the concrete floor. Majima is chained to an iron pole. A young yakuza with a piece of pipe in his hands stands in front of him.]

Yakuza: Man, you're a real beast. Up against all these guys… And you're still trying to play hero!?

[He pokes Majima in the stomach with his pipe. Majima spits in his face.]

Yakuza: You got a pair, I'll give you that. Makes sense they'd pick you for a hit. (grabs a knife) But listen. The boss only gave us two orders: keeping you holed up in here… And making sure your ass didn't croak. Basically. Free to keep you in line however I damn well please. Even if it's gotta get ugly. Like, say… If you ended up losing an eye. Or maybe even two. Now, say you're sorry. Cry like a little baby.

Young Majima: Can't do that.

Yakuza: What?

Young Majima: I only grovel to my boss. Or someone I respect. Not some fuckin' pissant.

Yakuza: Then I'm real sorry. But I think you know what happens next.

Young Majima: Rather go blind than bow down to you, bitch!

Yakuza: Oh yeah? If you say so!

[He cuts out Majima’s right eye.]

PART 3: MASAYOSHI TANIMURA
Chapter 1: THE KAMUROCHO PARASITE
March 8th, 12:00 PM

[Sugiuchi interrogates Tanimura in the police station.]

Sugiuchi: Answer me! The day of that murder... What were you doing at Sky Finance!? Your goddamn prints were all over the stiff's chin! You ever hear of putting on gloves!? Hey, jackoff. You listening to a word I'm saying? I asked you a question, dammit!

Tanimura: Yes... Come on!

[He listens to the sport broadcast through a small earpiece. Sugiuchi notices this and takes out the earpiece.]

Sugiuchi: You got a screw loose, kid? You little…

Tanimura: Oh?

Sugiuchi: What do you got piping in there!? Seriously? This look like time for horse racing? They don't let you pull this shit over in Community Safety, do they?

Tanimura: Hey, let's not blow up over nothing. Now we done here? I have places to be.

Sugiuchi: Oh, you're busy, huh? Listen up, Tanimura.

Tanimura: What now?

Sugiuchi: I've got a little tip for you. Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong. All you'll find is an early grave. Just like your old man.

[Tanimura looks at Sugiuchi’s shoes.]

Sugiuchi: What? Looking at something?

Tanimura: Nah, not really. Thanks for the pointer.

Sugiuchi: Where are you going?

Tanimura: On patrol, duh. That's what Community Safety's all about remember?

Sugiuchi: Not sure where the safety comes in. Last I heard your patrols “are nothing more an shaking down illegal business for hush money.”

Tanimura: Huh. My reputation precedes me. I’m out.

[Tanimura comes out of the interrogation room.]

Sugiuchi: Parasite.

[In the corridor, Tanimura is caught up by a funny and clumsy old man who turns out to be the chief of police.]

Chief Hisai: Tanimura-kun, wait! Tanimura-kun! Phew, glad I caught you.

Tanimura: Hey, what's up, Chief?

Chief Hisai: Is that all you have to say? You went to a mahjong parlor during your patrol yesterday. That's “what's up”!

Tanimura: Hmm... I did?

Chief Hisai: This isn't a joke! Please, don't gamble while you're on duty. I shouldn't have to remind you.

Tanimura: Okay, all right...

Chief Hisai: Look, someone called in saying you took them for tens of thousands of yen. What do I say to that?

Tanimura: Who'd you say called that in?

Chief Hisai: I didn't! I can only imagine what you'd do to the poor fellow if I did!

Tanimura: ……

Chief Hisai: Anyway, think of the position you're putting me in here. What would I say to your father, letting you run amok like this? I should mention I risked my neck pulling you into Community Safety. Have you ever considered that?

Tanimura: (bows) Yeah, you're right... Sorry.

Chief Hisai: At least make an effort to stay on track, all right?

===Find the Informant====
[Tanimura goes outside.]

Tanimura: (Okay, now to find whoever ratted me out to the force. Orchid Palace Mahjong 's a good place to start.)

[He enters the mahjong parlor.]

Tanimura: Excuse me.

Owner: Oh, Tanimura-san! Here to play mahjong again today?

Tanimura: No, not today. Can you tell me which members were here in the shop when I was playing here yesterday?

Owner: Hmm, well, there was one person I wasn't familiar with. They were probably someone who came here for the first time yesterday. The other members were those two regulars, who are playing over there.

Tanimura: Oh, that's right. I remember now. Thanks.

Owner: You're very welcome... Did something happen?

Tanimura: It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

Owner: …Well, all right.

[Tanimura walks to a table with some young man on it playing mahjong.]

Tanimura: Hey, you got a minute?

Young Man: Oh, Tanimura-san. Back to do some more damage?

Tanimura: No, I'm here to find a snitch, and it better not be you.

Young Man: Snitch? What are you talking about?

Tanimura: Save it. The chief said someone filed a complaint about yesterday.

Young Man: C'mon, Tanimura-san. That wasn't the first time I lost a major chunk of change to you. If I was gonna snitch, I would've done it a long time ago. Plus, I don't even want to know what you'd do to me if I did. Right?

Student: For sure. I can always earn back the cash you rolled me for. The damage you do would probably be a lot more permanent.

Tanimura: You got that right.

Student: Oh, but what about that other guy at the table? I wouldn't be surprised if he did it.

Young Man: Yeah, he seemed like he was hurting for money. Bet he was hurting even more after you dropped in and steamrolled us.

Tanimura: Huh… So where is he now?

Student: Oh, he's, uh...

Young Man: Wait a second!

Tanimura: What?

Young Man: Tanimura-san. Tell me if I'm wrong, but this isn't official police business, is it? So why should we give away this information for free?

Student: Hey, you're right! This is the perfect chance to recoup some of our losses from yesterday!

Tanimura: Aw, come on, guys...

Young Man: Well? What's it gonna be?

Tanimura: All right, fine. Name your price.

Young Man: I won't ask much. Like I said, I don't have a death wish. How about two silver plates? They give those out as prizes here, so that should be simple enough.

Tanimura: You really wanna stick it to me that bad, huh... Fine, silver plates it is.

Young Man: Heheh. Thanks, officer. We just want to win something for once, so I don't care how you get them. Easiest way is to win or buy enough mahjong sticks and exchange 'em at the prize counter. Probably.

Owner: Hey, I heard you're in need of some prizes.

Tanimura: Yeah, two silver plates... Can you give them to me?

Owner: Sorry, no can do. However, you can get them by exchanging sticks, so you can either win a few games of mahjong, or buy the sticks yourself. However, you can get them by exchanging sticks, so you can either win a few games of mahjong, or buy the sticks yourself.

Tanimura: Hmm...

Owner: Oh, now that I think of it, Tanimura-san, the shop next door sells fake silver plates... Whatever do they use them for?

[Tanimura thinks for a while…]

Owner: Hey, boss. Would you like to exchange your winnings for prizes or purchase mahjong sticks? Or would you like to participate in the Genbu Cup?

Exchange Sticks for Prizes
Buy Mahjong Sticks ✓
Play a Genbu Cup Match
Never Mind

Owner: You need mahjong sticks to play mahjong. How much you lookin' to buy? It's 1 yen a stick.

100,000 Sticks
25,000 sticks ✓
10,000 sticks
Never Mind

Tanimura: I'll take 25.000 sticks.

Owner: Thank you very much. Have fun!

[Tanimura buys 2 Silver Plates and returns to the young man.]

Young Man: Hey, Tanimura-san. You get those two silver plates yet?

Tanimura: Yeah, got 'em right here.

You handed over 2 Silver Plate.

Young Man: Nice. I'll be taking those off your hands, thank you very much. Okay, so the other guy at the table yesterday? His name's Iida.

Student: Yup, thafs your guy. Can't say we know him that well, but we do see him around every so often.

Young Man: He mentioned he didn't have a... traditional job, per se, but he works at the Shichifuku Parking Lot.

Tanimura: Oh, the one over on Shichifuku and Senryo?

Student: Yup, that's the one. Now, I don't know what he does over there, but he did say that's where he makes his mahjong money... So I guess he must be doing something right.

Tanimura: 'Kay. That's all I need to know.

Young Man: Oh, but be warned: he was super pissed after you left yesterday. Said you weren't gonna get away with what you did and other crazy stuff.

Student: Yeah, he was kinda freaking out, honestly.

Young Man: He's a pretty big dude, too. Wouldn't want to be in his way when he's mad.

Young Man: Anyway, that's pretty much all we got on him.

Tanimura: That's more than enough. Guess I'll swing by the Shichifuku Parking Lot and pay our friend Iida a little visit... See if he's the guy who narc'd on me.

Young Man: Yikes, sucks to be him. Anyway, come back again and give us another shot at you, yeah? It's only fair.

Tanimura: Haha, sure. Happy to take your money anytime.

[He finds a gathering in the Parking Lot.]

Tanimura: Hey, you.

Man: What's this? A challenger? Finally, someone around here who actually has some balls! I go by "Mr. Try and Hit Me." The job's in the name: Hit me in under a minute and you get 50,000 yen. Only costs three grand to play. Wanna give it a shot?

Tanimura: Hell no. Do I not look familiar to you?

Mr. Try and Hit Me: ...Oh shit! You're that mahjong monster!

Tanimura: Bingo. Now look, I have some questions for you. Got a few moments?

Iida: Nope, don't know nothin'! And I definitely didn't rat you out to your superior officer, either, so why don't ya scurry on back to donut patrol!

Tanimura: ...You're not very bright, are you? But thanks for saving both of us the time. Now's the part where I teach you a lesson for being such a sore loser.

Iida: Hahaha... Go ahead and try! Can't touch this, baby!

Tanimura: ...You gotta be kidding me.

Iida: It ain't no joke, jackass! They used to call me the Artful Dodger back in the day, 'cause my footwork alone is a masterpiece! So get ready, 'cause for the very first time in Kamurocho history, Mr. Try and Hit Me's gonna try and hit you! This is gonna be some groundbreaking shit right here!

Tanimura: Yeah, good luck with that. I'll be handing you your ass in under a minute.

Iida: You think you're hot shit, huh? All right then, game on!

[Tanimura knocks Iida out in 20 seconds. The crowd, displeased by the fight, dissolves.]

Iida: Shit!

Tanimura: How about it? Want to try again?

Iida: ……Sorry for ratting you out. I won't do it again.

Tanimura: Damn right, you won't. Why'd you do it in the first place?

Iida: Well, it's like this. I've been living as Mr. Try and Hit Me for years here in Kamurocho. But there's this one scary-looking guy in a gray suit who challenges me to a fight every year. And every year I end up losing. Each time, I train harder before fighting him again, but I can't seem to beat him. So I started playing mahjong to take my mind off it, but I ended up getting hooked. Turns out, I'm pretty damn good. But just when I started thinking mahjong might be a good way to make a living, you had to come along and spoil the fun. I lost a shitload of money to you! So I was pretty pissed, what with the Mr. Try and Hit Me thing and the mahjong thing going all to hell. So I picked up the phone and... yeah. Anyway, I'm ready to suffer the consequences. Do your worst, I don't care!

Tanimura: Eh, I'm over it.

Iida: What!?

Tanimura: I'm saying you're free to go. After all, it's not like you're still out to get me. And besides, I got a few good punches in. Let's just call it even.

Iida: Oh, uh... okay. Thanks, pal.

Tanimura: Just watch it. Rat me out again, and you won't get off so easy.

Iida: Yes, sir! I wouldn't dream of it!

Tanimura: (Right. Well, at least I got to work out some aggression.)

Police Scanner: Incoming message from HQ: report of fighting at Theater Square. Officers in the vicinity, head to crime scene.

Tanimura: I swear, petty incidents like this never end. I guess it's close by. I'll have a look.

Defeated Businessman: Sorry!

Indignant Punk: Shut up, bitch! You're the one that started this, and now you just wanna back out!? You owe me money!

Tanimura: All right, that's enough. I'll let this one slide if you disappear—and quick.

Indignant Punk: Huh? You got a problem? Maybe I'll just kick your ass and collect what I deserve from you instead!

[Tanimura beats the punk up.]

Scared Punk: Agh... Ugh... You're no joke. Who the hell are you, anyways?

Tanimura: I'm Tanimura, a detective here in Kamurocho.

Scared Punk: Shit! Fuckin' cops...

Tanimura: Watch your mouth and get the hell out of here. Arresting punks like you is a waste of my time.

Scared Punk: Right! Consider me gone!

Defeated Businessman: (bows) Thank you. You saved me.

Tanimura: No worries. I was just passing by, don't think too much of it. But you should watch your step from here on out.

Defeated Businessman: Yes, sir. I apologize for the trouble. I'll be more careful in the future.

Tanimura: Whew... That takes care of that.

Akaishi: Looks like you cleaned that up quite nicely!

Tanimura: And you are?

Akaishi: Oh, I apologize. I am Akaishi, here representing the Kamurocho Guard.

Tanimura: Kamurocho Guard? Oh, that volunteer group doing a community watch type of thing?

Akaishi: You know us! Well, it's nice to meet you, Tanimura-san.

Tanimura: Huh? How did you know my name?

Akaishi: Working in the area has made me really knowledgeable about the local police. And boy, have I heard a lot about you!

Tanimura: I'm almost certain it's nothing good.

Akaishi: Anyways, nice work back there. You resolved the situation by being the first on the scene and handled things expediently.

Tanimura: I just came by because I was in the area and heard about it on my radio.

Akaishi: Our group gives its all to maintain the peace here in Kamurocho. But with a pleasure district this big, even our combined efforts can't cover all the problems that arise.

Tanimura: That's for sure.

Akaishi: Plus, and I'm not sure why, there's been some mystery group trying to interfere with us lately. The nature of our work requires we put ourselves in harm's way. But now we have people actively working against us. Our ranks are thinning.

Tanimura: Hm. that's not good at all.

Akaishi: Which is why I have a favor to ask you. Would you mind lending us a hand?

Tanimura: Huh? Keeping the peace is technically my job, but I don't think I can just up and join your group.

Akaishi: You won't have to actually join, just help out once in a while. Our goal is to resolve incidents like the one you just dealt with. We want to make Kamurocho safer for everyone.  To do that we need the assistance of police like you, that know much more than we do about the area. We will use our funds to reward you, depending on how many incidents you are able to resolve. This isn't easy for me to say, but... we've heard rumors you were financially in need pretty often. Anyways, we will pay you a fair amount for your services. Do we have a deal?

Tanimura: Hmm. One thing bugs me...

Akaishi: What is it?

Tanimura: Well, you said you guys are volunteers, right?

Akaishi: That's right.

Tanimura: Then what's this about funds I'm hearing?

Akaishi: Huh?

Tanimura: Volunteer groups usually just barely scrape by. That is, unless they have some strong organization backing them.

Akaishi: Well...

Tanimura: If you can't say, that's fine, I guess. Not like I have anything to lose.

Akaishi: Thank you, Tanimura-san! You can come by and help whenever you have the time! We won't force you to do anything you don't want to!

Tanimura: All right. But only when I hear something on the radio and have some spare time.  

Akaishi: Really!? Thank you very much!

Tanimura: So I go to you for the reward money, yeah?

Akaishi: Yes. I am usually here, at Theater Square. Contact me once you've resolved a couple cases.

Tanimura: You don't mind me collecting a bit on the side from the people I help, right?

Akaishi: ...I have no issues with that.

Tanimura: Roger that.

Akaishi: (bows) This is going to be such a big help! Thanks again!

Tanimura: (Well, as long as they are working for the benefit of Kamurocho. It won't hurt to help out.)

[His phone’s ringing.]

Tanimura: Hello?

Zhao: Hey, Ma-chan. I've run into a little problem here. Would you mind stopping by the restaurant?

Tanimura: Okay, be right there.

Zhao: Thanks. See you in a bit.

Tanimura: (I wonder what Zhao's gotten mixed up in now? The easiest way to Zhao's place, Homeland, is to cut in from East Taihei Boulevard.)

====Head to Homeland====
[He goes to the Homeland through narrow streets. A lot of Chinese are leaving there. Tanimura walks into a restaurant and finds a man there.]

Tanimura: Hey. How's business?

Man: Not again, Tanimura-san.

[He hands Tanimura a roll of cash.]

Tanimura: Always a pleasure.

Man: That's twice now. I thought we agreed once a month. Give me a break.

Tanimura: That girl you just got in. She Korean? Exchange student, maybe? Everyone knows it's illegal for foreigners to work here without a proper visa. But what you might not know is, knowingly hiring them's a crime in itself. Getting caught will cost you 3 years. Well, either that or 3 mil.

Man: Just cut me some slack here.

Tanimura: Rumor has it you take advantage of these girls knowing full well they can't run to the cops. You want me turning a blind eye to that? Eh, we can handle that later. For now, let me know if you ever see this woman. (shows a picture)

Man: Who is she?

Tanimura: Can't say. Police confidentiality, you know. Just call me if you see her. Bye now.

[Tanimura leaves the restaurant and walks through narrow streets littered with Chinese mobs.]

Prostitute: There's my little Ma-chan!

Child: 呀 哥哥 ! (Ooh, it's the cop man!)

Tanimura: 你們好嗎? (What's up, big guy?) 改天再陪你們玩 (Catch you tomorrow, okay?)

[He walks into Homeland restaurant. A girl with a bunch of plates in her hands notices him.]

Waiter: 啊阿正 (Oh, Ma-chan!)

Tanimura: 晦趙在裡頭嗎? (Hey, Zhao hiding back there?)

Waiter: 是啊 (Yup.)

[Tanimura enters the office. A fat guy speaking on the phone. Tanimura sits on the couch and lights a cigarette.]

Zhao: 朴被強制遣返!?孩子怎麼辦? (Park got deported? What about his kid?) 是嗎? (Got it.) 聰明白了我來照顧孩子 (Yeah, that's fine, I'll take her here.) 嗯別擔心 (Sure, don't worry.)

Tanimura: Another joining the ranks?

Zhao: Yeah. Her dad just got sent back to Korea.

Tanimura: What happened?

Zhao: Traffic accident. Happened a few days ago. The cops picked him up and noticed he'd overstayed his visa.

Tanimura: Tough break.

Zhao: The kid's only five, too. No place for her to go but here.

Tanimura: This should cover some of the expenses.

[He puts the roll of cash he got from the trafficker.]

Zhao: Prize winnings? Or let me guess, another shakedown?

Tanimura: Honest? A bit of both.

Zhao: I really can't believe you sometimes. Still, I should be thanking you, too. Just don't do anything stupid. (puts the money in a vase) So what kept you today? I thought you'd be here earlier.

Tanimura: This detective, Sugiuchi-san, was grilling me back at the station. Ever since that shooting, Homicide's been all up in my ass.

Zhao: Hah, police questioning police? That's ridiculous.

Tanimura: Yeah, normally I wouldn't give a damn... But apparently, this wasn't just one random punk killing another. It was significant enough to set the Tojo Clan against itself. ...Although why Homicide cares so much about mob activity is beyond me. That's what Organized Crime's for.

Zhao: Either way, we don't need another gang war in this city...

Tanimura: Oh, and it's not just the Tojo Clan. I hear the Ueno Seiwa's involved.

Zhao: Ueno Seiwa? Wait, isn't that...?

Tanimura: Yeah. The same clan my dad was investigating after the Yoshiharu Ueno hit... Right around when he was murdered.

Zhao: ...You think this is connected somehow?  

Tanimura: Can't say. All I know is the Ueno Seiwa Clan's been quiet for 25 years... But now there's this shooting a week ago, and suddenly they've gone into overdrive? Something's definitely up. Following this case could lead me to someone who knows the truth... about who killed my dad.

Zhao: You still looking for that woman?

Tanimura: Yeah, Yasuko Saejima. Her brother Taiga's the one who carried out the hit on Ueno. She's been missing ever since that went down.

Zhao: And you really think this Yasuko Saejima knows why your father was killed?

Tanimura: Maybe, maybe not. But the last thing written in his notebook was, “Meet with Yasuko Saejima.” That has to mean something.

Zhao: So she might even be the last person who saw him alive...

Tanimura: ……

[His phone’s ringing.]

Manager of Midori: Is this Tanimura?

Tanimura: Yeah, speaking.

Manager of Midori: This is Park, the manager at Midori.

Tanimura: Midori? Oh, right, the Korean salon. What do you want?

Manager of Midori: Can you come here as soon as possible?

Tanimura: Why, the police raiding the place or something?

Manager of Midori: No, nothing like that. It's about that woman you've been looking for. Someone who looks just like her is here right now.

Tanimura: Are you serious!?

Manager of Midori: That's why I'm calling! Hurry up, before she leaves.

Tanimura: Okay, be right there.

Zhao: Something wrong?

Tanimura: I knew it. That killing set something in motion. Zhao-san. I think I found her.

Zhao: Wait, the woman we were just talking about!?

Tanimura: I don't know if it's really her, but I've got no reason to doubt it.

Zhao: I see. Then I suggest you be careful.  

Tanimura: You think?

Zhao: I'm serious. You're telling me this woman shows up out of nowhere, right as the Ueno Seiwa make their biggest ruckus in 25 years? The timing's too perfect.

Tanimura: So you're saying she's involved somehow.

Zhao: Well, you're about to find out. aren't you? Now go. Find her before she disappears again.

Tanimura: Right.

[He leaves Zhao’s office.]

Mei Hua (Waiter): You off and running already, Ma-chan?

Tanimura: Yep, business as usual. You know how it is.

Mei Hua: Let us know if you need anything, okay? You know you're always welcome here. After all, we couldn't be called Homeland if we weren't your home away from home!

Tanimura: That's sweet, Mei Hua. Thank you.

You now have access to a hideout. Here you can save your game, move items to the item box, reminisce on past events, and view your play stats. Furthermore. your health will recover while at a hideout.

Tanimura: (I wonder if the woman at Midori is the same one I've been looking for.)

====Head to Midori====
Manager of Midori: Ah, it’s you, sir! The lady you're looking for is inside.

Tanimura: Okay, can you get her for me?

Manager of Midori: Sure... I mean I would, but... Ah, it's a bit complicated.

Tanimura: What, is she busy or something?

Manager of Midori: No. she's free... It's just...

Tanimura: Spit it out already.

Manager of Midori: Well, I… Hah... I realize I'm actually in a pretty awkward position here. But if this woman really is the one you're looking for, then uh...

Tanimura: Yes?

Manager of Midori: Could you, maybe... figure out a way to skip next month's inspection?

Tanimura: ……

Manager of Midori: A bunch of new workers from Korea just arrived, you see, and another raid would ruin us!

Tanimura: ……

Manager of Midori: I’m begging you! Think of all the good I'm doing for these people!

Tanimura: Uh-huh. Then I guess it wouldn't kill you to pay them right.

Manager of Midori: Huh?

Tanimura: I'm saying you need to give these girls the money they deserve. Don't just skim off the top 'cause you think no one's watching. Because someone is. Treat your workers with respect, and make sure they earn a decent living. Do that, and I'll see what I can do about the inspection. Maybe we can even be civil.

Manager of Midori: Understood! It'll happen just as you said. You have my word!

Tanimura: Okay then. Lees see who you found.

[He waits at the door. Yasuko Saejima more familiar to us as Lily walks out...]

Yasuko: Um… The manager said you wanted to see me about something...?

Tanimura: Incredible. Some people hardly change. Even after 25 years.

Yasuko: Excuse me?

Tanimura: I've been looking for you. For a long, long time.

[He pulls out a photo of young Yasuko and shows it to her.]

Tanimura: You're Yasuko Saejima, right?

Yasuko: Huh!?

Tanimura: There's something I need to know about a shooting in 1985. Something only you can tell me.

Yasuko: I… I don't know about any shooting!

Tanimura: Hey, don't be so tense. You can trust me. (shows her the badge)

Yasuko: Ah! I told you, I don't know anything!

Tanimura: Whoa, what's wrong? I'm one of the good guys here!

Shibata Family Member: We finally got you, you little hussy!

Yasuko: You're... Shibata's men!

Tanimura: Probably his bottom-rung goons, by the look of it.

Shibata Family Member: What, you ditch that moneygrubber for this dickhead? Not that I give a rat's ass. You still owe our boss a visit. Now you're coming with us. We've wasted too much time on you already.

Tanimura: Sorry, but the lady and I have business to discuss. So why don't you buzz off?

Shibata Family Member: You think we take orders from you!? Should've watched that mouth, pretty boy! 'Cause it's about to get swollen shut!

[Tanimura kicks their asses.]

Tanimura: (Geez... What a waste of time. What the heck? She's gone!) Hey! Your people took her somewhere, didn't they!?  

Shibata Family Member: Ha! What do you care? She's probably popping bottles with the oss right now... Or popping his bottle, perhaps.

Tanimura: Stop feeding me bullshit and tell me where she is!

Shibata Family Member: Heh... Heheh... Fine. Guess we bought 'em enough time. They're probably at the Tokyo Bay docks by now. Really, though, I wonder what they're doing to her... Nothing good, knowing the boss.

Tanimura: Damn it! (I need to get to the docks right away... Better catch a cab!)

====Find Yasuko====
Panicking Man: Where the hell is he? We can't wait any longer, yo.

Angry Man: What's holdin' him up? He won't even answer his frickin' phone.

Panicking Man: Psh. At this rate, it'd be quicker to just find some random guy on the street and have him go with us.

Angry Man: I'm with you, man. He's gotta at least as good-looking as us. Hopefully even moreso.

Panicking Man: Let’s see… Good-looking... Hey, how that guy?

Tanimura: …Hm?

Angry Man: No way! That dude looks way too good. Did you forget the whole of this party!?

Panicking Man: Well, you said "good-looking," so…

Tanimura: You two talking about me?

Angry Man: Uh! Well, er, the thing is... Hahaha...

Panicking Man: The truth is, we're on our way to a mixer and one of the guys didn't show. So we're looking for someone else to go in his place.

Tanimura: A mixer? You mean one of those group-date parties?

Panicking Man: Yeah. My friend here is the one who arranged everything. It was supposed to be three guys and three girls, but now we're short one guy.

Angry Man: Yeah, so that's whats up. You, uh, wouldn't mind joining us, would you?  

Tanimura: Me?

Angry Man: Yeah! All you gotta do is come chow down and knock some brews with us for a couple hours. Everything's totally on us—heck, well even slip you some extra cash!

Panicking Man: (Yusuke, are you sure? I thought you said he was too good-looking?)

Angry Man: (Dude, who cares! We're out of time here. What other choice do we have!?) So how about it, man? Down to mix it up with us and a couple of fine young ladies?

Tanimura: I guess there are worse ways to kill time... All right, fine. I'll tag along.

Panicking Man: For real!? Wow, thanks, man!

Angry Man: Well, we're running out of time. so let me explain real quick.

Yusuke: I'm Yusuke, and I arranged this get-together. This here's Naoya, and the guy who flaked out on us like a total bitch is Ryota. Oh, mind if we ask your name?

Tanimura: Sure. Masayoshi Tanimura.

Yusuke: Masayoshi Tanimura...san. All right then. The only thing is. we already told the girls our names, and iVd be kind of awkward to try and change one of them now.

Tanimura: Yeah, huh.

Yusuke: So would you be cool with us calling you 'Ryota• at the party?

Tanimura: It might get a little confusing, but I guess I can handle that.

Naoya: Yusuke, aren't you gonna tell him?

Yusuke: About what?

Naoya: About not hooking up with Akino-chan, of course!

Yusuke: Whoa, hey, dude! That's not even what I... Look, forget about Akino-chan! We're just here to have fun, all right!?

Naoya: Bullshit we are! What are you gonna do if this guy and Akino-chan hit it off? It could happen, you know!

Yusuke: Yeah... You're right. Man, just picturing it in my head makes me feel depressed...

Tanimura: Is there a particular girl you're after?

Naoya: Yeah. That’s actually the whole point of this little mixer today.

Tanimura: Oh, okay. I get it now.

Naoya: Do you think you could help Yusuke get closer to Akino-chan This sonuvabitch is super desperate, so I'm sure he'll return the favor somehow if everything works out!

Naoya: Come on, Yusuke! Don't make me do all the talking!

Yusuke: Please! Help a brother out!

Tanimura: Hah, how can I say no to that? All right, so tell me about this girl, Akino.

Naoya: She's the organizer on the girls' side. She's really outspoken, but she has her quirks, too.

Yusuke: She says she hates strong-smelling food, but she really likes garlicky gyoza. And she likes sweet cocktails, but gets tipsy pretty quick...

Naoya: ...But if you try to be nice and get her a soft drink, shell pretty much chew your head off!

Tanimura: Okay... What about the other two?

Yusuke: Well, their names are Haruko-chan and Konatsu-chan, but this is the first time we're meeting them. So who knows.  

Naoya: If you're into either one of them, feel free to have at it.

Tanimura: What, you're not interested?

Naoya: Me? Nah, I already have a girl I like. I'll be happy as long as things go well for my boy Yusuke.

Yusuke: Hey, thanks, man...

Naoya: Okay, ifs almost time. We need to act like we're all buddy-buddy now... One team, one dream, feel me? We'll be counting on you “Ryota”!

Tanimura: Sure. Hey, is that one of them?

Akino: Hey, guys!

Yusuke: Oh, Akino! Uh, it's been a while!

Akino: It sure has! Well, it looks like you're all here. Thanks for setting things up on the guys' side.  

Yusuke: Sure thing! Are your other friends on their way?

Akino: Hmm? Oh, Haruko and Konatsu are already waiting at the restaurant. I just took the liberty to pick you guys up!

Naoya: You're always so on top of things, Akino-chan!

Akino: Haha, you know me. Well, shall we?

[Tanimura goes to a restaurant with the guys. Sure what else can he do?]

All: Cheeeeeeers!

Akino: Okay, so let's all introduce ourselves! Who wants to go first?

Yusuke: Well, seeing as I'm the one who organized this whole thing, I might as well start things off. My name's Yusuke, and I work in sales at a printing company. Akino and I were in the same club together at college. Every now and then well get together for some drinks, and... I guess what I'm trying to say is... Uhh...

Naoya: Okay, okay—Yusuke, thank you for that lovely introduction! My turn now! I'm Naoya, and I've known Yusuke since we were little. I just can't seem to get rid of the guy! At the moment, I'm sort of what you would call “underemployed,” but don't worry! I promise I'm not some kind of freeloading slacker!

Tanimura: ……

Naoya: All right, you're up, brotha!

Tanimura: Oh, uh, right. I’m... I'm Ryota. I went to high school with these characters.

Yusuke: Yeah, what he said. We sort of bumped into each other the other day, and he told me he was single. Guess my boy's ready to hang and ready to bang—er, make a bang, that is.

Akino: Whoa, I never would've guessed you were single! Waste of hotness, if ya ask me.

Yusuke: Uh... Sure! Yeah. Totally. Guy's as hot as... a brick oven! Makes me wonder why he hasn't had a girlfriend in years! Know what I mean, Naoya?

Naoya: I do. it's 'cause he's got secrets to hide. Deep-down issues. Literal skeletons in the closet! Come on, Ryota, don't look at me like that. Relax! I'm just yankin', your chain, man! It's how close friends who dearly go way back, joke around!

Yusuke: (Keep it up, Tanimura-san! You're doing great!)

Naoya: All right, that wraps up the boys! Girls, you're up.

Yusuke: Hey, who put you in charge!?

Akino: Now now, no bickering, boys! I'll start things off. I arranged this little mixer on the girls' side, and my name is Akino! I work at a restaurant inside the Millennium Tower. Nice to meet you guys!

Tanimura: Nice to meet you, Akino.

Haruko: I'm Haruko. I usually work late nights as a nurse, so rm looking forward to having some fun today!

Naoya: Wow, a nurse! That sounds like a pretty tough job...

Akino: Your turn, Konatsu.

Konatsu: Oh, right... Uh... Okay, so... I'm Konatsu... Akino-chan invited me out tonight... Um. Glad to be here? ……

Yusuke: What do you do for work, Konatsu-chan?

Konatsu: Huh? Oh, um. I work part-time at a bookstore. Yeah...

Naoya: Oh snap, you're a part-timer!? That's pretty much what I am!

Yusuke: Yeah. a part-time worker and a full-time flake! Sorry about this guy, Konatsu-chan. He kinda... gets carried away sometimes.

Konatsu: Oh, that's... no problem...

Akino: Well, all right! Now that we got that taken care of, I'll get some food! Who's hungry!? Anything you'd recommend, Ryota-kun?

Tanimura: You know, I'm so indecisive at times like these... Yusuke, why don't you pick something for us?

Yusuke: Right... How about something filling and mouthwatering... Oh, I know! We should get some pan-fried gyoza!

{Gyoza (餃子, gyōza) are dumplings filled with ground meat and vegetables and wrapped in a thin dough.}

Akino: Ooh, great choice, Yusuke! Aside from the garlicky smell, I could eat those all day!

Yusuke: (Thanks for the assist, Tanimura-san!)

[After eating…]

Naoya: So the other day Yusuke was at work, and this girl totally asks him out!

Yusuke: Shut up, Naoya! We don't have to talk that here!

Akino: Why not? I wanna hear more!

Haruko: Yeah! You can't just end a story before it gets to the juicy stuff!

Naoya: Apparently, this girl was real old-school about it. She left a love in his desk!

Haruko: Aww, that is pretty old-fashioned! Nobody does that kind of thing anymore... except maybe Konatsu.

Konatsu: Hey, Haruko-chan!

Haruko: Come on, there's nothing wrong with that! Last time I "åecked, a girl's allowed to confess her love shyly, right? Anyway, what'd you do after you got the letter, Yusuke-kun?

Naoya: Well, here's the part where Yusuke highlights just how much of a gentleman he really is: he decided to handwrite her a letter back! And boy, did he keep messing up... He even made me go buy more paper for him! And he works at a printing company, people! There should be loads of it there!

Haruko: Amazing! So what did he write back? Let me guess... It was a rejection letter, right?

Naoya: Okay, so this is where it gets good. I thought he'd just put something simple like “Nope, not interested,” but he went and said, “I'm sorry, but I'm currently into someone else.”

Akino: Wow, he went through all that trouble.

Yusuke: Enough about this! Let's change the subject! New topic, please!

Konatsu: Um, you know...

Yusuke: Hm?

Konatsu: I think that was a wonderful thing to do, Yusuke-san, clearing things up for her like that. I'm sure she understands your feelings... You're quite sincere.

Yusuke: Oh... Thanks... I honestly didn't think much of it at the time, but I appreciate the compliment all the same. Ahahaha.

Konatsu: I meant it.

Haruko: Ooh, Konatsu! Are you into Yusuke-kun?

Konatsu: No! Well, I mean, I'm not saying I don't like him... Ugh, dammit, Haruko!

Akino: Come on, Haruko! put her on the spot like that! Go easy on the girl.

Naoya: You know what, Konatsu-chan? You're adorable. Isn't she, Ryota?

Tanimura: Yeah. A lot of girls nowadays are so masculine. Not that that's a problem, but... I dunno. Konatsu-chan just seems like the type of girl that makes me want to protect her.

Konatsu: I am? Sorry... I don't want to make you do that...

Naoya: You don't have to apologize!

Haruko: Yeah! Just say, "Thanks!" in that cute little voice of yours! Since you're so feminine and all—unlike me, apparently.

Akino: Haruko, what's that supposed to mean? Did Ryota-kun's comment rub you the wrong way?

Haruko: Heck no! I'm not that sensitive, you know!

Naoya: Haruko-chan, I actually find you quite feminine. And attractive. Thought you'd like to know.

Tanimura: Actually, Yusuke was just saying how cute Akino-san looks toda too.

Yusuke: Wait, what!?

Akino: Hah! Yeah right, Ryota-kun. I know Yusuke doesn't see me like that. Nice try, though.

Yusuke: To be honest, that's not exactly... true.

Akino: Uh…?

Yusuke: I mean, Ryota's totally right. Lately I really have noticed how pretty you are, and... yeah.

[The second course is eaten…]

Akino: What!? No way! I never would've expected to hear something like that from you, Yusuke. But thanks!

Haruko: Mm, this is delicious! Oh, by the way—I guess I should've asked this earlier, but you guys are still single, right?

Yusuke: Yeah. I only invited single guys to this get-together.

Naoya: Haha, and I bet it wasn't easy, considering most of his friends are, starting to settle down.

Yusuke: Hey, you're single too, you know!

Naoya: True enough. But there's already a girl I have my eyes on. Not that I stand a chance...

Yusuke: What?

Haruko: Oh, stop being so negative! Today is your chance to forget about all that!

Akino: That's right. And look! Our glasses are almost empty! Let's order another round!

Yusuke: Shouldn't you be taking it easy on the drinks, Akino...?

Akino: What's your problem, Yusuke? Are you trying to say I drink too much?

Yusuke: No, that's not what I meant!

Tanimura: Don't worry, Yusuke. We're all having fun here. How about you go and order some more drinks for us?

Yusuke: Oh... For sure.

Tanimura: Okay then, what'll it be? How about yuzu honey sours?

{Yuzu is a sour, tart and very fragrant citrus, slightly smaller than a billiard ball. Yuzu is a citrus that isn’t eaten straight, but is used as a souring ingredient through the use of it’s juice and zest.}

Yusuke: Oh, yeah. That sounds good. Hey, Akino, I hope you like yuzu honey sours.

Akino: That's exactly what I was thinking! How did you know? You're awesome, Yusuke.

[Outside.]

Haruko: Whew! I haven't drunk this much in forever!

Konatsu: Yeah, that was... fun.

Akino: Think I mighta... overdone it... just a bit.

Yusuke: Hey, Akino, are you all right?

Haruko: Dang, she looks pretty sloshed. What should we do?

Tanimura: Yusuke, you know where she lives, right? How about you make sure she gets home?

Yusuke: Me?

Haruko: Really? That would be super! I'll see Konatsu home. Thanks, Yusuke-kun! Well, everybody, today was fun. Thanks for coming out!

Yusuke: Come on, Akino. Let's go.

Akino: Ughhh... Hmm? Yusuke? Where we going?

Yusuke: I'm taking your drunk self home, of course.

Akino: Whaaaat! But the night’s still young! Let's go somewhere fun...

Yusuke: Uh. Well. I guess we could do that...

Naoya: You guys go. Ryota and I are gonna call it a day here.

Tanimura: Yeah, you two have fun.

Yusuke: Er, right! Thanks, guys. I owe you one. (leaves with Akino)

Naoya: Well, I'd say that went over pretty damn good!

Tanimura: That it did.

Naoya: Honestly, I didn't think it'd go this well. It was really thanks to you, Ryo— I mean, Tanimura-san.

Tanimura: I guess we'll see. This is just the beginning for those two.

Naoya: Heheh, you got that right. It's all up to our boy Yusuke now. It's not much, but this is to thank you for everything you did.

You got 50,000 yen.

Tanimura: Are you sure? I don't know if I feel right... accepting money for this.

Naoya: Ah, don't take it like that. Besides, I'll make sure I get it all back from Yusuke later. I know he appreciates your help.

Tanimura: You really got his back, don't you?

Naoya: Well, like I said, he's like a bad habit I just can't break. So what's a friend supposed do? Hahaha. Alrighty, I’m heading home.

Tanimura: Cool. Be safe out there.

Naoya: Thanks man!

[FINALLY Tanimura decides to help the poor girl and catches a cab.]

Taxi Driver: The minimum fare is 710 yen. Where would you like to go?

Tanimura: Docks. (There's no way I can avoid fighting. Should I get more prepared before I go?)

Taxi Driver: Very well, sir.

[Shibata goons already gathered a welcome parade for him…]

Tanimura: (Shit... I gotta get her back in one piece. Time to burn through these guys.)

[He defeats a hundred of Shibata's goons and finds his way to the office.]

Shibata: It seems like everything's going quite smoothly. Simply lay low for a while and wait till the storm blows over. Then things can proceed. Got that, Arai?

Arai: Understood.

Shibata: The sixth chairman will never suspect we're hiding you here. Quite the bargain for just one finger, wouldn't you say?

Arai: Heh, you mean that little charade of yours? Nice touch.

Shibata: I'll be meeting with Katsuragi tomorrow afternoon to work out the finer details of the truce.

Arai: I see... And the location?

Shibata: Kamurocho. Some place called Café Alps.

Arai: Hmm... But is Kamurocho really the right place to hold a meeting, so out in the open? Tojo Headquarters could easily discover the link between you two.

Shibata: It's fine. Katsuragi and I have a perfectly good reason for being seen together. If anything, people will just assume rm offering a further apolm Or at least I can spin it that way.

Arai: Of course.

Shibata: Hmph... But I do see why it might worry you. Especially with this woman... and the unexpected headaches she caused. (to Yasuko) You know, it's a strange feeling… Having the one responsible for all this chaos sitting right here in front of me. Why are you singling out Shibata Family men?

Yasuko: I didn't have a choice. I thought I'd never manage to get the 100 million.

Shibata: What kind of nonsense are you babbling? You know… You're a pretty little thing. Easily enough to make a man fall right into your trap.

Arai: Let's put this to rest, Patriarch Shibata. We already know she's responsible for spilling your family's blood. I say we return the favor. I'd be glad to handle it myself.

Shibata: There's no rush.

Arai: Sir?

Shibata: I'm curious. What could have prompted this woman to kill my men in cold blood? And one more thing.

[He rips her blouse.]

Shibata: She clearly has a way with her body. I'd like to get a taste for myself.

[Suddenly Arai shots him. Tanimura watches the whole thing from behind the corner.]

Arai: You've outlived your purpose.

Shibata: What are you doing!? Arai!

Arai: Don't burst a vessel over it. This was always part of the plan. Her job isn't finished yet. I, or should I say... We still need her.

Shibata: We…?

Arai: You heard right. Myself and Katsuragi-san. In addition to our... handful of collaborators.

Shibata: What? When did you flip to Katsuragi!?

Arai: You have it all wrong, Shibata-san. I've been in his camp from the very beginning.

[He shoots Shibata several times.]

Arai: I’ll tell you this in your final moments. The incident 25 years ago. You set that all up with Katsuragi-san. Correct? You agreed to help him so you could secure a better position within the Tojo Clan. But time and time again, you've used the truth as leverage to extort favors. As far as Katsuragi-san's concerned, you're nothing but dead weight. Goodbye.

Tanimura: Police! Drop your weapon!

[He points his revolver at Arai, but Arai immediately shoots. Tanimura hides around the corner. When he looks out from behind him Arai has already escaped.]

Tanimura: (to Shibata) Hey, hang in there! Are you really the one who planned the hit on Yoshiharu Ueno!? What really happened back in '85? Answer me! Hey, Shibata! I want answers!

[But… Shibata gurgles on blood and dies.]

Tanimura: Goddammit!

Chapter 2: THE PERPETRATOR
[Tanimura and Yasuko are sitting in Zhao's restaurant. Police sirens can be heard in the distance.]

Zhao: Looks like the cops are out in full force. Best stick around for the night.

Tanimura: (to Yasuko) This place is basically my hideout. The cops won't find you here. You're safe.

Yakuso: Why…? Why do all this? Why risk yourself to protect me?

[Tanimura nods to Zhao and he brings two cups.]

Tanimura: This is the restaurant's special blend. Puts the dishwater most places call tea to shame. One sip and you'll feel right at home.

Yasuko: You're with the police, aren't you? 

Tanimura: That's right. 

Yasuko: You heard what Shibata said earlier? ...About me? 

Tanimura: Yeah. I did. 

Yasuko: Then why...? 

Tanimura: Simple. I'm with the Community Safety Division, not Homicide. 

Yasuko: Even so... 

Tanimura: Even so, I couldn't prove you murdered even if I wanted to. Don't have concrete evidence. And since I lack that evidence, I'll just have to detain you here until I get what I need. Think of it like you're here for voluntary questioning. 

Yasuko: What's your angle here...? What do you really want from me? 

Tanimura: I've been looking for you for a long time. Ten years, by this point. 

[He puts his notebook before her.]

Tanimura: 25 years ago, on April 30th, 1985... You were supposed to meet with my dad. That night, they fished his body out of the Arakawa River. 

Yasuko: What!? 

Tanimura: Yasuko Saejima-san. I’m not asking this as a detective, but as a son whose father was murdered. What did my dad say to you that day? Please… I need to know.

Yasuko: You're his son... 

Tanimura: What did you and my dad talk about the day he was murdered?

Yasuko: Nothing. I waited for him, but... I never got to see him.  

Tanimura: He didn't show? 

Yasuko: No. I was supposed to meet him at a café in Kamurocho in the early afternoon. But he called me in the morning and asked me if we could reschedule for that evening.

Tanimura: Did he say why? 

Yasuko: I don't remember exactly, but he said the hit was a setup. He said, “Your brother pulled the trigger on these men, but he wasn't the real perpetrator. I'll have proof of it soon, so hang tight.”

Tanimura: You mean someone else was involved!? And he was on to their identity. 

Yasuko: Before your father hung up, he said the hit wasn't as simple as aggression between two yakuza factions... He said it was part of a much greater plot, orchestrated by a powerful force. The last thing he told me was, “Take care of yourself.”

Tanimura: ...What did he mean by “a powerful force”? 

Yasuko: I never figured that out. But when your father never showed up, I got so scared, I left Kamurocho immediately.

Tanimura: I see... Can't blame you. 

Yasuko: So your father was... You think because of his investigation of that case, somebody had... 

Tanimura: Looks like it. But what you just told me shed some new light on things. 

Yasuko: It did?

Tanimura: I always thought the person who killed my dad was either from the Tojo or the Ueno Seiwa. But something just never seemed right. 

Yasuko: How so? 

Tanimura: A cop killing normally raises a firestorm in the force. An extra-thorough investigation always follows because it's one of our own. But my fathers death was classified as accidental, even though it was clearly murder. That just doesn't happen. 

Yasuko: Do you think that “powerful force” your father mentioned... was responsible for killing him? 

Tanimura: ...It's possible. Maybe my old man came across something he wasn't meant to see. 

Yasuko: If that’s true, this whole thing's even scarier than I thought... 

Tanimura: But back to you, Yasuko-san. Why come back to Kamurocho after 25 years? And why are you bumping off Shibata Family members? 

Yasuko: ……

Tanimura: Does it have something to do with your brother? 

Yasuko: ……

Tanimura: Don't worry. Even if you tell me the truth, the police won't do a thing. None of my superiors are likely to believe a word I say, anyway. Guess that comes in handy for once. 

Yasuko: ……

Tanimura: ...Please. I need to know. 

Yasuko: ...I was contacted by a man named Katsuragi from the Ueno Seiwa Clan. He told me he'd save my brother, but on the condition that I brought him 100 million yen... or agreed to murder.

Tanimura: Katsuragi said that!? How'd he even get in touch with you? 

Yasuko: This was several months ago. I was living out in Chiba when I got a call from a man who claimed to be a detective in Tokyo. “I know someone who can save your brother. How about I introduce you to him?” He said this right out of the blue. 

Tanimura: Wait, this was someone from the police? 

Yasuko: Yes. And because it was the police, I never thought to question it. So I rushed here as fast as I could to meet this mystery person. 

Tanimura: ...Who turned out to be Katsuragi. 

Yasuko: That's right. 

Tanimura: What did he say to you? 

Yasuko: He told me he was one of the victims of the shooting 25 years ago. And if he testified that my brother wasn't the killer, the case would have to be reexamined. …Which would mean he could be released. 

Tanimura: All for the price tag of 100 million yen or murder? 

Yasuko: Yes. But 100 million is such an impossible sum of money... 

Tanimura: So you chose murder. 

Yasuko: ……

Tanimura: Why did Katsuragi send you after people connected to the Shibata Family? 

Yasuko: He didn't mention anything about them belonging to the Shibata Family. But... 

Tanimura: But? 

Yasuko: He did say eliminating certain individuals would help prove my brother's innocence. 

Tanimura: Certain individuals? 

Yasuko: Now I think he wanted to silence the people who knew the truth about what happened. 

Tanimura: I see. Now it's all starting to make sense. Katsuragi and Shibata were working together behind the scenes back then. But Shibata must've used Katsuragi's involvement to blackmail him somehow. Which is why Katsuragi sent Arai, one of his own, to kill him. 

[Zhao nods.]

Tanimura: Taiga Saejima was only the spark that lit the fire. I knew there was more to this. 

[Yasuko nods.]

Tanimura: My question is why would Arai agree to work with Katsuragi... 

Zhao: But wait! Could it be, that shooting the other day was—

Tanimura: Yeah, most likely another one of his power plays. We're talking about a criminal mastermind here. Let's get Katsuragi tmdo the talkin’.

Yasuko: How?

Tanimura: According to what Arai said, Katsuragi still needs you. And with you or bait, he'll have to come to the negotiating table. 

Zhao: Now hold on a second, Ma-chan. What happens to her when— 

Tanimura: I'm not gonna actually hand her over. He just wants to know where she is. I promise I'll keep you safe. So? Will you work with me? 

Yasuko: I can’t.

Tanimura: Why not!?

Yasuko: Because I have to save my brother! Only Katsuragi’s testimony can do that! 

Tanimura: Yasuko-san, Katsuragi forced you to murder. You're lucky you didn't get killed yourself. And he'll never tell the truth about your brother. So why do you still trust him? I'll prove your brother’s innocence. And I need to know why my dad was killed. To know that really happened in ‘85.

Yasuko: You’re selfish.

Tanimura: Huh?

Yasuko: What do you think you can actually do for me? You only care about your own issues. 

Tanimura: Yasuko-san…

Yasuko: My brother meant the world to me. I loved him so much… More than anything! Ever since my brother walked out of my life that day… This whole time, I've been alone! You're not the only one... who's lost someone precious! I hate you all... The yakuza, the police… and Katsuragi too. I don't even care who's behind all this. All I've ever wanted was to see my brother again!

Tanimura: Yasuko-san. 

Yasuko: ……

Tanimura: Please. I need your help. I swear I'll reunite you with your brother. And you won't have to kill anymore. 

Yasuko: ……

Zhao: He's not much different than you. All he wants is justice for the murder of the father he loved. Can you find it in your heart to help him?

Yasuko: Please, look at me.  

Tanimura: ……

Yasuko: All right... I'll help you. 

Tanimura: You will!? 

[She gives him a key.]

Tanimura: What's this?

Yasuko: Central Kamuro Parking Lot. It's a key to a car parked there. In the trunk of that car... you'll find 100 million yen.

Tanimura: What!?

Yasuko: I've done things for Katsuragi that I can never take back. At first I thought it would just be one, maybe two. But Katsuragi's demands wouldn't stop. Again and again, he ordered me to take innocent lives. I couldn't go on like that. I never wanted to kill. That's why I borrowed the money.

Tanimura: From who, exactly?

Yasuko: The owner of Sky Finance. A man named Akiyama-san.

Tanimura: Sky Finance...

Yasuko: I'm entrusting that 100 million to you. If Katsuragi needs some convincing to testify on my brother's behalf… You know what needs to be done.

Tanimura: I understand, but… Why not keep it with you?

Yasuko: I'm leaving for Okinawa.

Tanimura: Right now? Why?

Yasuko: My brother's execution is in two days. A guard at Tokyo Penitentiary told me. That's where he was being held before his transfer.

Tanimura: And now your brother's down in Okinawa?

Yasuko: Yes. Apparently they transferred him there only a few days ago. That guard was nice enough to at least share that with me. I suppose he felt sorry for me. I tried to visit my brother every day… But never once did I get to see him.

Tanimura: Every day, for 25 years?

Yasuko: I don't have much time left. So... if we can't get that stay of execution… at least want to be near him. You're the only one I can trust, Tanimura-san. Please, do what you can for my brother. (bows and leaves)

====Retrieve the 100 Million====
Tanimura: Yasuko-san said this key was for a car she left in the Central Parking Lot. 

Zhao: Hope nobody broke into the trunk. 

Tanimura: Seriously. Guess there's only one way to find out. 

[He leaves the restaurant.]

Tanimura: (I wonder what the fastest way into Kamurocho Central Parking is...)

Woman: *speaking Tagalog* 

{Tagalog is an Austronesian language spoken as a first language by the ethnic Tagalog people, who make up a quarter of the population of the Philippines, and as a second language by the majority. Its standardized form, officially named Filipino, is the national language of the Philippines, and is one of two official languages, alongside English.}

Officer: You wouldn't happen to speak English as well, would you? 

Woman: *speaking Tagalog* 

Officer: It’s no use. She doesn't understand a word I say. 

Tanimura: Hey there, officer. 

Officer: Oh, Tanimura-san! You couldn't have come at a better time! 

Tanimura: Is something wrong? 

Officer: No, but it sounds like this woman is looking for someone. But she can't speak Japanese, so I'm not really sure what to do. I was trying to get her to follow me back to the station so we could have an interpreter help us, but she doesn't seem keen on leaving this spot. 

Tanimura: I see. I'll take things from here. 

Officer: Thanks and sorry about this. Can I leave her to you then? 

Tanimura: No worries. If you had taken her to the station I would have been the interpreter anyways. So it saves time if I just do it here instead. 

Officer: Heheh. You got a point there. Thanks again. 

[The officer leaves.]

Tanimura: Well then. (I’m a police officer. You can talk to me about whatever it is you're having trouble with.)

Woman: (Great! I finally found someone I can actually converse with!) 

Tanimura: (My name is Tanimura. I’m with the Tokyo Metro Police Department. Who are you?)

Woman: (I'm Nair. This is my first trip to Japan, and I still haven't got my bearings quite yet.) 

Tanimura: (Nair... Nice to meet you. I'm guessing you're from Southeast Asia? Anyways, you're looking for someone right?) 

Nair: (That's right. Well, actually I’m a detective too.) 

Tanimura: (You? A detective?) 

Nair: (That's right. I've followed a criminal to Japan to bring him to justice.)

Tanimura: (Can you just do that? Do the Japanese police know what you're up to here?) 

Nair: (I contacted the Japanese police before I left. They're supposed to be helping… But once I got here everyone seemed so busy. No one would help me with my investigation.)

Tanimura: (Oh, I see. Everything's a bit of a mess right now, so I bet not everyone knows you're even here.) 

Nair: (I was also told I would be given an interpreter.) 

Tanimura: (And I'm guessing you didn't get that either? I apologize for the inconvenience.) 

Nair: (It’s not your fault. I’m just happy to finally talk to someone I can understand.)

Tanimura: (Glad to be of assistance.) 

Nair: (But I have a little dilemma. We have permission to investigate, but we don't have the authority to make arrests. In Japan, only the Japanese police are allowed to make arrests.) 

Tanimura: (You've got a point there, but it's not our investigation. We can't make an arrest without sufficient evidence.)

Nair: (There is evidence. That's why my colleagues and I came to Japan hoping for some help from you guys.)

Tanimura: (Colleagues?)

Nair: (They're out at the embassy now. Tanimura-san, would you come with me for a bit?)

[They move someplace else.]

Tanimura: (What is this place?)

Nair: (We don't have cell phones that work in Japan right now, so this is our rendezvous point.) 

Tanimura: (I see now. That's why you couldn't follow that officer to the police station.) 

Nair: (The criminal we're seeking won't be in Japan for long. So we have to investigate quickly, along with the embassy and Japanese police. Tanimura-san, would you please help us? We have to catch our criminal!)

Tanimura: (Me?)

Nair: (Yes, I beg of you! We'll take care of the investigation, but we need you to come along to make the arrest.) 

Tanimura: (I’m not sure… This sounds like more trouble than it's worth, but I guess the station will make me do it later, even if I refuse right now. (If that's the case, then it'd be easier for me if I did this my way. All right. I'll help.) 

Nair: (Really!? Thank you! Thank you, Tanimura-san!)

Tanimura: (By the way, I have no problem arresting the criminal, but you guys don't have guns, right? Isn't that dangerous?)

Nair: (I don't usually carry a gun. A police officer's job is to capture criminals, not kill them.)

Tanimura: (If that's true, you've done a good job at staying alive. Don’t you have dangerous cases?) 

Nair: (I may not look it, but I pack a pretty strong punch. Stronger than any of the gangs here.) 

Tanimura: (Really? I wouldn't have guessed.) 

Nair: (I can't win a head-on slugfest with men though. I use their own. strength against them.)

Tanimura: (So you're good at parrying, I guess? I prefer countering to simple brawls too, so I can understand your logic.)

Nair: (Oh yeah? We should try sparring together then!)  

Tanimura: (Sparring?)

Nair: (Yeah. That way we can share techniques and help each other get better. Sparring is important, no matter what martial art you practice.)

Tanimura: (I dunno if my style could be called a martial art… But all right. While we spar you can update me on the progress of the investigation.)  

Nair: (Sounds great. You can come here anytime and I'll fill you in.) 

Tanimura: (Okay. When I have time then.) 

Nair: (Oh yeah. I was meaning to ask you something else. Have you heard of Revelations?) 

Tanimura: (Revelations?) 

Nair: (Yeah, I heard there are times you can have epic Revelations, just by witnessing certain special events throughout the city. People like us that train regularly can use that inspiration to discover new techniques.)

Tanimura: (Revelations, huh. I think I understand. but I’m not sure I know how it works.)  

Nair: (When you witness the perfect shot, make sure to record it somehow! At least that's what someone told me. I've been keeping memos of the various new things I've seen since coming to Japan, and I already have some technique-wor material.) 

Tanimura: (That's interesting. I'll try using the notepad I always carry the next time I see something.) 

Nair: (Worth a try. I'll keep an eye out for things going on around town too. Anyways, sorry to ask so much of you. I may not be here for long, but I appreciate your help.) 

[Tanimura leaves. Suddenly Mei Hua approaches him.]

Mei Hua: Ma-chan! Help! It’s Dad... You gotta help my dad! 

Tanimura: What's wrong? 

Mei Hua: (wiping tears) They... took him away! 

Tanimura: Who did!? What happened? 

Mei Hua: These scary guys burst into Homeland and harassed us about a woman named Nadine... 

Tanimura: Do you know who they were? 

Mei Hua: No... But I think I know where they headed: somewhere off of Senryo Avenue. Please, Ma-chan, you gotta save my dad! 

Tanimura: Don't worry, I'll get him back in one piece. You just head back to the restaurant where it's safe, okay? 

Mei Hua: No! rm going, too! 

Tanimura: I had a feeling you'd say that... Fine. But we've gotta hurry. Think you can keep up? 

Mei Hua: Of course I can! By the way, Ma-chan. I brought these for you in case you were tired. Hope you like them! 

You got a Staminan X. 

You got a Toughness Z. 

Tanimura: You're the best. Now let's get going! 

Mei Hua: I’m right behind you! 

[Tanimura quickly finds Zhao. He is pinned against a wall by a group of thugs.]

Zhao: How many times do I have to tell you? I don't know any Nadine! 

Yakuza: We're in no hurry, old man. How about we take a trip to our office and jog your memory there? 

Zhao: I have nothing to say to you! Now keep your filthy hands away from me! 

Tanimura: Come on, guys. Do I really need to remind you of the legal ramifications for abduction? Or are you actually that dumb? 

Yakuza: Who the hell are you? 

Tanimura: Does it matter? All you need to know is I'm taking Zhao-san back. This might get dangerous, Mei Hua. Hang tight for a minute. 

[She runs away to the side.]

Tanimura: All right, assholes—let's see what you got! 

[He kicks their asses and the yakuza rubs away.]

Tanimura: Hey. They hurt you any? 

Zhao: No... I’m fine. Didn't mean to get you involved. 

Tanimura: They were looking for a woman named Nadine, right? She your buddy or something? 

Zhao: Nadine... came here from the Philippines to seek better financial opportunities. But the authorities found out she was working illegally and now they're trying to chase her down. 

Tanimura: Then she sought help from the Asian Gateway, I'm assuming?

Zhao: Correct. She was actually at the restaurant at the time those thugs showed up. Luckily, she was in the back room and got the hell out of there as soon as she heard the commotion. 

Tanimura: All right, then who were those people just now? Not the authorities, that's for sure. 

Zhao: My guess is they're responsible for bringing illegal immigrants into the country—in other words, human traffickers. They must be afraid that if Nadine gets arrested, she'll lead the lice right back to them. 

Tanimura: Makes sense. But I doubt she'll be coming this way anymore... Gonna be a real pain in the ass to find her.

Zhao: ...There is one method you can try.  

Tanimura: Yeah? I'm all ears. 

Zhao: So... There's this fortune teller over on Tenkaichi Street. Maybe she could help you track Nadine down. 

Tanimura: A fortune teller. Is that seriously the best you can come up with? Or were you just kidding? 

Zhao: Oh, it's no joke. In fact, this lady is known for being freakishly accurate with her predictions. Kind of spooky, if you ask me. 

Tanimura: It sure sounds spooky... but whatever. If you're the one who's recommending it, then I guess I have nothing to lose. Where's this place, exactly? 

Zhao: Middle of Tenkaichi Street, right next to a host club called Stardust. 

Tanimura: Mmkay. Here's hoping fortune's on our side, huh? 

[He decides to find this fortune teller and look for the car at the same time. As it turns out the car is not easy to find.]

Fortune-curious Woman: Ah... The admirable Naomi-san... Maybe I'll have my fortune told... But she's always got this weird green afro guy at her side, and there's rumors that she doesn't really tell your fortune, and her prices are super high... ...Can I really get my fortune read here? Maybe I'll stop by the next time I'm worried about my future... 

[Tanimura enters the fortune teller shop.]

Naomi: Welcome, welcome. What can Naomi's amazing psychic powers do for you today? 

Tanimura: I'm looking for a Filipina woman who's gone missing. Her name's Nadine. 

Naomi: Nadine, you say? Was she your sweetheart? You must let go of what is gone. Accepting the inevitable is simply a part of life, young man.

Tanimura: Are you going to help me or not? My friend Zhao-san over in Little Asia said you have the power to see the unseen. 

Naomi: Heh, yes, but my services do not come cheap, Detective Tanimura.

Tanimura: You know who I am?

{He patrols this area and extorts money on top of it so of course everyone knows him.Magic.gif}

Naomi: What sort of psychic would I be if I didn't at least know that? Naomi sees all, knows all.

Tanimura: Right... Okay, then, do you know where Nadine is? 

Naomi: …… (looking into her crystal ball)

Tanimura: What're you doing? 

Naomi: Silence. The Great and Powerful Naomi must concentrate. Yes, yes... I see a name... Saki-than... You should go ask Saki-chan.

Tanimura: Saki-chan? 

Naomi: She will give you the information you seek. 

Tanimura: You're not giving me the runaround, are you? 

Naomi: Hmph, if you do not trust my powers, you can take your business elsewhere. 

Tanimura: Fine. Then just tell me where I can find this Saki-chan. 

Naomi: Near Pink Street. She'll be wearing a purple scarf. 

Tanimura: Thanks. If this goes well, you'll have yourself a new customer. 

Naomi: Hmph. Come again. 

[Tanimura finds Saki-chan outside a certain place with a large sign. The sign reads something like the following.]

倩報館 (Information Center)
割引情報もりだくさん★夜遊び情報満載★ (Lots of discount offers★Lots of nightlife deals★)

[Saki herself turns out to be an old transvestite.]

Tanimura: (So that's Saki-chan, huh... Well, I guess no one explicitly said what kind of woman she'd be… And a purple scarf? Couldn't I have gotten some other clue? An accessory that anyone could wear isn't exactly a distinguishing feature...) Hey there. Would you happen to be Saki-сhan? 

Saki-chan: Ooh, hey there yourself. ♪ Don't tell me—you were about to use a pickup line, weren't you? Isn't he adorable, folks!? 

Tanimura: (shows his badge) Actually... I'm looking for somebody. A woman named Nadine. 

Saki-chan: ...Oh shit! (runs away)

Tanimura: Hey! Get back here! 

[He chases Saki-chan down.]

Tanimura: *pant* Look... *pant* I think you have the wrong idea. I'm not after Nadine—in fact, I'm trying to help her. 

Saki-chan: ...Are you really? 

Tanimura: Cross my heart. So what's up with the whole chase sequence as soon as you saw my badge? Are you hiding something? 

Saki-chan: Well, the thing is... I help people. 

Tanimura: Help them how? 

Saki-chan: I use my connections to help foreign women when the cops or criminals come for them. 

Tanimura: So I take it you know Nadine, then. 

Saki-chan: What would you do if you found her? 

Tanimura: Let me put it this way: she'll be dead if I don't find her first. And I'd like to get her home safe before that happens. 

Saki-chan: ……All right. I know where she is... I'm actually the one looking after her. 

Tanimura: Great! Can you take me to see her, then? 

Saki-chan: Well, you do seem like a decent guy... Alrighty-poo. ♪ You just follow me. 

[They go to some office.]

Tanimura: So, you're Nadine?

Nadine: Yes…

Saki-chan: He says he's here to help you, dear. 

Nadine: Really? 

Tanimura: Yep. Had a heck of a time trying to find you, too. Nice work. 

Saki-chan: She's not out of trouble just yet. Those creeps have her passport, and she can't get home without it. 

Tanimura: You mean... the human traffickers? 

Saki-chan: I take it you've run into them already. Well, it’s not only afficking they do. They're in charge of managing the women they bring in, too.

Tanimura: Managing? In what sense? 

Saki-chan: They take the women's passports so they can't escape, and then give them just enough money to eke out a meager living. They're essentially modern-day slave drivers. 

Tanimura: Ugh... That’s terrible. I hate bastards like that the most. You have any idea where they are? 

Saki-chan: In a dilapidated food warehouse on the docks. 

Nadine: I want go home to the Philippines... 

Tanimura: Don't worry. I'll get your passport back. 

Nadine: You will!? 

Tanimura: Yup. Just leave it to me. 

[Tanimura leaves the office.]

Taxi Driver: The minimum fare is 710 yen. Where would you like to go? 

Tanimura: Docks.

Taxi Driver: Very well. sir. 

[He finds a group of yakuza.]

Tanimura: (A food warehouse on the docks, huh? Then those must be the guys who took Nadine's passport...) 'Scuse me. I'm here for the passports you've been stealing foreign women. 

Yakuza: Wait a minute. Aren't you...? 

Tanimura: Yeah, you bet I am. If you don't want to get hurt again, hand over the passports. And make it quick. 

Yakuza: You're one cocky son of a bitch, you know that? All right, you're up! Come on out! 

Tanimura: Oh, what... What the hell do you feed this guy? Milk? Beef? Growth hormones? 

Yakuza: Now, pulverize this punk! 

[Tanimura introduces them to the asphalt.]

Tanimura: How many times must I say it? Give me the passports. 

Yakuza: Fine... Just take the damn things! 

[After that he meets with Saki-chan in some bar.]

Saki-chan: Just to let you know, I got a call from Nadine this morning. She got home safe and sound. 

Tanimura: Good to hear. I hope this means fewer migrant workers like her will suffer through the same shitty experience. 

Saki-chan: I don't mean to be a sourpuss, but even though you busted up those jerks at the warehouse, this kind of thing will still go on. 

Tanimura: Why do you say that? 

Saki-chan: Because men like that are everywhere. They're only after one thing: the almighty yen, and they'll stop at nothing to get it. Even if it means ruining countless lives. 

Tanimura: But there has to be someone at the top pulling the strings. 

Saki-chan: You're saying there's a mastermind of the sex industry... A ringleader making millions off the lives of female migrant workers? ful as it is, that doesn't sound too far-fetched. 

Tanimura: Right. Every power structure has its person in charge. You have any leads on where this ringleader might be? 

Saki-chan: Not really. But I have heard those traffickers drop the name “Bridge” before. That could be a clue. 

Tanimura: Wait, did you just say “Bridge”? 

Saki-chan: Oh, you know him? 

Tanimura: My dad left notes about someone named Bridge all throughout his notebook. Oh, sorry. I should probably clarify what I mean by that. 

Saki-chan: No need. I know all about you... Detective Tanimura of the KPD. 

Tanimura: How did you...?

Saki-chan: I heard about you from Naomi-san, the fortune teller. Tell me, what specifically did your father's notebook say about Bridge?

Tanimura: Apparently, K and my dad were investigating him.  

Saki-chan: And who is “K”?

Tanimura: Another detective who worked with my dad. But damn... I never would've guessed that Bridge was some sort of sex trafficking kingpin... This could get ugly. 

Saki-chan: Do you intend to find this Bridge and expose him?

Tanimura: Oh yeah. Especially if this is the same guy my dad was after. Still don't have any idea who K is, though. 

Saki-chan: Have you done your research?

Tanimura: I looked up all the detectives who ever worked a case with my dad, but none of their names started with "K." And there's no file on Bridge, either. I think K and my dad were investigating Bridge off the record. 

{Japanese surnames are usually composed of two characters. Each character can have several readings. Tanimura had only the first character. In my opinion, it's much more interesting to have half a surname and have no idea who it belongs to...}

Saki-chan: You know... The more you look into this, the more you're going to uncover about your past. 

Tanimura: ...What are you trying to say? 

Saki-chan: Taigi Tanimura was my senior detective. 

Tanimura: You were... a detective? Judging from what you just said, I'm sure you know Taigi wasn't my actual dad, right? 

Saki-chan: ...Mhm. 

Tanimura: Then you know who my real dad is? 

Saki-chan: I can't comment on that. All I can say is, if you don't want to get hurt by what you find, I suggest you leave this case alone.

Tanimura: Hmph. I won't get hurt. That's impossible.  

Saki-chan: Oh?

Tanimura: See, no matter who my real dad is, I'm still gonna be the same guy. Let the past be the past, y'know? 

Saki-chan: ……

Tanimura: By the way, why do they call this guy “Bridge”?

Saki-chan: Couldn't tell ya, hon. 

Tanimura: I see. Well, I guess this is just one more case my dad left me to solve. No matter what, I'm gonna find this Bridge... and bring his ass to justice. 

[Tanimura goes to the Parking Lot and tries to find the car again.]

Tanimura: (Does the key fit?) 

Thug: Hey! What're you doing to my ride!? 

Tanimura: Oh, no, nothing. 

Thug: Strange... There's been a string of break-ins around here these past few days... I bet it was you! 

Tanimura: Trust me, it’s not. Besides, do I look desperate enough to break into a bucket like that? 

Thug: Hey, this ain't no bucket! It's vintage, dammit! It has its own sort of charm— You know what, forget it! You just earned yourself an ass-kicking! 

[Tanimura kicks their asses…]

Thug: Shit…

Tanimura: Also, I'm with Tokyo PD. Probably should've mentioned that sooner. 

Thug: What the hell!? You mean I just picked a fight with a cop!? 

Tanimura: Yep. But it was partly my fault, too. Don't worry, I won't tell if you won't.

Yakuza: Hey, asshole. Get the hell away from my car. 

Tanimura: Oh, sorry. I thought this was my friend’s. 

Yakuza: Bullshit! This thing's a custom job. There's only one like it in the goddamn world, let alone in Kamurocho! You think you can steal it right in front of me!? 

Tanimura: Hold on, man. Just listen to me for a second! There's a perfectly good explanation for— 

Yakuza: I’ll teach you not to mess with another man's wheels, you filthy carjacking scum! 

[Tanimura smashes yakuza’s head with his foot.]

Yakuza: Damn... 

Tanimura: See what happens when you don't listen? All I'm doing is looking for a friend's car. 

Yakuza: ...Really? 

Tanimura: Yeah, but you had to go and jump to conclusions. Do I really look like I'm about to go steal a car? 

Yakuza: ...I guess not. Sorry about that. 

Tanimura: As long you get it, we're cool. 

Thug: Phew, that's a relief... Well, see you around. Er... Hopefully not soon.

[Tanimura tries another trunk…]

Tanimura: (Does the key fit?)

[Tanimura tries one more car…]

Tanimura: (Does the key fit? Nope. Let's try another one. ) 

[Half an hour later…]

Tanimura: (Does the key fit? It opened! And there's that briefcase, just like Yasuko-san said.)

You got the briefcase. 

Tanimura: (Okay, so I've got a briefcase loaded to the brim with yen. 100 million yen, in fact. This is good. All that's left is figuring out how to get in touch with Katsuragi...) 

====Get In Touch With Katsuragi====
Tanimura: (Now what's the easiest way for a Community Safety officer to reach a powerful member of the yakuza? ...Never thought I'd ask myself that.) 

[He leaves the Parking Lot and gets a call.]

Tanimura: Hello? 

Anonymous Caller: Tanimura-san, right? 

Tanimura: Yeah, that's me. And you are? 

Anonymous Caller: Heh, that's not important. Let's just cut to the chase. You want info on Katsuragi, don't you? 

Tanimura: How did you...? 

Anonymous Caller: It’s my job to know that sort of thing. As such, it works only to my benefit to funnel information to you. 

Tanimura: That’s... fine, but why should I believe some random caller who could be a total scammer for all I know? 

Anonymous Caller: Good point. Except... You don't have anywhere else to turn right now, do you?

Tanimura: ...Not really.  

Anonymous Caller: That's what I thought. Now do you want that information or not? Of course, you could always hang up and be on your way. 

Tanimura: No, let's hear what you have to say. 

Anonymous Caller: Smart man. Only thing is, nothing in life is free.

Tanimura: What, you're giving me a quote already?  

Anonymous Caller: Everything has its price, officer. But I'm not interested in your money. I just want to see how good of a detective you are. You'll be receiving a message from me shortly. Open it up, read it, and follow the instructions. Very self-explanatory. Well, best of luck. 

Tanimura: Hey, we're not done yet! 

Anonymous Caller: *beep*

[Tanimura receives an email…]

No Subject
(Private)
An informant awaits you where this sight can be seen. Get over there on the double.

[There’s a photo in the email. It’s on one of the rooftops. Tanimura tries to find the place and succeeds. He finds a homeless there.]

Homeless Man: Are you Tanimura-san? 

Tanimura: That I am. You the one who called me? 

Homeless Man: I don't know anything about a call... My boss just told me to come here and give this to you. Here, take it.

[He hands Tanimura a bouquet.] 

Tanimura: What’s this for? 

Homeless Man: Heheh... I dunno, maybe you got a secret admirer? Either way, it's yours now. (leaves)

Tanimura: (A bouquet of flowers? I don't get it. Wait, there's a note inside. It says… “Well done, gumshoe. You take after your papa more than I expected. I suppose I should uphold my end of the bargain. You’ll be getting a call from Katsuragi soon. What you do next is up to you. Just see that you don't waste this chance.”)

[After Tanimura reads the note he gots a call.]

Katsuragi: Tanimura-san, one of Kamurocho's finest. To what do I owe the honor?

Tanimura: I have a deal for you. 

Katsuragi: Do you now... 

Tanimura: Yeah. I've got Yasuko Saejima in my custody. 

Katsuragi: ……

Tanimura: I haven't called it in yet, either. Making me the only one who knows her whereabouts.

Katsuragi: I see.  

Tanimura: I know some interesting things about you. For instance, how you ordered Yasuko to murder Shibata Family men. Classy way to cover up a mass shooting, I know.

Katsuragi: ……

Tanimura: And if I'm not mistaken, you still need Yasuko around. Don't you? 

Katsuragi: What is it you want in return? 

Tanimura: I want the truth about the Ueno Seiwa hit. Specifically, Taigi Tanimura, the lead detective on the case. Why did he have to die?

Katsuragi: Could it be... I'm speaking to his son right now? 

Tanimura: Look, if you give me the information I want, Yasuko's all yours. So what'll it be? I imagine it's tough keeping a secret for 25 years. 

Katsuragi: Fine, under one condition. 

Tanimura: Name it. 

Katsuragi: Unfortunately for you, I'm not the kind of man who goes sharing his heart with a stranger. And there's no way I can confirm you have Yasuko in custody over the phone. So I would need solid proof you're connected to her. 

Tanimura: All right. How about I bring the 100 million? Would that convince you?

Katsuragi: Beg your pardon? 

Tanimura: The money you told Yasuko-san to give you. I have it all with me right now. 

Katsuragi: ……

Tanimura: She managed to come up with it herself. It's yours if you make good on the deal. You can even have someone confirm it's all there. How's that sound? 

Katsuragi: Hmm... I doubt a street cop like you could get that kind of money to run a sting. All right then. Pick a date. 

Tanimura: How about tomorrow? 

Katsuragi: Not a problem. The place? 

Tanimura: Kamurocho. 5:00 PM in front of the Millennium Tower. 

Katsuragi: Heheh. I see you thought this through. No danger of being attacked in public, at a place and time with high foot traffic. 

Tanimura: …….

Katsuragi: Very well. 5:00 PM in front of the Millennium Tower it is. One of my men will confirm that 100 million. You mentioned that won't be a problem? 

Tanimura: Not at all. 

Katsuragi: Tomorrow, then. 

Tanimura: (I’m meeting Katsuragi tomorrow at 5:00 PM. I think I'll go rest at Homeland till then.) 

[He returns to Homeland.]

Zhao: Ah, Ma-chan. How'd it go? You find the briefcase? 

Tanimura: Yeah, took me long enough. Sure wish I'd thought to ask Yasuko-san what her car looked like before she left. Anyway, I got a call from Katsuragi not long after that. We set up a meeting tomorrow. 

Zhao: Really, you did!? Wow, that's quite the breakthrough! I'm sure he's up to something, though. You'd better be prepared!  

Tanimura: I will be. In the meantime, you mind holding on to this briefcase for me? 

[He hides the briefcase.]

Zhao: Ma-chan, you ready to go meet with Katsuragi tomorrow? You can rest here until then. 

Tanimura: (Hmm... ) Sounds like a good idea. Thanks. 

Zhao: Sure. You take it easy now. 

March 9th
The next day…

Tanimura: Well, Zhao-san, I'm off. 

Zhao: All right. Stay on your toes, Ma-chan. 

Tanimura: Will do. 

[He goes to the Millennium Tower with his eyes peeled. Someone approaches him from behind…]

???: Did I keep you waiting?

Tanimura: You're… Katsuragi.

Katsuragi: I am.

Tanimura: How long have you been here? 

Katsuragi: Heh, since long before you arrived. 

Tanimura: ……

Katsuragi: I'd wager you saw me in the crowd, but didn't recognize me. That tells me you don't have much of a file on me. A relief, really. 

Tanimura: ……

Katsuragi: Now, what will it be? Shall we proceed with the deal? 

Tanimura: No, let's walk and talk. 

Katsuragi: Here?

Tanimura: Around. Maybe it'll help jog your memory, Anow? I'm sure you have so much to tell. 

Katsuragi: ...You really have thought this through. A moving target is a lot harder to hit. 

Tanimura: Not to mention I thought you'd appreciate a nice, long stroll through Tojo Clan turf. 

Katsuragi: How thoughtful of you. Then lead the way, Tanimura-san. All right, let's get down to business. Tanimura-san. You said you wanted to know the truth about what happened to your father.

Tanimura: Yeah… About how he was murdered. It had something to do with the attempt on Yoshiharu Ueno's life 25 years ago, right?

Katsuragi: I'm not one to beat around the bush, so I'll just say it. You're mistaken. 

Tanimura: Oh really? Heh, maybe you didn't know, but I was there when Arai killed Shibata. My dad risked his life to find out that connection on his own. And that's what got him killed. Isn't it? 

Katsuragi: There is some truth to that, Tanimura-san… Namely, that your father did his homework on Shibata and I regarding the past incident. In fact, the two of us authored that script. So I knew the exact time and place Taiga Saejima would fulfill his duty.

Tanimura: Hold up. You're telling me you planned on being a victim… of a shooting you set up? How did you think you'd survive? 

Katsuragi: (smirks) Didn't I just tell you? I knew every last detail of how Saejima would attack in advance. 

Tanimura: You wore body armor?

Katsuragi: Something like that. Let's just say I was thorough with my preparations. That's all. 

Tanimura: So, you conspired with Shibata to eliminate your family's officers and make it look like a Tojo hit. And you did this knowing you could end up dead? 

Katsuragi: At the time, I was only 22. Shibata himself was 30. Both of us understood that rising up the ranks at out, decisive action had to be taken. 

Tanimura: You did become a lieutenant in the Ueno Seiwa. And Shibata rose to the top of the Tojo. I'd say your plan was a success. 

Katsuragi: That would be an accurate conclusion.

Tanimura: You seem rather nonchalant about all this.

Katsuragi: Well, it has been 25 years. I could give you a play-by-play down to the minute and the police still couldn't touch me.

Tanimura: True, the statute of limitations would apply… As long as you kept your hands clean. That's why you used Yasuko-san to eliminate Shibata's men, and Arai to wipe out their boss. Sound about right?

Katsuragi: Yes, I suppose it does.

Tanimura: Though I doubt you'd admit your involvement in court... Fine, let's get back on track. Why did my father have to die 25 years ago? I want a real answer.

Katsuragi: Your father, the Tanimura-san of my generation, had discovered Shibata and I were behind the hit.  But he stumbled onto something even bigger during his investigation. 

Tanimura: And what exactly was that? 

Katsuragi: Corruption. Digging in deeper led him to uncover corruption within the upper echelons of the police force. 

Tanimura: Corruption... in the force? 

Katsuragi: You may not know this, but the police staged a cover-up of the hit. They concealed the real killer and Taiga Saejima took the fall.

Tanimura: What do you mean by “real” killer? 

Katsuragi: Just what I said. Saejima popped our boys with bullets, but someone else finished the job. 

Tanimura: Yasuko-san did mention another perpetrator... So you weren't lying. 

Katsuragi: Your old man figured it out pretty quick. What he didn't bargain for was an institution that would purposely bury his work... ...Let alone bury him along with it. 

Tanimura: (assertively) Who was it, then!? Who murdered my dad!? And who finished the hit!?

Katsuragi: Heh… 

[He lights a cigarette.]

Katsuragi: Can't remember the last time I was outside this time of day.

Tanimura: (assertively) Answer me, Katsuragi!

Katsuragi: First, your end of the bargain. You know where Yasuko Saejima-san is. And you're going to tell me. What are you doing?

Tanimura: This 100 mil is all yours. In return, I want you to forget about Yasuko-san. She already left for Okinawa. To see Taiga Saejima.

[Katsuragi starts laughing softly.]

Tanimura: What's so funny? She's through working for you!

Katsuragi: (throws the cigarette) I'm afraid it's all too late. Too late for Yasuko Saejima. And too late for you.

[In the conversation, Tanimura did not notice that there’s no one on the Theater Square.]

Tanimura: What the hell? What's going on?

[Dozens of yakuza appear behind his back.]

Katsuragi: Yasuko Saejima-san will just have to wait. The problem in front of me takes priority.

Tanimura: Katsuragi! You double-crossing…

Katsuragi: Let me tell you this in your final moments. The one who killed those eighteen men, all the way back in 1985… Well…

[He gets closer to Taminura.]

Katsuragi: It was me.

Tanimura: What!?

[Katsuragi walks away.]

Tanimura: Katsuragi! We're not done here! 

[The yakuza grabs him.]

Katsuragi: Oh, yes. You know that restaurant you love so much? Homeland, was it? I've arranged for its owner to be “taken care of.”

Tanimura: What!?

Katsuragi: Better hurry before time runs out. Or that Chinese gentleman… And his cute little daughter will be gone forever.

Tanimura: You son of a..!

Katsuragi: My condolences.

Tanimura: Wait! Are you the one who murdered my father!? I want answers, Katsuragi!

Katsuragi: Hmm. Haven't the slightest idea.

[He walks away, and a police car bursts into the yakuza crowd with sirens blaring. Sugiuchi gets out of it.]

Sugiuchi: Break it up, slimeballs!

Tanimura: Sugiuchi-san.

Sugiuchi: Get the hell out of here! Or are you just gonna let that asshole off your friends?

Tanimura: Right!

Sugiuchi: (to yakuzas) We've got cells with all your names on 'em down at Homicide. You're under arrest!

Tanimura: (I need to get to Homeland before those thugs do!) 

[He bursts through the yakuza using the steel briefcase with 100 million as a weapon. One of them even steals the briefcase but Tanimura chases him down.]

Ueno Seiwa Clan Member: Ngh... Argh... 

Tanimura: Sorry, but you'll have to try harder than that. 

Ueno Seiwa Clan Member: Too many... goddamn... tackles... Think I busted a rib! 

[Tanimura is surrounded again.]

Ueno Seiwa Clan Member: Heheh... Going somewhere? 

Tanimura: You people really don't give up, do you? Fine... If it's a fight you want, you got it! 

[He wins the fight.]

Tanimura: (This is taking way too long. I need to get there, now!)

[He runs through the rooftops to the restaurant…]

Tanimura: (This is bad. This place is crawling with Katsuragi's goons. ) 

Ueno Seiwa Clan Member: There he is! 

Tanimura: (Agh, I don't have time for this! Better make a run for it!)

[He runs away! Meanwhile a couple of Ueno Seiwa thugs picking on a girl guarding the entrance to the narrow alleys.] 

Ueno Seiwa Clan Member: This it? Talk about hard to find. Now scram. Wouldn't want ya getting hurt, now would we? 

Tanimura: Hold it right there!  

Ueno Seiwa Clan Member: Well, well... Kudos on making it this far. 

Tanimura: (Take this to Homeland for me.)

Girl: (Okay!)

[The girl runs away with the briefcase.]

Tanimura: I know you're after me, so leave these people out of it! 

Ueno Seiwa Clan Member: We're actually more interested in that restaurant and the money than you, but if you want us to walk over your corpse to get 'em, hey, that's your call. 

[Tanimura smashes their heads with a road sign and goes to Homeland.]

Zhao: Ma-chan! What happened!? 

Tanimura: You're all right! Man, I'm so happy, I could hug you... Maybe after I catch my breath. 

Mei Hua: Are you... okay, Ma-chan?

Tanimura: Yeah... I'll be good in a minute. 

Mei Hua: Oh, by the way. There's someone here to see you. 

Tanimura: Huh? 

Chief Hisai: Tanimura-kun! Thank goodness you're safe! 

Tanimura: Chief...?

Chapter 3: DOOR TO THE TRUTH
Zhao: What!? You mean someone else killed those 18 men?

Tanimura: Right. The Ueno Seiwa officers were taken out by one of their own: Katsuragi. 

Zhao: Then Yasuko Saejima's brother is innocent? 

Tanimura: Well, he did carry out the attack, so he's far from innocent. But there's a big difference in sentencing for murder and attempted murder. 

Zhao: Hrm... 

Chief Hisai: Was this Katsuragi also responsible for killing your father? 

Tanimura: I couldn't get an answer out of him. 

Chief Hisai: I see... Either way, Tanimura-kun, that stunt you pulled had me worried half to death! I got a call from Sugiuchi-kun in Homicide telling me you were trying to contact the Ueno Seiwa. So I took it upon myself to search for you before you wound up in danger... Which ended up happening anyway! 

Tanimura: Ahh, so that's why you're here. 

Chief Hisai: Tanimura-kun. You must have some inclination as to how dangerous the Ueno Seiwa Clan is right now. Are you even aware — of the gravity of this situation? 

Tanimura: Eh, more or less. 

Chief Hisai: *sigh*

Zhao: Well, at least this Katsuragi seems to know something about your father's killer. Sounds like progress to me. 

Tanimura: Yeah, I guess that's one way to look at it... 

Zhao: Then why the long face? You finally have a promising lead. 

Tanimura: Something that Katsuragi said has been bugging me. 

Zhao: And what was that? 

Tanimura: The police covered up the truth about the massacre in 1985. They knew the real killer was Katsuragi, but they pinned it all on Saejima. 

Zhao: Huh? 

Chief Hisai: What!? 

Tanimura: None of this rings a bell, Chief? 

Chief Hisai: No. I'm not in Homicide, and back then I was as low on the totem pole as it gets. 

Tanimura: Fair enough. 

Zhao: So were the police trying to protect Katsuragi? If so, why?

Tanimura: Who knows? But they obviously couldn't let a scandal like that go public. 

Zhao: Hrm…

Chief Hisai: ...I just thought of something. 

Tanimura: Hm? 

Chief Hisai: Maybe we could dig something up at headquarters. 

Tanimura: Oh yeah? How? 

Chief Hisai: Archive Room 13 on basement level 3… The so-called Forbidden Room. 

Zhao: Forbidden Room!? 

Chief Hisai: That's right. Also known as the "Scandal Graveyard." All records of police misconduct over the years supposedly end up there. Or so the rumor goes. 

Tanimura: Interesting. Then we just might find something useful. 

Chief Hisai: Yes. Or, well, it could all simply be a rumor. 

Tanimura: Still, worth a shot. In fact... I'm all over it. 

Chief Hisai: Now hold your horses, Tanimura-kun! Think about it. Archive 13 is smack-dab in the middle of headquarters! A rookie like you can't just go strolling in there without permission. 

Tanimura: I never planned on asking. I mean, we're dealing with someone who can cover up mass murder. I doubt they'd be keen on giving me access to the evidence. 

Zhao: You serious about this, Ma-chan...? 

Chief Hisai: Tanimura-kun, I… No, nothing. 

Tanimura: So. We all ready to go? 

Chief Hisai: Huh? Wait... " We" as in you and me? 

Tanimura: Of course! Us Community Safety boys gotta stick together, right? Besides, I've only been to HQ maybe once or twice. I probably couldn't find this archive even if I tried. But you know right where it is, don't you, Chief? 

Chief Hisai: (wiping sweat) What? No, I... Well, I mean, yes, but be that as it may... 

Tanimura: Great! Then I'll be counting on you!

====Head to Police HQ====
Chief Hisai: Okay, let's go. We can get there by taxi. 

Tanimura: (Anything I gotta take care of before we go to HQ?) Sure, I'm all set. 

Chief Hisai: Okay, but we pay our own cab fare. Headquarters might start asking questions if we file an expense report. 

Tanimura: ……

Taxi Driver: The minimum fare is 710 yen. Where would you like to go? 

Tanimura: Headquarters, We're with the Tokyo Metro Police. 

Taxi Driver: Very well, sir. 

[In the “Forbidden Room”...]

Tanimura: (It's not this one… Why's this even in here? Not it… Nope…) Hey, I think I found it. 

Chief Hisai: You did...? 

The Assault on Yoshiharu Ueno 

1. Case Overview 

The attempt on Yoshiharu Ueno's life was carried out on April 21, 1985. 

Shortly after 12:00 noon that day, a lone gunman armed with six revolvers burst into a ramen shop located in Tokyo's Suginami Ward. 

Yoshiharu Ueno, chairman of the Ueno Seiwa Clan. was one of the 20 men shot inside, and one of the two who survived. 

The gunman was one Taiga Saejima, a 20-year-old member of the Tojo Clan. 

On the day of the incident, Ueno had just been released after serving a two-year prison term. With him were several top members of his clan. 

Tanimura: (This report is missing something... just like Katsuragi said. According to him, he should be the one listed as the killer. But all that's here is the part Saejima played.) 

2. Investigation 

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department formed a special investigation team led by detectives Taigi Tanimura and Junji Sugiuchi. 

Tanimura: (Dad... and Sugiuchi? They worked the case together? Why haven't I heard this before? What the hell's going on?) Huh... 

Chief Hisai: What did you find out? 

Tanimura: More than I expected. 

Chief Hisai: ……

Tanimura: Let's go. 

Hisai: What? Already? 

Tanimura: Yeah, I have a good lead. No point wasting any more time here. 

[They leave the Police HQ.]

Tanimura: Chief. I have a few things I need to check out. Why don't I see you later?

Chief Hisai: That’s fine. I'll be back at the station if you need me. Just don't do anything crazy, you hear? Your father wouldn't want you going out guns blazing over this. 

Tanimura: I wouldn't go that far... (I think I'll head back to Homeland for now. I need some time to digest all this.) 

Police Scanner: This is KPD dispatch. Homicide reported in front of the Mach Bowl bowling alley, near Theater Square. We have positive ID on victim. Koichi Yabe, a writer residing in Kamurocho. All officers in the area respond immediately. 

Tanimura: (A murder...)

[He got a call.]

Tanimura: Tanimura here. 

Officer: Are you listening to your radio? Get your ass over here, now. 

Tanimura: I don't get it. Why're you calling me about this? 

Officer: I didn't say for you to ask questions. Just get over here now. 

Tanimura: Yeah, yeah. Be right there. (What the hell? Oh well. Guess I'll head over to Mach Bowl.)

Tanimura: Hey, I’m here. 

Tanimura's Colleague: Yeah, so the stiffs a writer for the sex industry. Since you seem to be such an expert on the subject, I thought you might have some dirt on him. 

Tanimura: Did you call me out here just to give me shit? Oh, and what was his name again? 

Tanimura's Colleague: Make an effort to remember what you hear on the dispatch, Tanimura. His name's Koichi Yabe. 35 years old. 

Tanimura: Huh. Don't know who that is. 

Tanimura's Colleague: Are you sure about that? 

Tanimura: I'm telling you, I've never heard of him. 

Tanimura's Colleague: All right, then. Thanks. You can go now. 

[Tanimura walks away.]

Tanimura: (The murder victim was a sex industry writer. Something stinks about this.) 

[His phone’s ringing.]

Tanimura: Tanimura here.

Saki-chan: Hey, it's me. 

Tanimura: Hey, Saki-chan. 

Saki-chan: I heard Yabe was killed. 

Tanimura: Not bad for a former detective. You got your info quick. So, what do you know about this Yabe? 

Saki-chan: I wanted to talk to you about that. Let's meet at Shellac. 

Tanimura: Okay. Shellac it is. 

[Tanimura finds the bar.]

Saki-chan: Oh. Hi, hon. Turns out Yabe-san was on the cusp of something dangerous. 

Tanimura: What was it he investigated? 

Saki-chan: Not what, but who: a woman from Hong Kong. 

Tanimura: Huh. I take it she's not just some random lady. 

Saki-chan: Right. Rumor has it she has ties to a certain crime syndicate, and she's in charge of illegal immigrant workers... all of them female. 

Tanimura: So she's a crime boss, then. And this syndicate's supposed to be...?

Saki-chan: A powerful underground intelligence network spread throughout Asia. Apparently they recruit girls from poor families and make them buy fake passports and visas. Then they force them to work like slaves to work off the loans used to buy them. And when they're used up, they're history. 

Tanimura: Don't tell me... Bridge is the one running the show? 

Saki-chan: That's my guess. 

Tanimura: An idea where this crime boss lady might be? 

Saki-chan: I'm not entirely sure, but I hear the syndicate has an office near the arcade in Nakamichi Alley. I'm sure this goes without saying, but... be careful, okay? 

Tanimura: Thanks. I'll try. 

[He finds the place.]

Tanimura: (Behind the arcade... Bridge's syndicate should have an office around there. Should I go in? Okay, I'm going in.) 

Man in a Business Suit: Oh? And who might you be? 

Tanimura: Doesn't matter. I'm looking for the boss—some lady from Hong Kong.

Man in a Business Suit: ...Don't know what you're talkin' about. 

Tanimura: Don't play stupid with me. Just bring her here and there won't be any trouble.  

Man in a Business Suit: Ah, forgive me. Where are my manners? Hey fellas! Come help me escort our “guest”! Our friend here is requestin' a one-way trip to the afterlife. Shall we oblige? 

Tanimura: I get that your boss is a tough nut to crack, but you really don't have to make things so difficult... 

Man in a Business Suit: Give him hell, boys! 

[Tanimura kicks their asses, destroying the office in the process.]

Tanimura: So, a sex industry writer named Koichi Yabe was investigating a madam from Hong Kong and it got him killed. 

Man in a Business Suit: What… Yabe's dead!? 

Tanimura: So you knew him? 

Man in a Business Suit: ...I did. 

Tanimura: Tell me where this boss of yours is. 

Man in a Business Suit: She went back to Hong Kong this morning. 

Tanimura: I see. So she had to skip town to keep a lid on Yabe's murder... 

Man in a Business Suit: Let's just say she learned too much about the organization for her own good. 

Tanimura: Are you talking about the organization that Bridge runs? 

Man in a Business Suit: Bridge? 

Tanimura: What, you never heard the name? 

Man in a Business Suit: We're not important enough to know what's going on up top. All I know is that the boss leaked something to Yabe.

Tanimura: And now that Yabe's dead. I guess we'll never know what that was. 

Man in a Business Suit: Don't be so sure about that. Yabe apparently hid whatever he compiled somewhere. 

Tanimura: Really!? Where? 

Man in a Business Suit: Dunno. The organization's in a frenzy trying to find it. 

Tanimura: Interesting…

Man in a Business Suit: Are you gonna go look for it, too? 

Tanimura: You bet. I imagine it's some pretty valuable info. 

Man in a Business Suit: You ought to stay out of it. Or you'll end up just like Yabe 

Tanimura: Don't you worry about me. After giving me all these details, you should be watching your own back. (leaves)

Tanimura: (So Yabe hid some info, huh? But without any leads, I might as well be running in circles. There is that greedy old fortune teller... Guess I gotta rely on her again.) 

[He goes to Naomi.]

Naomi: I knew you would return. 

Tanimura: I'm trying to find the evidence Yabe, that sex industry writer, left behind. 

Naomi: Hrmmm... That’s no ordinary information you seek. It is going to cost you. 

Tanimura: How much? 

Naomi: 50,000 yen, and not a yen less. 

{It is about $437.}

Tanimura: Greedy, aren't we? Cut me some slack. I don't have that much. 

Naomi: Hmph, The Great Naomi has no use for penniless fools. Now, off you go! 

Tanimura: (Guess I'll have to pay the fifty thou...)

[He finds the money.]

Naomi: You wish to know about the information Yabe left behind? It will cost you 50,000 yen.

Tanimura: Man... I hope she gets this right. 

You paid 50,000 yen. 

Naomi: Heh, Naomi will not disappoint. Yes, yes... I see a place... Yabe... A bar frequented by the one they call 

Tanimura: Are you telling me you actually see that in your ball of glass there?

Naomi: Silence. Do you doubt the Great and Powerful Naomi?

Tanimura: No, it's not that. It's just kind of weird. Anyway, what's the bar's name?  

Naomi: ...Cuez Bar. 

Tanimura: The pool bar in the underground mall?

Naomi: Correct.

Tanimura: Thanks. I'll be back if this lead's a good one. 

[He finds the bar.]

Bartender: Welcome. 

Tanimura: Heya... You wouldn't happen to know a writer named Yabe, would you? Writes about the sex industry? 

Bartender: Oh, him. He was here two days ago. 

Tanimura: I see... Well, he's dead now. 

Bartender: No… It's because he got involved with that woman... 

Tanimura: You're not talking about the woman from Hong Kong, are you?

Bartender: You... know her? 

Tanimura: I know she's part of a crime ring. 

Bartender: Yes... Apparently she gave Yabe-san some rather vital information, to put it lightly. 

Tanimura: That's what I don't get. She must've known that would put her life in danger. 

Bartender: A lady in the throes of love tends to throw caution to the wind. 

Tanimura: Wait, she and Yabe were in love? 

Bartender: It's more like Yabe was a ladies' man. 

Tanimura: Ah, I get it. He must've seduced the information out of her. 

Bartender: And then he paid the price. 

Tanimura: Well, he's supposed to have hidden his information somewhere. Any idea where that might be? 

Bartender: What do you intend to do with it? 

Tanimura: I’ll use it to crush the syndicate once and for all.

Bartender: ...Can I trust you?  

Tanimura: You can. I'll do whatever it takes to prove it. 

Bartender: Okay then. He said it was in a locker in the underground mall. 

Tanimura: Thank you. 

Bartender: Yabe-san gave his life for that information. Don't let it go to waste. 

Tanimura: You weren't in love with him too, were you? 

Bartender: ...He was just a customer to me. That’s all.

Tanimura: Right. Well, see ya.  

[He goes to the lockers nearby and sees some yakuza are already there.]

Tanimura: (Damn... These bastards were one step ahead of me!) I’ll be taking that bag off your hands. 

Tough Guy: Ah, so you know what this is? Glad you showed up, then. Now we can get rid of you. 

[He kicks their asses and searches the bag.]

Tanimura: (So this is what Yabe gave his life for… a pile of papers. Hm? There's something else in here…  A ring and a letter... It says, “To Mitsuko.” That's the bartender… I should take these to her.) 

[In the bar.]

Tanimura: He was planning on celebrating your birthday with you. 

Mitsuko: I begged him not to get involved with that horrible woman... 

Tanimura: I guess he was going to use the info to write an exposé on the syndicate. 

Mitsuko: What exactly did he find out? 

Tanimura: Details of the syndicate's activities—recruiting Asian women, -counterfeiting passports, arranging fake marriages with Japanese men, operating brothels... 

Mitsuko: Is that enough to take down the syndicate for good? 

Tanimura: I'm not 100 percent sure this would qualify as conclusive evidence, but it could play a big role in exposing their operations, which could eventually lead to bringing them down. 

Mitsuko: Good. Tanimura-san, would you take this for me?

You got an Eye of the Dragon. 

Mitsuko: Yabe always wore it as sort of a lucky charm. It hurts too much to keep it now... 

Tanimura: Okay. Then I'll hold onto it for you. And I promise to use this information to get Bridge. Yabe-san won't have died in vain. 

Mitsuko: Thank you... 

[Tanimura returns to Homeland.]

Zhao: Oh, Ma-chan, you're back. How'd the thing go? 

Tanimura: Well, I found the case report for the hit. 

Zhao: You did!? What did it say!?

Tanimura: A lot of stuff I already knew, plus one new piece of info. 

Zhao: Oh?

Tanimura: Sugiuchi was investigating that case... along with my dad. 

Zhao: Sugiuchi? The same one that's always giving you hell back at the station?

Tanimura: Mhm. I've talked to him more times than I care to remember, but he never once mentioned being on a case with my dad. And that's despite him knowing how bad I want the truth. 

Zhao: ……

Tanimura: That's not the worst of it, either. I'm starting to believe someone on the force did my father in. Katsuragi said as much when we met yesterday. 

Zhao: Another officer... Things just keep getting better, huh? 

Tanimura: Seriously... 

Zhao: Why don't you call it a day, Ma-chan? Even you need to rest at some point. 

Tanimura: ...You're right. I think I'll knock out for a while. 

Zhao: You do that. Hey, Mei Hua! Get Ma-chan's futon ready!

Chapter 4: A DETECTIVE’S HONOR
The next day…

[Tanimura sits on the couch and looks at the briefcase with 100 million in it. Zhao enters.]

Zhao: So, are you going to launch an internal investigation?

Tanimura: Not yet. There's something I need to do first. 

Zhao: What? Don't tell me you're taking off with the money... 

Tanimura: Yeah, I'm totally skipping town... Actually, I'm taking it back to its original owner.

Zhao: Oh? Who is that? 

Tanimura: Some moneylender, apparently. He's got an office on Tenkaichi Street called Sky Finance. Can you imagine how much interest 100 million yen would rack up if I just let it sit? Yeah. Forget that. 

Zhao: Hrmmm…

[He walks towards the exit.] 

Mei Hua: Bye, Ma-chan! Have a good day! 

Tanimura: Oh, I'll try. See ya later. 

====Head For Sky Finance====
Tanimura: (Huh... So Sky Finance was here all along...) 

[He enters the office.]

Tanimura: Hello? Anyone home?

[Akiyama sleeps on the couch as usual.]

Akiyama: Can I help you?

Tanimura: Are you... Akiyama-san?

Akiyama: Last I checked. 

Tanimura: Do I know you from somewhere? 

Akiyama: Wait, you're that guy!

[He recalls how Arai kills Ihara near Sky Finance.]

Tanimura: Huh. So you're the one who lent Yasuko-san that 100 mil.

Akiyama: Yasuko? Don't you mean Lily-chan? How do you know her real name?

[Tanimura tells Akiyama everything.]

Akiyama: So that's her story…

Tanimura: She didn't tell you any of this? 

Akiyama: Nope, never asked. I figured it was something serious, but dang. Borrowing enough to put a hundred millionaires in debt, all to save your wrongfully accused brother on death row... I just wish she'd have come to me earlier. Might have saved her from going down a dark path. 

Tanimura: Well, now that Katsuragi's broken his promise, we can at least put the money issue to rest. Here. I'm sure she'd want you to have this.  

Akiyama: Nah. I'm good. 

Tanimura: Wait... What? 

Akiyama: I'm saying I won't accept the money. We're straight. 

Tanimura: Okay, explanation please? 

Akiyama: Regardless of how things went down, I lent that money to her. Isn't it only right that she be the one to return it? 

Tanimura: I dunno... Won't that leave a big, gaping hole in your account? 

Akiyama: Detective, I have so much money, I hardly know what to do with it. And I'm not interested in making more. As for the 1m million, I couldn't give a rat's ass if I never saw it again.

Tanimura: Why?  

Akiyama: You see, I only lend money to people I feel are worth investing in. That way, I can see how my loan affects their life. And that's a much more meaningful reward than seeing numbers on a spreadsheet.  

Tanimura: Not sure I understand your logic, but okay. 

Akiyama: Point is, person. I'm not taking that money. Not till she returns it in person. Where is she, anyway? 

Tanimura: Okinawa. Her brother was transferred to a prison there a few days ago. She said she wanted be near him on his execution date. 

Akiyama: I knew she was a keeper. 

Tanimura: What? 

Akiyama: Did I not mention? I fell for her. 

Tanimura: What, like, in love? 

Akiyama: Exactly. So I'd really like to see her again. Unfortunately, that money's the only connection between us now. If I take it back from you, the connection is cut, and I'll probably never see her again.

Tanimura: Some say love lasts only as long as the money. 

Akiyama: Heh, ain't that the truth. Pretty sad, huh? Almost as sad as this Arai-san business. 

Tanimura: Arai?

[Akiyma’s phone rings.]

Akiyama: One second. 

[He walks in the other corner of the office.]

Akiyama: Hello? Oh, Kido-chan. How you been? Found Arai-san yet? What? Mishima? You mean the Ueno goon without a bullet in his head? Uh-huh. Yeah. All right. Okay, leave it to me. I'll get back to you. Bye. 

[He returns to Tanimura.]

Tanimura: Who was that? I heard something about finding Arai. 

Akiyama: That was Kido, Arai's right-hand man. 

Tanimura: What? 

Akiyama: I might as well tell you now. I'm helping Kido find his boss, Arai. He's a good kid. 

Tanimura: Why? 

Akiyama: Because I can't afford to lose Arai-san. Shibata's boys are going nuts trying to find him. They're trying to appease the Ueno Seiwa by handing him over. We have to find him somehow before they get their hands on him. Of course, if what you just said is true, I've been betting on the wrong horse. 

Tanimura: What's your connection with Arai, anyway? 

Akiyama: I've been backing him out of personal interest. I'm not a mob front or anything. Still, this whole thing's been a real kick in the sack. Who'd imagine Arai-san would be in bed with Katsuragi? I never pegged him as the type to make a move like that. 

Tanimura: So, what exactly was that call about? 

Akiyama: Hm? Oh, that. Kido-chan was looking for Arai-san when he stumbled across the other Ueno goon. You know, the one that disappeared after the shooting? 

Tanimura: There was another one? 

Akiyama: Guy named Mishima. He was sworn brothers with Ihara, the guy Arai ventilated downstairs. 

Tanimura: So, what about him? 

Akiyama: He's asking for police protection. In exchange, he says he'll cough up all he knows. 

Tanimura: He wants the police? 

Akiyama: He wants a detective he can trust. One that can protect him from the Ueno Seiwa Clan. 

Tanimura: ……

Akiyama: I think you should go talk to him. 

Tanimura: Me?

Akiyama: Yeah, you're a perfect fit. I mean, based on what you said, the force sounds like a total snake pit. Plus you can't count on Sugiuchi-san or your superiors. What better person than you? 

Tanimura: Why should I? 

Akiyama: Who knows? It might get you a step closer to the truth you're looking for. 

Tanimura: How do you figure? 

Akiyama: The recent shooting between the Ueno Seiwa Clan and Kanemura Enterprises, right? I've got this hunch it’s all connected to the case your old man was working back in '85. There's just too much overlap between the main players to be a coincidence. 

Tanimura: ……

Akiyama: If Arai-san's been taking orders from Katsuragi on the sly… Maybe the bullet in Thara's head was all part of the plan.

Tanimura: Yeah. A small piece of Katsuragi and Shibata's plot to seize the Tojo.

Akiyama: Which is where Lily-chan comes in. Katsuragi turns on his partner Shibata. And uses her to erase anyone who knew what really happened that day in '85. A real-life femme fatale. What I'm not piecing together is, why do all that now? He could have snuffed them out decades ago if he wanted. So why now?

Tanimura: He panicked.

Akiyama: Yeah. Something set him off for sure. Before he got rid of Ihara… He had to be certain everyone who knew the truth about '85 was out of the picture. But why?

Tanimura: Maybe he was under orders. Could be someone else pulling the strings.

Akiyama: Any idea who?

Tanimura: Someone who can't afford to let the truth slip out. Like the top police brass who staged the cover-up.

Akiyama: The pieces do fit. Meaning you've got a rat on the force. So? You gonna meet up with Mishima? I think it's worth your time.

Tanimura: Agreed. I'm going. But I'm setting a trap.

Akiyama: Oh? What do you mean?

Tanimura: This Mishima guy… If he's really the sole survivor of that shooting, he has to know something.

Akiyama: Uh-huh. What's your point?

Tanimura: He's a liability. Not just for Katsuragi… But for the traitor on the force, too.

Akiyama: I get the picture. You call in your little rendezvous with Mishima… And hope the traitor comes running. It's a risky proposal. You sure you're ready?

Tanimura: Positive. Far as I'm concerned… I'm either gonna solve this thing or die trying.

Akiyama: Mishima's supposedly hiding over at the docks on Tokyo Bay. Your best bet is to take a taxi there... Unless, of course, you have a fancy cop car. 

Tanimura: Thanks for the advice. (Now, to report my next move to the station...) Hi, this is Tanimura from Community Safety. Can I get someone in Organized Crime, please? Yeah, anyone there will do. Thanks. ...Hi. This is Tanimura from Community Safety, reporting in. I just wanted to check in before I go meet with a yakuza member named Mishima, a material witness to that shooting in Kamurocho the other day. I'm meeting him over at the docks on Tokyo Bay. Yes, that's right. No, he's already there. Okay, thank you. Bye. (to Akiyama) Okay, now that that's taken care of, I'll be on my way. 

Akiyama: All right, just be careful. And good luck. 

====Meet Mishima At The Pier====
Tanimura: (Mishima's supposed to be hiding in a warehouse on the docks. Getting there by cab would draw the least attention.) 

Taxi Driver: The minimum fare is 710 yen. Where would you like to go? 

Tanimura: Docks.

Taxi Driver: Very well, sir. 

[Tanimura enters the dark warehouse at the dock. Peering into the darkness, he raises his hands. Mishima comes toward him with a revolver in his hands.]

Mishima: Who's there!?

Tanimura: Tanimura, Kamuro P.D. A little bird told me you were looking for police protection.

Mishima: Yeah. So you're the cop.

Tanimura: Which would make you Mishima from the Ueno Seiwa.

Mishima: Are... Are you a detective? 

Tanimura: Yeah. I’m here to place you under protection. 

Mishima: Okay... And you really think you can keep me safe? 

Tanimura: Only if you keep your part of the bargain. You give me the dirt on what the Ueno Seiwa's been doing behind the scenes and I'll make sure you stay out of harm's way. 

Mishima: Then... That's a deal. I'll talk. It's like this: me and Ihara were ordered to go make a scene at Club Elnard. 

Tanimura: Why? 

Mishima: Dunno. Nobody said. Katsuragi just told us to stir shit up. So we followed his orders. But then that prick showed up. 

Tanimura: Akiyama from Sky Finance? 

Mishima: Yeah, Akiyama. He fucked up the entire game plan. I don't remember nothing after he busted that bottle over my head. Next thing I knew, I was in the Champion District. Ihara must have carried me over. Woke up surrounded by bins, no sign of Ihara anywhere. 

Tanimura: Why the Champion District? 

Mishima: The two of us get shitfaced there a lot. That, and it’s close to Elnard. Ihara must've been freaking out... I bet someone was chasing him if he ditched me like that. I started looking for him so I could find out what happened and figure out our next move... I had no idea what a shitstorm this whole thing had become. Anyway, I'd been walking around Kamurocho for a while when... I found him. 

Tanimura: His body, anyway. 

Mishima: I practically puked when I saw that. I couldn't even process what was going on, you know? All I knew was I was scared shitless. So I ran as far as I could. I ended up at Ueno Seiwa headquarters. but I barely remember how I got there. Found an empty room there to chill the fuck out. Thought I'd catch my breath and try to digest all the shit that just went down. That's when I heard Katsuragi. He was in the next room talking to somebody on the phone. 

Tanimura: What did he say? 

Mishima: Can't say I heard everything. He was in another room and he'd already been talking a while. But it sounded like he was talking to the cops. The word “police” came up a lot. But it's what he said next that freaked me out. He said, “Ihara's dead, just as planned. We'll get rid of Mishima as soon as we find him.”

Tanimura: ……

Mishima: I got the fuck out right then and there, thankfully before anybody  saw me. I've been keeping it low-pro ever since. I'm as good as dead if you don't do something! Toss me in jail if you have to. Please, just save me!

Tanimura: All right. You can shack up with me for now. Just until I can arrange some more official accommodations, that is.

[But someone behind Tanimura shoots Mishima.]

Tanimura: (looking into the darkness) Who's there? 

[The killer comes to the light…]

Tanimura: Sugiuchi-san!

[Sugiuchi points his revolver at Tanimura.]

Sugiuchi: You're one surprise after the next, kid. Getting this close to the truth, and all by yourself? I'm damn near impressed. 

Tanimura: ……

Sugiuchi: You don't seem too fazed by all this. 

Tanimura: Let's just say I had a feeling you'd show up. 

Sugiuchi: Heh, so you baited Organized Crime to see if you could lure out the traitor? 

Tanimura: Something like that. 

Sugiuchi: And you're not surprised to see it's me. 

Tanimura: Not really. Though I can't say I wanted it this way.

Sugiuchi: How'd you know it was me? A gambler's dumb luck? A detective's hunch?  

Tanimura: Sugiuchi-san, a good hunch comes from keen observation. Didn't you learn that back at the academy? 

Sugiuchi: Heh, must've slipped my mind. So? What tipped you off? 

Tanimura: I've known you were no ordinary cop for a while now. 

Sugiuchi: ……

Tanimura: It's your fancy shoes. They always look brand new. Not exactly practical for a Homicide cop working murder scenes. A normal cop buys cheap shoes and wears them into the ground. The watch, too. It's way too expensive for a detective's salary. It's so high-end, I doubt your average person's ever even heard of the brand. And if they did, their heads would explode at the price tag. 

Sugiuchi: Heh, well don't you have it all—instincts and a sharp eye. 

Tanimura: Please, Sugiuchi-san. You really think it was all me? 

Sugiuchi: Huh? 

Tanimura: You haven't exactly been subtle. The rescue you staged when I met up with Katsuragi. Sending Chief Hisai ahead to Homeland. It almost feels like you've been wanting me to catch on. 

Sugiuchi: What are you talking about? 

Tanimura: You've been working with Katsuragi for the last 25 years. But now you've grown tired of your little partnership, haven't you? 

Sugiuchi: ……

Tanimura: I paid a visit to Archive Room 13. I saw the report on the Ueno Seiwa hit. 

Sugiuchi: What..!? 

Tanimura: You and my dad were both assigned to that case. Only the two of you could've covered up something as big as Katsuragi butchering 18 of his own people. And I know it wasn't him. 

Sugiuchi: ……

Tanimura: You were ordered by someone up top to alter the facts, weren't you? All to protect your good friend Katsuragi. Tell me I’m wrong! 

Sugiuchi: (shoots near Tanimura) ...You shut your goddamn mouth. You don't know the first fucking thing about that case. Or about me! 

[Suddenly the lights come on and dozens of police officers run into the warehouse! They surround Sugiuchi! We hear the voice of our old pal Junichi Sudo!]

Sudo: Not another step!

Sugiuchi: What the!?

Sudo: It's over, Sugiuchi. We know you've been collaborating with Katsuragi from the Ueno Seiwa Clan. Don't make this any more difficult than it already is.

Sugiuchi: Dammit...!

Tanimura: Sugiuchi-san. It's time to give it up.

Sugiuchi: (laughs madly) (speaks loud and aggressive) You morons don't understand a damn thing!

Tanimura: Sugiuchi-san.

Sugiuchi: So you know who I work with. Who cares? I'm untouchable! Later.

[He tries to just leave.]

Sudo: Don't move!

Sugiuchi: Or what, your boys'll shoot me? Anyone pulls the trigger and you're through. Japanese police can't shoot. And you damn well know it. Prove me wrong.

Tanimura: Chief! Why are you hesitating? Give the order!

[Sudo hesitates.]

Sugiuchi: (smirks) See what the "justice" everyone loves so much chalks up to? Absolutely nothing. There's a lesson for you, kid. Be seeing you.

[Sugiuchi turns around and goes to the exit, but Tanimura shoots at the door.]

Tanimura: I'm not afraid to shoot.

Sugiuchi: Tanimura!

Tanimura: I've never been one for playing by the rules. Sorry… But I've got my own brand of justice!

Sugiuchi: (laughs) Tanimura. I always knew you'd grow into your uniform. You're the first one in my 30 years who's really deserved it. So congrats.

Tanimura: Wow, I'm honored.

Sugiuchi: All right, kid. Let's see how far your justice takes you. Hope you're up to the challenge! (runs away)

Tanimura: Stop!

[He runs after Sugiuchi, but he jumps into a motorboat moored near the warehouse.]

Tanimura: Sugiuchi!

Sugiuchi: So long, Tanimura!

Tanimura: Shit!

[He jumps into another motorboat and chases Sugiuchi.]

Tanimura: Won't be that easy!

[Pursuing Sugiuchi, Tanimura shoots him in the motor. Eventually Sugiuchi's motor breaks down and he has to dock at the shore. He tries to run away, but Tanimura shoots him in the shoulder.]

Sugiuchi: You... just don't know when to quit, huh? Have it your way. Your old man? That was me.

Tanimura: What?

Sugiuchi: I'm the one who killed your dad. And now you're next, kid!

[He shoots off the revolver in Tanimura’s hands. Tanimura runs at Sugiuchi, knocks the gun out of his hands and handcuffs him.]

Tanimura: No more running!

Sugiuchi: You think some goddamn handcuffs… Is all it's gonna take!? (screams) Tanimura!

[They start fighting… handcuffed to each other. After a few seconds of combat, Sugiuchi manages to break the chain with a shot. An epic fist fight begins! Sugiuchi proves to be a tough and strong opponent, capable of holding on his own, but the agile Tanimura goes all out to avenge his father. And he wins.]

Tanimura: (points a gun to Sugiuchi lying on the ground) Now tell me! Tell me who murdered my father! Who dumped his body in the Arakawa 25 years ago!? Huh!? Say it! Say it!

Sugiuchi: Already have. It was me. What's wrong? Can't pull the trigger?

Tanimura: (in tears) Why…? Why's it have to be you? Tell me! What would make an honest cop betray his own partner!?

Sugiuchi: Sorry, but you got it all wrong. I'm not honest. Or even a cop. Never have been. From day one… I've been yakuza.

Tanimura: That's not possible.

Sugiuchi: Me and Katsuragi… We're what people in our world call brothers. Bound by oath.

Tanimura: The hell...?

Sugiuchi: My allegiance... has always been with the Ueno Seiwa. I joined the academy to be a spy. Got a badge to keep tabs on the cops. That's how it is.

Tanimura: You're… A yakuza?

Sugiuchi: That's right.

Tanimura: So then, 25 years ago... after the attempted Yoshiharu Ueno hit. My father found out Katsuragi was behind it all. And you murdered him in cold blood.

Sugiuchi: Wish it were that simple. The truth's a whole lot bigger.

[We jump back in time to the fateful day of April 20, 1985. After shooting Yoshiharu Ueno, Saejima leaves the ramen shop. Then Katsuragi rises to his feet... as do the rest of the Ueno Seiwa.]

Ueno Seiwa Yakuza: I'm... still alive?

[A cylindrical object falls from his jacket.]

Ueno Seiwa Yakuza: The hell's this?

Katsuragi: A rubber bullet. They're not lethal, but they sure pack a serious punch.

Ueno Seiwa Yakuza: Katsuragi? What are you talking about?

[Katsuragi shoots him in the head with a smile.]

Ueno Seiwa Yakuza 2: Katsuragi! The fuck do you think you're doing!?

[Katsuragi shoots him too. He goes from body to body shooting at the heads of everyone who hasn't had time to wake up. Sugiuchi enters.]

Sugiuchi: Brother. You finished?

Katsuragi: Yeah. Just need to end up in the hospital now.

[He hands his revolver to Sugiuchi.]

Katsuragi: Try not to hit anything too vital.

Sugiuchi: I won't. You'll be out in no time. And captain, too.

Katsuragi: As long as the old man's still kicking.

Sugiuchi: No worry there, though. He'll come to soon enough.

Katsuragi: The rest is on your shoulders.

[Sugiuchi shoots Katsuragi in the shoulder. After that he writes the report about the incident.]

Sugiuchi: That concludes my report on Taiga Saejima's attempted assassination of Yoshiharu Ueno.

Chief: I see. You've really done your work on this one.

Sugiuchi: All in a day's work, sir.

Chief: Oh? Is filing false reports part of your job, detective?

Sugiuchi: I'm not sure what you mean.

Chief: None of this adds up, Sugiuchi-kun. Did you think a report this slipshod could pull the wool over my eyes? Think about it. Our suspect Saejima faced 20 men in that tiny shop. Him alone, with no backup. He would certainly have been met with resistance. And yet, all 18 deaths… Were due to clean, perfect headshots. This Saejima fellow must be quite the distinguished marksman. There was one other item of note in the coroner's report. The day of the incident, not a single man was wearing a bulletproof vest. A careless mistake. However, this lack of protection led us to discover curious rubber bullet wounds on the bodies of all 18 men. You know what rubber bullets are, yes? The highly classified non-lethal rounds were developing for riot control. They're still undergoing tests, but they've been proven strong enough to knock a man out. I wonder. How did our suspect get a hold of experimental ammunition only the police know of? And what kind of deviant would knock his victims out with rubber bullets… Only to finish them off with a single slug between the eyes? A peculiar criminal indeed, this Saejima fellow. Then there's Katsuragi, the sole survivor aside from Yoshiharu Ueno himself. Escaped with a mere shot to the shoulder. Our suspect struck with deadly precision 18 times… only to mercifully spare Katsuragi?

Sugiuchi: Chief Munakata!

Chief Munakata: Sugiuchi-kun. I have a theory about this incident. That Katsuragi character likely orchestrated the whole thing. Thoughts? It would mean Taiga Saejima was simply Katsuragi's pawn. It's hard to believe a skilled detective like you failed to reach that same verdict.

Sugiuchi: Sir, I...

Chief Munakata: Sugiuchi-kun. I have a small favor to ask.

Sugiuchi: What is it?

Chief Munakata: Introduce me to Isao Katsuragi. If you can do that for me… I'll allow your report to stand as written. Do we have a deal?

[Back to our 2010.]

Tanimura: Munakata? As in... Deputy Commissioner of the Tokyo PD!?

Sugiuchi: That's the one. Guy's backed us for years. Ever since I turned that report in. You see what you're up against? You're in way over your head, kid. Man, that feels good. Been 30 years. 30 years I've lived this lie. No one to confide in. No one who'd understand me. You have any clue how tough that is?

Tanimura: Sugiuchi...

Sugiuchi: The hell have I been doing with my life? For decades now… Ever since the day I introduced Munakata to Katsuragi… I've been a goddamn lapdog. For cops and yakuza alike. And my own dream? It fizzled out years ago. You're one of the good ones. A real, honest cop. Lie or not, with 30 years on the force… I've gotten my fair share of praise. Been thanked countless times for my service. Every word of it tore my heart out. Made me wonder what I was even doing. I'd close a case. Get my pat on the back. And you know? Even though I knew it shouldn't have… It felt good. Somewhere deep in my heart. Truth is… Seeing you struggle, suffer, succeed… Made me wish I'd gone straight ages ago.

Tanimura: Sugiuchi-san...

Sugiuchi: Take me in. You did this all on your own. Avenged your old man. Brought me down. What's wrong?

Tanimura: I need to know something. What's Munakata trying to do? Why use you and Katsuragi like this? What's the point?

Sugiuchi: You've already accomplished your goal. I'm done. Best leave that stone unturned.

Tanimura: I can't do that! Not a chance. My father's out there somewhere, telling me to see this thing through. It's not over yet. Not until I drag Munakata to his knees.

Sugiuchi: If you try… He'll get every last cop in Japan on your ass. You sure you want that?

Tanimura: This is why I took up the badge. To find the truth about my father. I'll do whatever it takes.

Sugiuchi: That so?

[Sugiuchi gets to his feet and takes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. As he smokes, he looks up at the sky and blows a puff of smoke out of his mouth. He smiles at Tanimura and suddenly falls... he is hit by a bullet.]

Tanimura: Sugiuchi-san! 

[The killer leaves on the motorboat.]

Tanimura: Stay with me!

Sugiuchi: Tanimura...

Tanimura: What is it?

Sugiuchi: It wasn't just me. There's another traitor.

Tanimura: Who is it? Sugiuchi-san! Sugiuchi-san!?

Sugiuchi: After all these years… Finally… Some peace. Thank... you. (dies)

Tanimura: Sugiuchi-san! Don't die on me! Sugiuchi!

[Some time later, we see the office of Munakata who has aged over 25 years. He gets a call.]

Chief Minakata: I see. Sugiuchi's breathed his last. 

[The caller turns out to be... Chief Hisai... instead of the weird old man, we see a cold-blooded and intelligent killer.]

Chief Hisai: Yes, sir. Just as you ordered. Yes, sir. Both of them. Tanimura's associates are the only ones left. But not for long.

[We understand that Hisai is in Homeland, Zhao’s restaurant. He and his daughter are tied to chairs.]

Zhao: Bastard! What are you going to do to Ma-chan!?

[He slowly pulls out his gun. A shot rang out on the street...]

[PART 3 COMPLETE]

PART 4: KAZUMA KIRYU
Chapter 1: REUNION
[Morning. Okinawa. Beach. Someone emerges from the ocean and slowly walks towards Morning Glory Orphanage. It is Hamazaki. He holds a folder of documents (yes, it was documents) in his hand.]

Haruka: (leaving the house) Be back soon!

[She sees Hanazaki. Frightened, she drops the bag. Kiryu comes out.]

Kiryu: What's wrong, Haruka?

Hamazaki: Yo. Missed me?

Kiryu: It's you… Hamazaki!

[Evening. Hamazaki's wounds are bandaged.]

Hamazaki: Sorry 'bout this. Didn't mean to cause a scene. What's her deal?

Kiryu: You mean Haruka? Isn't it obvious? She despises you.

Hamazaki: Of course she does. Can't say I blame her.

Kiryu: By the way, Hamazaki. I know you broke out of prison. Why did you do it? It'll just add years to your sentence when they catch you again. You should know that.

[Hamazaki is silent.]

Kiryu: (sighs) A few days ago, another guy named Saejima washed up here. Funny enough, he mentioned your name.

Hamazaki: Wait, he was here!?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Hamazaki: Huh. So Saejima actually made it out alive… That's incredible.

Kiryu: You know him, then.

Hamazaki: Yup. And where is he now? He make it to Kamurocho?

Kiryu: That's where he said he was going. As for whether he actually got there… It's hard to say.

Hamazaki: Good… I'm glad.

Kiryu: So... what's the connection between you and this Saejima guy?

Hamazaki: We're brothers. Guy's practically my own flesh and blood.

Kiryu: Brothers, huh?

[Hamazaki kneels before Kiryu.]

Hamazaki: Kiryu! Please, I got a huge favor to ask!

Kiryu: What are you doing?

Hamazaki: I gotta help my sworn brother! I'm begging you! Hear me out just this once!

Kiryu: So, Hamazaki. What do you want? 

Hamazaki: Well, it's kinda a long story, but Saejima... He's the guy who bumped off Yoshiharu Ueno, chairman of the Ueno Seiwa, back in '85. 

Kiryu: Wait, that's... 

Hamazaki: Yup. You spend enough time in Kamurocho, you're gonna hear the story. Saejima killed eighteen men all by himself that day. 

Kiryu: That what they say. 

Hamazaki: Anyways, the two of us only just met. Both locked up in a private prison a stone's throw away from here.

Kiryu: What do you mean, “private” prison? 

Hamazaki: I mean, the government's not involved. They put the contract in place, yeah, but the private sectors been running the joint since the day they broke ground. They call it Okinawa Penitentiary No. 2. Take it you never heard the name? 

Kiryu: No. I had no idea a place like that existed in Okinawa. 

Hamazaki: They officially call it a correctional facility, but that's a load of bull. It's a dumping ground for washed-up yakuza they wanna snuff out for good. Was only a few days ago that Saejima got shipped down from whatever shithole they had him in up in Tokyo. 

Kiryu: Which is when you met. 

Hamazaki: Bingo. 

Kiryu: And you two planned the jailbreak together? 

Hamazaki: More or less. Though I'm the one who came up with the idea, if I'm being honest. 

Kiryu: Why'd you pick Saejima as your partner? 

Hamazaki: You saw him, right? Guy's built like a freaking brick wall. More importantly... I knew what really happened back in ‘85. The truth. 

Kiryu: Go on. 

Hamazaki: Back in the day, Saejima was real tight with Majima. Yeah, that Majima. And that Ueno Seiwa hit? The one where Saejima slaughtered those eighteen guys? That was originally gonna be a two man job. Saejima and Majima. 

Kiryu: Majima-san and Saejima were accomplices? 

Hamazaki: Yup. But the day of the attack. Majima never showed. That betrayal’s how I convinced Saejima to break out with me. 

Kiryu: Explains why Saejima was talking about revenge when he was here. 

Hamazaki: It’s all bullshit, though. Majima would never have betrayed his brother. They were both set up. 

Kiryu: By who? 

Hamazaki: Guy named Shibata. Was heading up a third-tier Tojo family at the time. Problem is, Saejima and I got split up before I got to tell him what really happened. 

Kiryu: I think I can guess the favor you want. 

Hamazaki: Yeah. You gotta tell him the truth. no matter what. 

Kiryu: Why is it so important? 

Hamazaki: As it stands, Saejima's gonna try and kill Majima. Not only that, but... 

Kiryu: But?

Hamazaki: But... I really respect him. He doesn't deserve to be living life in the dark, you know? 

Kiryu: Hm.

Hamazaki: I mean, sure, I only asked him to help me bust out 'cause of how tough he is. But he actually started trusting me during the escape. Me, of all people! 

Kiryu: ……

Hamazaki: Look. My life's been nothing but betrayal after betrayal, I’ve been on both sides of that coin. But two people looked beyond all that. Chose to trust me anyway. You... and Saejima. 

Kiryu: Hamazaki... 

Hamazaki: I want another chance. To start over, be a true brother to a guy who went out on a limb and actually trusted me. So I’m begging you, Kiryu-san. You gotta help me! (bows)

Kiryu: One question first. 

Hamazaki: What's that?

Kiryu: Why do you need me to do it? Can't you go tell Saejima all this yourself?  

Hamazaki: Well, I…

Kiryu: What is it, Hamazaki? 

[Hamazaki pulls out a document folder from the scraps of his blood-soaked clothes lying next to him.]

Kiryu: What's this?

Hamazaki: After I broke out, I was gonna use this to bargain with those police pigs. It's the record of them starting up Penitentiary No. 2 to operate outside the law. Shows the cash flow in and outta the place, too.

[Just one look at the documents shocks Kiryu.]

Kiryu: What the!?

“Tojo Clan → Kyohei Jingu” 10,000,000,000 yen
“Kyohei Jingu → Tokyo Metropolitan Police” 10,000,000,000 yen

{Kyohei Jingu is a corrupt politician from Yakuza Kiwami}

Hamazaki: See that? I'm sure you remember it. The ten billion that went missing from the Tojo Clan five years ago. Truth of the whole damn shitshow was… That cash was supposed to go to Penitentiary No. 2.
[Kirty recalls the events of Yakuza Kiwami.]

Kiryu: What does all that mean?

Yamazaki: A year back, when I was still suckling the Tojo Clan teat, I found out that the top brass over at the Tokyo PD had their hands dirty... real dirty, with tons of shady cash. Bet you can guess where I learned all that. 

Kiryu: The Snake Flower. 

Hamazaki: Yup. They’d been working with one of the top men on the force for years. Laundered his money through foreign banks and everything. 

Kiryu: Why go through all that trouble, though? What did the police need with all that cash? 

Hamazaki: What they needed... was to build what one of their highest-ranking boys called their “utopia.”

Kiryu: Penitentiary No. 2. 

Hamazaki: Right again. The idea was, they'd build a place to toss all the convicted yakuza they round up, then go and make deals with those very same yakuza. 

Kiryu: What kind of deals? 

Hamazaki: Stuff like bribing people to commit crimes. Then when the •cops came in and saved the day, everyone'd think they were the heroes. Crime would become a police-controlled affair. 

Kiryu: That's absurd. 

Hamazaki: Yeah, an absurd power grab. Whoever handled those “crimes” would get big brownie points on the force. End up rocketing up the ranks. 

Kiryu: I still can't believe the ten billion Jingu was trying to launder through the Tojo... was supposed to end up with the cops. 

Hamazaki: Believe me, I was just as surprised as you when I found out. Even with the money getting blown to high heaven, the paper trail alone is some serious shit. Honestly, the only reason I grabbed this file in the first place is 'cause I wanted a little dirt on the warden. Something I could use to bargain my way outta there, you know. But I gotta say, I never thought I’d stumble on a shitstorm this massive. Almost feels like it's outta my league, if you get me. I show up on Tokyo PD’s doorstep with this baby in tow and that'd be the last anyone ever hears of me. 

Kiryu: Hm…

Hamazaki: Turns out this file's not the bargaining chip I was hoping it'd be. It's yours now. 

Kiryu: But why me? 

Hamazaki: ‘Cause you were at the center of everything that went down five years ago. Hell, you even had to beat the shit outta your own brother at the end of it all. Then... 

[Kiryu stands up and walks towards the exit.]

Hamazaki: Kiryu? 

Kiryu: ……

Hamazaki: C'mon, don't gimme the silent treatment here.

Kiryu: I just don't get it. Why did you show me that?  

Hamazaki: I already told you. You gotta go to Kamurocho and tell my boy Saejima what really— 

Kiryu: (turns to Hamazaki)  There's more to it than that. I know there is. Besides, you would end up behind bars again in no time without this “bargaining chip” of yours. So tell me. Hamazaki. What are you really after?

[Hamazaki picks up the folder again and walks rto Kiryu.]

Hamazaki: Take a look at this.

[Kiryu sees a couple of handwritten notes on a document.]

“2010.4”
"Tojo Clan Destroyed”
“Kamurocho Hills => Ueno Seiwa Clan => Tokyo PD”

Hamazaki: With guys like us out in the cold… There's nowhere for the Tojo to go but down. Listen to me, Kiryu. You gotta take the reins of that Kamurocho bull. Because if you don't… The clan we've spent our lives propping up… is gonna get trampled to death.

[Kiryu ponders what Hamazaki has said, looking up into the night sky. Haruka discreetly peeks at him.]

March 9th, 2010
The next day…

[The children return from the trip.]

Taichi: Taichi in the house! 

Koji: Yo!

Ayako: We're home, Uncle Kaz! 

Kiryu: Looks like you kids had a good trip. You enjoy yourselves? 

Taichi: Oh yeah, it was awesome! We hiked, went camping, even saw some old bones and stuff at a museum! Wasn't it super cool, Koji?

Koji: Mhm! You gotta go with us sometime, Uncle Kaz! How was your grade's trip, Ayako? 

Ayako: Great! 

[She notices Hamazaki on a bench.]

Ayako: Hey, Uncle Kaz! Who's he?

Kiryu: That's Hamazaki-san. He's an old friend of—

Haruka: (entering) No! Don’t go near him!

Taichi: Haruka... chan?

[She shields the other kids from Hamazaki.]

Haruka: You're not coming any closer!

Kiryu: Haruka, please...

Haruka: Don't “Haruka” me! I still haven't forgiven him for what he did to you! Don't you remember, Uncle Kaz!? This is the same guy who stabbed you last year, remember!? And I had to watch while he did it!

Hamazaki: (smirks) She’s right. I'm one of the bad guys.

Kiryu: Hamazaki.

Hamazaki: Sorry about this, Haruka-chan. I’ll keep whatever distance you need. (leaves)

Kiryu: Haruka, that's enough.

Haruka: It's not enough! And it never will be! Uncle Kaz, you don't really trust Hamazaki, do you!?

Kiryu: Yeah. Actually, I do.

Haruka: Fine! But don't blame me when he betrays you again! (runs away)

You now have access to a hideout. Here you can save your game, move items to the item box, reminisce on past events and view your play stats. Furthermore, your health will recover while at a hideout. 

[Kieyu finds Haruka on the beach.]

Haruka: You're going back to Kamurocho, aren't you?

Kiryu: Haruka, I…

Haruka: I nast don't get it, Uncle Kaz. How can you trust him so easily? He stabbed you in broad daylight, Uncle Kaz! You almost died! I'll never trust him... Never in a million years. 

KIryu: Haruka, please. 

Haruka: Whenever I see him, I just think back to what happened last year. What he did to you. That memory terrifies me, Uncle Kaz. 

Kiryu: Haruka... 

Haruka: I’ve always believed in you. You know I have. But this time... I’m really worried. It feels like if you go to Tokyo now, you're never gonna come home. 

Kiryu: You heard us talking last night, huh? 

Haruka: Maybe you want to know what happened five years ago, but I don't care one way or another. I just want you to be safe. 

Kiryu: You don't care? Haruka, you lost both your parents in that incident. I lost Nishiki and Kazama-san. If there really was something more going on behind the scenes, wouldn't you want to know what it was? 

Haruka: I... I’m happy just being here with you, Uncle Kaz. That's all I need. Not the truth... Just you. 

Kiryu: Haruka…

Hamazaki: (suddenly approaches) Then you don't have to worry. Kiryu's not gonna be going to Tokyo. And one more thing. I'm shipping out now, too.

Kiryu: Hamazaki.

Hamazaki: My mind's made up. Saejima'll know the truth one way or another. Even if someone else has gotta help me. So, Kiryu-san. You can forget all about that file. Your life's here. It's not worth throwing that away.

Kiryu: And what about your life?

Hamazaki: Don't worry about that. I'm a tough bastard. I'll just kick back and wait for Saejima to get locked up again.

Kiryu: Hamazaki…

Hamazaki: Guess I’m gonna head down to the station now. Turn myself in.

Kiryu: Already? 

Hamazaki: Sooner the better, I figure. Anyway... I’ll be seeing you, Kiryu-san.

Kiryu: Hold on. Do you even know where the police station is? 

Hamazaki: I’m an adult, I got eyes. I'll find it. 

Kiryu: I’m coming with you, Hamazaki. We might have had our differences, but you at least deserve a proper send-off after all we've been through together. 

Hamazaki: Heh. Suit yourself. It's go time, Kiryu-san. You ready? 

Kiryu: Yeah. let's do it. 

[Kiryu and Hamazaki approach 琉球警察署 (Ryukyu Police Station). Next to the station, you can see a blue sign 振り込め詐欺対策実施中 (Countermeasures against bank transfer scams now in effect) and white one with a table 昨日の交通事故 (Yesterday's traffic accidents).]

Kiryu: You sure about this, Hamazaki? 

Hamazaki: One hundred percent. The only way I’m reuniting with Saejima is when we're both back in the slammer. 

Kiryu: Hamazaki... 

[They see a woman arguing with officers near the entrance.]

Woman: Please, why won't you listen to me!? Please, why won't you listen to me!? 

Policeman: You can say that all you want, lady, but I've never heard of this Penitentiary No. 2 you keep going on about. Now go home already! 

Woman: No, please! You have to listen to me! I'm begging you!

Policeman: We already have listened! 

Policeman: *sigh* Listen. I already told you, we looked through the logs of every prisoner shipped down here. Your brother isn't, and has never been, in an Okinawa prison. 

Woman: He is. I just know he is! Please, check for Taiga Saejima one more time! Please, officer! 

Kiryu: What!?

Hamazaki: Huh!? 

Policeman: You're wasting your time here, ma'am. Do yourself a favor and go home.

Woman: Wait, please!

[The policemen leave. Kiryu approaches the woman, who appears to be Yasuko Saejima.]

Kiryu: I couldn't help but overhear. Do you know Taiga Saejima?

Yasuko: Huh? Yes. Taiga is my brother.

Kiryu: Better not to talk in front of the station. I know this'll sound strange, but could we talk to you in private?

Yasuko: Why? Do you know something about my brother?

Hamazaki: Yup. Might even help you out if you play your cards right.

Kiryu: For now, let's find somewhere better to talk. Are you coming?

Yasuko: Yes.

[They enter some old office. Yasuko looks like she's pretty sure she's about to be raped.]

Hamazaki: The heck is this place, Kiryu? 

Kiryu: The ex-hideout of a family called the Tamashiro I crossed swords with last year. It's been empty for a while now. If there's anywhere we won't be interrupted, it's here. 

[They sit on the couches.]

Kiryu: So are you ready to talk? We might be able to find where your brother is if we pool all the information we have. 

Yasuko: Right... 

Kiryu: Now, you said you were Taiga Saejima's sister? 

Yasuko: That's right. My name is Yasuko Saejima. I… haven't seen my brother for twenty-five years now. Every single day, I tried to visit him in prison... but they never once let me in to see him. Not a single time in all those years. Then just a few days ago, I heard he was being transferred. To Penitentiary No. 2 down in Okinawa. 

Hamazaki: Hm...

Yasuko: As soon as they told me, I left Kamurocho and raced down here. But no matter how many times I ask, all the authorities insist such a place has never existed. 

Kiryu: That's what we walked in on. 

Yasuko: Yes. I'm at my wit's end here.

Hamazaki: ...Yasuko-san, yeah? Anyone who told you Penitentiary No. 2 doesn't exist either doesn't know the truth or was lying to you. It’s real, all right. 

Yasuko: What!? 

Hamazaki: I should know. I've been there.

Yasuko: You have!?

Hamazaki: Oh yeah. They gave it some fancy name and number like a regular old prison, but it's not actually government-run. You ever hear of a private prison?

Yasuko: Of course. And that's what Penitentiary No. 2 is? 

Hamazaki: Yup. Details are gonna have to come later, though. I've got some more important news for you first. Truth of the matter is... I know your brother.

Yasuko: You know Taiga!?

Hamazaki: Mhm. Oh, and here's another grain of truth for you. He's long gone from Okinawa. Probably reached Kamurocho by now if I had to guess. Me and him broke out together a few days ago. 

Yasuko: You... what? 

Kiryu: He's telling the truth. Your brother washed up at my orphanage the next day, and I ended up giving him some money to get up to Kamurocho. Sorry, Yasuko. You just missed him. 

Yasuko: In that case... I can't afford to waste any more time here. I need to get back to Kamurocho at once. 

[Suddenly Hamazaki notices something and walks to the window.]

Hamazaki: We got a situation here.

Kiryu: What's wrong?

Hamazaki: Looks like we're about to have some company. Prolly the cops. What's our move, Kiryu?

Kiryu: We can't waste time here explaining everything to the police. Let's get moving. Now.

Yasuko: Right.

[They run out of the office, but the police are already in the building.]

Kiryu: Dammit... We're too late. Those aren't cops. But then who are they?

Hamazaki: That's…

Saito: Finally found you, Hamazaki. Surprised you're still breathing. So that’s the bitch who went running to the police, begging to see Saejima. 

Yasuko: ……

Kiryu: Who are these guys, Hamazaki? 

Hamazaki: Guards. From that shithole “penitentiary” I was telling you about. These pricks are the cruelest goons in the business. 

Saito: Heh. Rich, coming from an escaped convict. 

Hamazaki: Look, I'll go back with you. Whatever I gotta do. Just... leave these two out of it. They don't got a damn thing to do with this. 

Saito: No can do. Don't worry, Hamazaki. We're not gonna kill you. But you're gonna need a serious attitude adjustment once we get you back in the slammer. Might have to beat you 'til you change. Either way... the bitch isn't going anywhere. 

Hamazaki: Why!? This is between you and me! 

Saito: Sorry, but warden's orders. He told me to bring him Taiga Saejima's sister, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. 

Yasuko: Me? But why would... 

Hamazaki: This is a load of bull! 

Kiryu: Hamazaki. 

Hamazaki: Huh? 

Kiryu: Take care of Yasuko-san.

Hamazaki: What? What're you saying, Kiryu? 

Kiryu: I'll handle the guards. You stay behind me and keep her safe. Understand? 

Hamazaki: …Yeah. (leaves with Yasuko)

Kiryu: You hear that? If you want to get to Yasuko, you're going to have to go through me. 

Saito: And who are you, tough guy? 

Kiryu: Someone who's spent almost a quarter of his life in prison. And I can tell... you're no ordinary guards. 

Saito: Hmph. Step aside, pal. Or who knows? We might just “accidentally” beat you to death. 

Kiryu: I think you'll find that's not as easy as you expect. 

Saito: Heh, your funeral. No more fucking around! Slaughter him! 

[Kiryu whirls furiously through the corridors of Tomashiro's former office. He fights Saito several times and finally defeats him.]

Hamazaki: You two go on ahead. This mess is mine to handle. And besides. Your brother's waiting for you.

Yasuko: Hamazaki-san! 

Kiryu: Are you sure?

Hamazaki: Dunno why, Yasuko-san... but someone's out for your head. Kiryu.

Kiryu: Got it. I'll make sure she gets to Kamurocho.

Hamazaki: Sorry 'bout this. Making you leave the kids behind and all.

Kiryu: I'm not doing it because you asked me to. Me going to Kamurocho is my own choice.

[The police sirens are blaring outside.]

Hamazaki: Then get moving! I’ll hold down the fort.

Kiryu: Okay. Let's go, Yasuko-san.

Yasuko: Right. Hamazaki-san… (bows) I can't thank you enough. I'm... proud to know my brother has a friend like you.

Hamazaki: Quit it with the flattery. Please.

Yasuko: I'll tell Taiga about everything you've done for me.

Hamazaki: Just go already!

Kiryu: He's right. Come on.

[They run out of the building. Hamazaki suddenly falls on the floor. There was a big bloodstain on his back.]

Hamazaki: Guess I... went a little too soft… Kiryu-san...

[He remains lying on the floor.]

Chapter 2: TO KAMUROCHO
[Suddenly we switch to Tanimura. He prays for the repose of two dead souls... When suddenly Zhao comes out of the office.]

Zhao: Leaving already, Ma-chan? 

[The items on the table are not name tags, but two police ID badges, Sugiuchi's and Hisai's.]

Tanimura: ...You know, Zhao-san? You've been a better friend to me than I've ever been to you. 

Zhao: Don't be ridiculous. You know that's not true. I'm just sorry the truth turned out to be so harsh. Your father, murdered by another man on the force... I can barely believe it. 

Tanimura: You're telling me. 

Zhao: Something about all this doesn't sit well with me... How will your father's spirit ever find peace? 

Tanimura: I think he'll be just fine.

Zhao: Hm?

Tanimura: Chief Hisai, Sugiuchi-san... They were tired of being used by Munakata and Katsuragi all these years. 

Zhao: Hm…

Tanimura: The two of them spent their whole lives serving others. But their final moments... Those were theirs, and theirs alone. They went out following their own brand of justice. 

Zhao: Ma-chan... 

Tanimura: Sugiuchi-san must've known telling me the truth of what happened 25 years ago was signing his own death warrant. But he did it anyway. And Chief Hisai... He took his own life in order to spare you, me, and Mei Hua. 

Zhao: That explains what he said into the phone before he shot himself: “Both of them will be dealt with.”

Tanimura: Yeah. Chief Hisai told Munakata I was dead so he'd stop coming after me. He spared my life so that I could do what's right. So that I could do what he never could. 

Zhao: You mean bring Munakata down? 

Tanimura: Exactly.

Zhao: But how are you gonna do that, Ma-chan? Munakata's one of the most powerful men in one of the top police institutions in the world.  

Tanimura: Well, I don't think I'll be getting much help from my fellow officers, that's for sure. 

[Akiyama enters the restaurant.]

Akiyama: Ni hao.

{Ni hao or 你好 is Chinese word for “Hello”}

Tanimura: Akiyama-san. 

Akiyama: Phew. The shit's really hit the proverbial fan, huh? 

Tanimura: You're telling me. Anyway, wha(s up? You wouldn't swing by here without a good reason. 

Akiyama: You know, sometimes it's depressing how sharp you are. 

Tanimura: What happened? 

Akiyama: District attorney's goons showed up at my office. Started tearing the place apart at the seams. Not to mention, they chucked me out on the street.

Tanimura: Wait, they're investigating Sky Finance? On what grounds? 

Akiyama: They said they're looking into some kinda coercion. The exact term's eluding me at the moment. Anyway, the issue is my tests. They said I'm forcing people to do stuff they don't want to do in exchange for money. Classic coercion case, I guess. 

Tanimura: Heh, it's like I can hear the words coming out of the DA's mouth himself.

Akiyama: Anyway, I didn't know where else to turn, so I thought I'd drop by here. Looks like I caught you at a bad time, though. Want me to come back later? 

Tanimura: No, your timing actually couldn't be better.

Akiyama: Oh yeah? 

Tanimura: Yeah. I need a hand with something, Akiyama-san. 

[Back to Kiryu, who just arrived in Kamurocho… again. He stands at the entrance to the district with famous sign 神室町天下一通り (Kamuro District Tenkaichi Street).]

{For those who don't know, the last character in the word 神室町 translates as "district", so it's not Kamurocho, but "Kamuro District". I think you've seen this word in the game more than once or twice!}

March 13th 5:00 PM

Yasuko: Kiryu-san…

Kiryu: This town looks the same as always… but I can tell something's not right here. 

[There are quite a few police officers on the street! They are looking around for suspects. Really strange for an area completely controlled by organized crime.]

Kiryu: There's no time to waste. Let's go find your brother.

Yasuko: Right.

Kiryu: But before we do. There's something I need to ask you. Follow me.

[They enter the district together.]

Kiryu: (Can't think of a better place to talk than New Serena.) Yasuko-san, there's a bar near here that I used to go to back in the day. We can catch our breath there for a bit. 

Yasuko: Okay, I'll follow your lead. 

[Kiryu walks up to his favorite bar and sees a truck and some movers next to it.]

Kiryu: (What's this truck doing here? Is someone moving?) 

[Deciding not to waste time, Kiryu walks into the bar. It looks like the bar has a new "mama.” Now it's more like “daddy.”]

Date: Just a minute! Kiryu!

Kiryu: Date-san. Here we are again.

Date: What's going on, Kiryu? You show up in a guy's bar and don't even drop him a line first? 

Kiryu: Sorry for not letting you know, Date-sam I have some business in town.

Date: …Work never ends for the ex-fourth chairman, huh? 

Kiryu: You've got that right. Anyway, this is Yasuko Saejima. I'm here helping her with a little something. 

Yasuko: (bows) It's nice to meet you. 

Date: Oh, the pleasure's all mine. She's a knockout, Kiryu. How'd you end up bringing a girl like her back here, huh?

Kiryu: Whatever you're thinking, I guarantee you've got the wrong idea. Let's leave it at that. By the way, where's Mama? 

Date: Gone for the week. Family trouble, you know how it goes.  

Kiryu: And you're holding down the fort while she's gone? 

Date: Yup. It's a real pain, what with my other work and all, but she insists we keep it open for the regulars. 

Kiryu: Lucky for us that she does. 

Date: Now, Kiryu. What's this “little something” you need to take care of? 

Kiryu: Oh, right. You mind taking a seat, Yasuko-san? 

Yasuko: Um…

Kiryu: Please. I just need to ask you something before we head out to find your brother. 

Yasuko: …Okay. 

[They sit at the counter.]

Yasuko: So, what is it you want to ask me? 

Kiryu: Sorry if this is a blunt question… But why do you need to see your brother so bad? Bad enough to murder for it? 

Date: Wait, you what!? 

Yasuko: Kiryu-san, is this really the best place to... 

Kiryu: Don't worry about Date-san. He's an ex-detective, yeah, but we can trust him. I promise. He'd never turn you in without hearing what you had to say first. Isn't that right, Date-san? 

Date: Well, uh... Yeah, that's right. 

Kiryu: Now tell me the truth, Yasuko-san. Why would you go so far for your brother? 

Yasuko: I…

Kiryu: Yasuko-san.

Date: C’mon.

Yasuko: It’s because... because Taiga is everything to me. I owe him my life. 

Kiryu: What?

Yasuko: I’m serious. If it weren't for him, I would have died years ago. 

Kiryu: Go on. 

Yasuko: Have you ever heard of a living-donor kidney transplant? 

Date: Oh yeah, you read about those things all the time. That's when they give you a kidney from one of your relatives, right? They say you only need one, after all. 

Yasuko: Right. The truth of it is... rm the recipient of one of those living-donor transplants. 

Date: And your brother's the one who gave it to you, huh? 

Kiryu: That's what you meant when you said you owe him your life. 

Yakuso: …Yes.

Date: Hold on. Getting a transplant like that from your sibling isn't all that uncommon. I'm not judging or anything, but do you really owe him that much just for a kidney?

Yasuko: It's not that simple. 

Kiryu: Think you can explain? 

Yasuko: The kidney I got... It wasn't Taiga's. He wasn't a match. 

Date: What, different blood types? 

Yasuko: Well, yes, but... 

Date: But what? Why couldn't you get the transplant from your brother? 

Kiryu: ...Yasuko-san? 

Yasuko: I, um…

Kiryu: I think I get what's going on here. You and Taiga aren't actually siblings. 

Date: Kiryu!

Yasuko: He's right. Taiga is my stepfather's son from his prior marriage, while my mother had me before she and my stepfather ever even met.

Date: Then where'd you find a match?

Yasuko: Since my mother had already passed... Taiga tracked down my biological father and begged him to donate his kidney to me.  

Kiryu: Saejima…

Yasuko: Beyond the regular difficulty of finding a kidney donor, my blood type is extremely rare. A direct relative was my only hope of a match. Once Taiga learned that, he spent every waking moment of his life scouring the city until he found my father. He was only 15 years old at the time. 

Date: Still just a kid, huh... 

Yasuko: I had honestly given up hope. Before my mother died, she told me my father was nothing more than an abusive drunk with no chance of ever changing. Based on what I knew, it seemed likely he was already dead. Even if he wasn't, I didn't want to live knowing I owed my life to such a horrible man. At the time, I would have rather died than continue on carrying a part of him inside me. 

Kiryu: ……

Yasuko: But Taiga wouldn't take no for an answer. He said no matter what happened, he would take care of me. 

Date: Then... he found your dad? 

Yasuko: Yes. 

Date: Well? Where was he?

Yasuko: In Kansai. He had started working for a yakuza organization called the Omi Alliance. Handling the dirty jobs nobody else wanted to touch.

{Kansai is a region of western Japan on Honshu Island. The area is home to Sotenbori, one of fictional districts in Osaka, where Majima and Saejima lived. It is approximately 503 kilometers (312 miles) or 5 hours and 48 minutes by train from Tokyo to Osaka. You can learn more in Yakuza 0.}

Date: The Omi!?

Yasuko: That's right. Taiga went alone to Kansai, knowing full well that my father was a yakuza, but...  

Kiryu: Let me guess. They tried to extort him. 

Yasuko: Exactly. A yakuza through and through, my father demanded massive sum of money in exchange for one of his kidneys. 

Date: How much cash are we talking here? 

Yasuko: Thirty million yen. 

{30 million yen is about $264,000.}

Date: Thirty mil!? That’s a ton now, but it was a fortune back then! How was a kid ever supposed to get his hands on that kind of money!?

Yasuko: He wasn't. That was the point. But Taiga didn't give up. He started fighting thugs in the streets of Kamurocho, trying to scrape together whatever funds he could. 

Date: That would never work. Not for cash like that. 

Yasuko: It didn’t. Not until Sasai-san from the Tojo Clan stepped in. He gave Taiga the thirty million under one condition: he join the Sasai Family. 

Kiryu: So that's how he ended up in the Tojo. 

Yasuko: All that time, Taiga never turned his back to me. Even when it seemed like all hope was lost, he supported me. He dropped out of high school, gave up on his dream of becoming a teacher, even joined the yakuza for me... 

Kiryu: So that's what you meant when you said you owe him your life. 

Yasuko: That’s right. He's everything to me. Not only did Taiga literally save my life, but he gave me the will to keep on living. 

Kiryu: Yasuko-san... 

[Yasuko sheds a tear.]

Yasuko: To be frank… don't really care whether or not he killed those eighteen men. Even if the real killer is still at large. None of that matters. Whatever happened... Taiga is still my brother.

[Kiryu stands from his chair.]

Kiryu: I need you to stay here for now. Try to relax, calm down a bit.

Date: That's cold, Kiryu. Can't you see how bad she needs this?

Kiryu: Yasuko-san. Imagine you found out Saejima was already dead. What would you do then? Take your own life? Yasuko-san. You keep saying you owe Taiga your life. And I get it. We all rely on other people. It’s hard to keep going without someone loving you, supporting you, pushing you onward. But in your case, Taiga became more than that. He's not just your support. He's your reason to keep living. 

Yasuko: I…

Kiryu: I know life hasn't been easy for you. Losing your parents is one of the worst pains imaginable. and you had to bear that burden at a far younger age than most. But having a hard life doesn't excuse the way you’ve lived. 

Yasuko: Ngh…

Kiryu: Not that I have any right to talk. I've made my fair share of mistakes. 

Date: Kiryu... 

Yasuko: …..

Kiryu: I understand why you feel so strongly, but that emotion has led you to some bad decisions. It’s not a stretch to say it's completely clouded your judgment. So, I need you to stay here while I go figure out where your brother is. It's for your own good. 

Yasuko: But…

Date: Kiryu…

Kiryu: Don't worry, I'll find him. And I'll make sure you two are reunited. I promise. But for now, you just need to be patient. Okay? 

Yasuko: …Yes. Thank you.

Kiryu: Thank you, Yasuko-san. (to Date) Take care of her for me, will you? 

Date: Heh, do you even have to ask? 

[Kiryu leaves New Serena.]

====Find Saejima====
Date: Hold on a set, Kiryu. 

Kiryu: What's wrong?

Date: There's something I need to tell you. Couldn't really say it in there. 

Kiryu: Does it involve Yasuko-san? 

Date: You bet. If she found out about this, she'd just end up getting herself into more trouble. 

Kiryu: Well? What is it? 

Date: Well... You only just got here so you probably haven't noticed, but the whole town's been kinda on lately. 

Kiryu: Because of Saejima? 

Date: Partially, I'm sure. But there's more to it than that. Word on the street is, Majima and Saejima linked up a few days ago. 

Kiryu: What!? 

Date: Yup. I hear Majima had his boys line the whole damn street to keep the cops off Saejima. 

Kiryu: Huh. So they've already met. Speaking of, Date-san... do you know where I can find Majima-san? I need to talk to him as soon as possible. Not just about Saejima. Majima-san might be able to tell me more about the connection between the top police brass, Jingu, and the Tojo Clan. 

Date: The police? What are you talking about?

Kiryu: Sorry, but I can't say much more than that. Just know that people are gunning for the Tojo. And no matter what's going down, I need to hear Majima-san's side of the story. 

Date: All right. Last I heard, he'd taken root up on the top floor of the Millennium Tower. Starting there's your best bet. 

Kiryu: Great. Thanks, Date-san. 

[Date leaves.]

Kiryu: (Hm? I got an email.)

Rematch from 4 years ago
hinekure_curve_2005@...
Kiryu,
Come to Yoshida Batting Center. Let's finish what we started 4 years ago.

Kiryu: (“Four years ago,” huh? That could be just about anybody. Guess I'll find out what it's about if I drop by Yoshida Batting Center.) 

[On the way…]

To my dear apprentice
sotarokomaki@... 
Komaki here. It's been ages. 
Kiryu, if you're here in Kamurocho, come see me. 
I'll be waiting at my dojo in the Dragon Palace. 

Kiryu: (It’s a text from Master Komaki. I wonder if he had one of his apprentices write this… Komaki Dojo is inside Dragon Palace on Park Boulevard. I should probably stop by when I have the time.) 

[Kiryu approaches Yoshida Batting Center. There’s a lot of people cheering for someone outside…]

Agent: Kazuma Kiryu-san, yes? 

Kiryu: Who's asking? 

Agent: My name is of no importance. I take it you read the email? Please, step inside. 

Kiryu: (Guess I'm going in...) 

[Kiryu enters the building. A strange guy in an expensive suit and a silly, out of style brown cap is waiting for him there.]

Mystery Man: Kiryu! I've been waiting! 

Kiryu: Do I know you? 

Mystery Man: Hehe, Mm not surprised you don't remember me. But I've had you on my brain nonstop these past four years. Don't tell me you forgot what you said to me? You felt like swinging a bat around... and we were gonna be the curveballs. 

Kiryu: If you say so. I say a lot of things to a lot of punks. 

Mystery Man: That didn't jog your memory!? But the nickname stuck with me ever since! I’ve had guys calling me Curveball for years! Think, man! You got in a fight here with a gang called the B-Kings, and I'm their leader! Or I was, at least. 

Kiryu: Oh, right. You're the ones who went after Takashi when he tried to leave the gang. Heh, I thought you were just some random punk. Looks like you've done pretty well for yourself in the meantime, though. I take it those are your fans outside?

{I think he means the encounter in December 2006 from Yakuza Kiwami 2. It begins about Chapter 10.}

Curveball: Heh, you bet they are. I take it you don't keep up with this kinda stuff, so lemme fill you in. These days, everyone knows me as professional baseball superstar Keisuke Baba. I've made more TV appearances than I can remember. 

Kiryu: Oh yeah? 

Baba: Yeah. In other words, I don't have a lot of open slots in my schedule. Yet here I am, asking you out to a dump like this. You know why? 

Kiryu: You said in your message you wanted to settle things. 

Baba: That's right. It's been gnawing at me all this time. You tried to make me out to be the bad guy back in the day, but Takashi's the one who made the wrong choice. That's when I decided I was gonna prove that I was right. Everyone needed to know the truth. 

Kiryu: So you... started playing baseball? I don't think I see the connection. 

Baba: Of course you don't. You see, the very concept of “right” boils down to nothing more than whatever the powerful say it is. You've seen those self-help books where successful people tell you how to be successful yourself, right? Having power makes everything you do valid, man. As long as you're powerful, right and wrong don't matter to you. Everything you do becomes right! And whatever came before was just a step on your path to success. So by becoming rich and famous, I'm proving that all the choices I've made up 'til now were the right ones. 

Kiryu: Heh. That's the same kind of logic that got your crown knocked off in the first place, B-King. 

Baba: Finally remembered, huh? Good.

Kiryu: So now what? Don't tell me you want to slug it out again? 

Baba: I told you, I'm a major-leaguer now. And there's only one way major-leaguers settle things: with a bat and ball. Here, I'll make the rules simple for you. I throw ten pitches, and if you can get a clean hit off even one of them, you win. Fair enough? 

Kiryu: Sounds pretty generous. I can close my eyes and swing randomly and I'd probably still hit at least one. 

Baba: Heh, not against my secret weapon, you can't! Swing all you want against my Twisted Curve... You'll come up empty every time!

[Kiryu successfully strikes Baba's pitch.] 

Baba: What the! 

Kiryu: Looks like I win. 

Baba: Heh. Hehe. You're really something, you know that? Most pros can't even sniff out that pitch, but here you are whacking it around like it was a freaking softball. Hey, Mike! 

Agent: Yes, Baba-san? 

Baba: Get me a ticket to Tibet, I gotta do some baseball soul-searching! Looks like I have to embrace my inner curveball... 

Agent: What about your TV interview? Or the piece you're going to appear in for that magazine? 

Baba: Cancel 'em! I mean it! Next time I see you, Kiryu-san, I'm gonna be a changed man! Don't you forget it! But I'm not gonna go shaking up my style 'cause of one little loss. If anything, I just have to dive deeper into what I've already got going. Maybe my logic's not all there or whatever, but I'll show you I got the goods! 

Kiryu: Heh, anytime. You bring the most twisted curveball you can throw, and I'll still knock it straight back at you. 

Baba: Yeah right! Later! (runs away)

Agent: Whew. Kazuma Kiryu-san, was it? 

Kiryu: That's me. 

Agent: Allow me to thank you. Baba-san has truthfully been in quite a massive slump lately. I can barely believe just how excited and full of energy he is now. It seems Baba-san really looks up to you. If you ever run into him again, rm sure it would mean a lot if you gave him another run for his money. Please accept this as my thanks. 

You got a Chunk of Wood (Sacred). 

Agent: Now then, I have a swath of angry journalists to call, so if you'll excuse me... 

Kiryu: Sure thing. Tell Baba to take care of himself. 

[Kiryu leaves the Batting Center and finds the building Komeki mentioned.]

Kiryu: (A building in mid-construction... I think the homeless recreation place called the Dragon Palace is in here. Guess I'll check it out...)

Komaki: My favorite disciple has finally returned. It's been quite a while. 

Kiryu: Yeah. Looks like you're doing well as always.  

Komaki: You left Kamurocho without saying goodbye. Again! I had to hear about the whole thing from someone else! 

Kiryu: I apologize. It wasn't the best of times. 

Komaki: Well, I am happy to see you safe. By the way, Kiryu, have you been keeping up with your training? 

Kiryu: Well. I guess I haven't really been training as hard as I should recently... 

Komaki: I thought so. You may be a master of the Komaki Martial Arts, but technique withers without daily practice. Unbelievable... And you haven't even bothered to update your blog with all your revelations! 

Kiryu: Wait, you read my blog!? 

Komaki: Of course I do! What kind of master would I be if I didn't know when my beloved disciple discovers new techniques!? 

Kiryu: I guess... But can you even use the Internet? 

Komaki: My apprentices kept bickering about how they could never get in touch with me. So I had to buy a cell phone. I even used it to text you earlier. 

Kiryu: You don't say... I assumed you had your apprentices do it for you. 

Komaki: I am going out of my way to operate these unfamiliar devices, so the least you could do is update that blog of yours. 

Kiryu: Okay, okay. I'll update it if I see anything else. 

Komaki: Good. I look forward to reading your blog. But enough about that. If you haven't been keeping up with your training, you should practice here. 

Kiryu: Practice? 

Komaki: That's right. What you need most now is not new techniques, but strengthening your basics. I will revive that weakened, untrained body of yours by retraining you with the basics. 

Kiryu: Basics are the foundation of everything, I guess. 

Komaki: Precisely. If you would like to practice here, I'll give you a helping hand. Tell me if you are interested. 

Kiryu: I'll do that. I'll come back to you when I have time. 

Komaki: Good. I'll be waiting. 

Kiryu: (It seems like Master Komaki is looking forward to my blog. I better find some Revelations and update it.) 

[Kiryu leaves his teacher and goes to the Millennium Tower. Many people have gathered around it. Kiryu pushes the onlookers away, making his way to the entrance from which two policemen lead Majima out in handcuffs. Reporters and ordinary citizens are filming what is happening.]

Kiryu: Majima-san… Majima-san!

[He follows Majima who walks slowly with a sad look on his face.]

Majima: Kiryu-chan.

Policeman 1: Hey, don't move!

Policeman 2: That's far enough!

Kiryu: What happened here?

Majima: They trapped me like a freakin' rat. Guess I'm gettin' cropped out for a while.

Kiryu: Who's behind this?

Majima: Daigo.

Kiryu: What!?

Majima: Daigo Dojima.

Kiryu: But why would he...?

Policeman 1: That's enough chit-chat!

Policeman 2: You there, stay back! Unless you want to get hauled in, too!

Majima: Better hurry, Kiryu-chan. It's all one big spider web. The hit back in '85. The ten billion yen. Even Yasuko-chan.

Kiryu: What!?

Majima: If we don't do somethin'... the Tojo's gonna bite the dust. Yasuko-chan's in danger, too. This is on you. You're all we got.

[Majima is put in a police car and taken away.]

Chapter 3: ENCOUNTER
Meanwhile, at the Tojo Clan Chairman’s Office

Chief Munakata: (over phone) So. Majima's been arrested. Great. Yes. They're on the lookout for Yasuko Saejima as we speak. All that remains is tracking down that file. That should be your priority. Very well. Don't disappoint me. Goodbye. (to Daigo) With your invaluable assistance. Majima has been apprehended. That's one fewer obstacle before us. You have my thanks.

[Munakata’s assistant lights his cigarette.]

Chief Munakata: Your decision is the last bit of good news I need. I'm waiting.

[Daigo notices Arai in the room.]

Daigo: This Ueno Seiwa shooting… The ten billion yen back in '05… All of it orchestrated by the police. I can barely believe it.

Chief Munakata: Yet it's the truth. We've come much too far for hesitation Sixth Chairman. If you ask me, Dojima-san… Organized crime is a necessary cog in the machine that is our society. Do you know who rebuilt Japan after World War II? Police and yakuza, in unison. It was a covert affair. The police kept order and protected citizens from the crime that directly affected their lives. Meanwhile, the yakuza preserved Japan's independence by keeping foreign threats out. So I don't claim the police are the only ones on the side of justice. We and the yakuza have always been two sides of the same coin. Always walked this path together. But times change. Yakuza belong buried in the shadows. But you've forgotten your place as you've grown. Crept out into the light of day. All in hopes of making a quick buck. I can't deny that an organization of your size needs the funds. But this is less than ideal for both sides here. I'd like to turn back the clock, restore the natural order of things. Simply say the word, and I'll see to it that the Ueno Seiwa is no more. It'll go through official channels. Clean, orderly. After all, neither you nor i stand to gain from their attempt at a power grab.

Daigo: And your condition is Arai. Am I understanding that right?

Chief Munakata: Precisely. I'd like him promoted to Tojo captain. To act as my liaison within the clan. He'll also assume control of all organizational operations. While you will have fulfilled your duty as chairman to protect your clan. Well? Your Tojo has the chance to finally 'bury the hatchet with a bitter rival. Not a bad deal, I should think.

Daigo: One thing, though. I don't expect the Ueno Seiwa to take this sitting down.

Chief Munakata: If Katsuragi isn't a complete fool, I suspect he'll already be preparing countermeasures. Mostly likely by securing a bargaining chip. A method to sway my colleagues on the force.

Daigo: Like what?

[Meanwhile, a real battle has broken out in the Florist's office. A dozen Yakuza are lying unconscious on the floor. Two of them, still on their feet, are holding Saejima bound in chains. At the Florist's desk stands Katsuragi.]

Katsuragi: Twenty-five years is a long time, huh? Saejima.

Saejima: Katsuragi...

[Katsuragi slowly walks to Saejima.]

Katsuragi: You've definitely aged... but your eyes are as fierce as ever.

Saejima: I don't get it. The hell're you doin' here?

Katsuragi: It's a long, long story. Annoyingly so. But, I'm sure your friend Majima-san already filled you in.

Saejima: So? What's your angle? What do you get outta draggin' me down here!?

Katsuragi: Easy, boy. I'm not planning to put you down just yet. I still need you alive, after all.

Saejima: If you're gonna off me, just get it over with! Dyin' quick beats wasting time with this shit. So just fucking do it!

Katsuragi: My. That's awful brave of you. You've made your peace, then?

Saejima: 'Course I have. I've been on death row. Twenty-five years now. Ever since I offed your men, I been prepared to die.

Katsuragi: (laughs) You killed them, huh?

Saejima: (angerly) What's funny about that!?

Katsuragi: You don't have a clue, do you? No idea what happened back in '85. The only life you ended that day was your own.

Saejima: (shocked) I'm not followin'.

Katsuragi: It was me. I murdered every last one of them. You may think you're some hardened killer… but you're really just a fool.

Saejima: The fuck...? What're you talkin' about, Katsuragi!? Answer me!

Katsuragi: Oh, there's no need to rush. We'll have plenty of time to chat later.

Saejima: What’re you planning!?

Katsuragi: I'm embarrassed to say things have gone somewhat off the rails. At first I was working with the cops. Trying to get my hands on the building that stands above us. But I've had a change of plans. All thanks to a man named Arai.

Saejima: Arai? This Arai... He's Kido's aniki, yeah? The hell's goin' on!?

Katsuragi: You'll know more than enough in good time. But first, I'll need another hand, from you and your sister.

Saejima: What? (rushes forward) The fuck are you gonna do to Yasuko!?

Katsuragi: Whoa, there. Someone's still feeling feisty. Don't worry. You two are key pieces in this chess game. I'm not going to sacrifice you just yet. With you and Yasuko, that file, and more cash than I know what to do with… Munakata is no longer any use to me.

[Someone wearing boots similar to the ones Kiryu wears enters the Florist's office.]

Katsuragi: Well? I trust you've secured the money?

???: Yes. A hundred billion from Sky Finance's secret vault. Every last yen of it, ours.

Saejima: It's you…

Kido: Good seeing you, Saejima-san.

[Saejima is shocked… as we are! Katsuragi smiles.]

====Hurry to New Serena====
Kiryu: (Majima-san said Yasuko-san's in danger… I have a bad feeling about this. Better get back to New Serena and make sure she's okay.)

[He runs to the bar and finds Date on the floor.] 

Kiryu: (What the... Date-san!?) Date-san? Date-san! 

Date: ……Ngh…

Kiryu: (Good. Looks like he's coming to.) Date-san!

Date: Huh? Oh... Kiryu... 

Kiryu: What happened? Are you okay? 

Date: Think so... Guess I just blacked out or something. 

[They sit on the couch.]

Kiryu: You sure you're okay?

Date: My heads still fuzzy as all heck, but yeah. I'll be fine. 

Kiryu: Do you remember what happened? 

Date: Well, you and I had that chat outside, then I came back in to keep Yasuko-san company while you were gone. Next thing I knew I was waking up on the floor to you screaming. 

Kiryu: You don't remember anything else? 

Date: Wait, now that you mention it... Yasuko-san poured us a couple drinks when I stepped back in. 

Kiryu: Drinks? You think there's a chance she drugged you? 

Date: Can't rule out the possibility. They're still on the counter if you wanna have a sip for yourself. 

Kiryu: I think I'll pass. Anyway, do you have any idea where Yasuko-san might have gone?

Date: ...Not a clue, sorry.  

Kiryu: Damnit... 

Date: Look, I'm sorry. I was ready to throw down if some thugs barged in and tried to take her away... but I didn't think Yasuko-san herself would be the one fighting me. 

Kiryu: It's not your fault, Date-san. Guess I should probably get looking for her, though. I'll be back. 

Date: Wait, Kiryu! I'm coming, too! 

Kiryu: No. I need you to stay here in case she comes back. This is probably the safest place in town at this point. 

Date: Right. Well, good luck out there. 

Kiryu: Thanks. I'll be back soon. 

====Find Yasuko====
Kiryu: (No way but forward. Gotta get to Yasuko-san, fast.) 

[He runs around much of the neighborhood looking for a girl who looks like Yasuko.]

Kiryu: (Damnit, looks like I lost her. There!)

[He spots Yasuko and runs after her!]

Kiryu: (Looks like she's headed towards Children's Park. Better go take a look.) 

[Kiryu reaches the park. Yasuko must have jumped into the sewers...]

Kiryu: (Did Yasuko-san really go in here? Only one way to find out...) 

[Meanwhile, Tanimura and Akiyami help Yasuko escape from Kiryu!!!]

Kiryu: (from afar) Wait! I know you're down here!

Tanimura: Dammit. Looks like we got a tail.

Akiyama: C'mon. Let's hide.

[They hide behind the corner.]

Tanimura: Whoever it is, they're close.

Akiyama: Right. Probably another Ueno goon. We're gonna have to make a stand here.

Tanimura: Okay.

[He pulls out a small revolver, most likely Colt Detective. He hands it to Yasuko.]

Tanimura: Yasuko-san, you go on ahead.

Yasuko: Where to?

Akiyama: Just keep going.

Yasuko: Further...?

Akiyama: Yeah. This tunnel will take you all the way down to this seedy old place called Purgatory.

Yasuko: What's that?

Tanimura: You've lived in Kamurocho long enough. I'm sure you've heard the rumors. It's right under West Park. Where all the homeless folks used to hang.

Yasuko: But why there?

Akiyama: Rumor has it, someone who looks like your brother was wandering around there a few days back. One of my old homeless buddies tipped me off.

Tanimura: It's possible he's still there. So leave this tail to us. Just go. And here. In case you need it. Just for an emergency. Okay?

Yasuko: ...Okay.

[He slowly takes the revolver.]

Akiyama: Time to go.

Yasuko: Wait! Akiyama-san, Tanimura-san… Be careful.

Akiyama: Of course.

Tanimura: Catch you later.

[Yasuko runs away. Tanimura and Akiyama face the Dragon of Dojima.]

Kiryu: Who are you?

Tanimura: You with the Ueno Seiwa? Or are you one of Munakata's flunkies?

Kiryu: What are you talking about? What did you do with the girl?

Akiyama: If you mean Lily-chan, that ship has sailed.

Kiryu: What!?

[He rushes forward.]

Akiyama: Whoa, not so fast, pal. Can't let you do that.

Tanimura: You're not laying a finger on Yasuko-san.

Kiryu: I don't think you understand. I'm here to protect her. Not waste time messing with you.

Akiyama: Protect her? Not falling for that. You've got kidnapper written all over you.

Kiryu: I could say the same about you. Now quit stalling and step aside.

Akiyama: Tempting offer Thoughts, Tanimura-san?

Tanimura: He can say whatever he wants. Sorry, but we can't risk trusting a stranger like you. If you're really hellbent on following Yasuko-san...

Kiryu: Then I guess we're done talking here.

Tanimura: That's right.

Kiryu: We'll have time to chat later. You don't look like the bad guys… But I guess there's only one way to settle this.

Akiyama: Good luck with that.

Tanimura: Well? Ready when you are.

Kiryu: If you say so. Let's do this!

[Kiryu blocks both punches! The epic long-awaited hero confrontation begins!!! After a fierce battle to the limit of Tanimura’s and Akiyama’s abilities, Kiryu still manages to win.]

Kiryu: So? No more complaints? I'll be on my way, then.

Tanimura: Damn… Who the hell... was that?

Kiryu: (Need to find Yasuko-san, fast. Someone around here must have seen her.) 

Homeless Man: Whoa, Kiryu-san! Never thought I'd run into ya down here. Didn't even realize you were back in town! 

Kiryu: Do I know you? 

Homeless Man: Heh. Much as you know any old homeless guy, I guess. I know you, though. Owe you a lot, in fact. You helped me out down in Purgatory before the Hills project kicked off, then there was that whole snafu with the Dragon Palace. 

Kiryu: Huh. Well, all right then. 

Homeless Man: By the way, you're gonna need one of these puppies if you wanna keep going. 

You got a Manhole Opener. 

Homeless Man: This doohickey here'll open any ol' manhole you come across. Though some guy came through earlier, pried the freaking thing open with his bare hands. Hardly believed my eyes. 

[Kiryu enters the underground palace in Purgatory and finds a lot of dead men on the floor and a beaten up Florist.]

Kiryu: Florist!

Florist: Kinda late, aren't you? Kiryu.

[Tanimura and Akiyama rush in.]

Akiyama: What in the world...?

Tanimura: Where's Yasuko-san?

Florist: They nabbed her.

Akiyama: Who's “they”?

Florist: Katsuragi. Him… and some punk named Kido.

[Akiyama is not even shocked.]

Tanimura: Dammit. The hell's going on here?

[Only Kiryu stands silent and thinks.]

Chapter 4: CHAIN OF BETRAYAL
[New Serena. Date treats Tanimura's abrasions.]

Tanimura: Ow!

Date: Sit still! Detectives these days. Bunch of damn babies.

Tanimura: Gotta say, I'm still kinda mindblown. Running into a police legend in a place like this. Prolly the biggest surprise I've gotten all week.

Date: Cut it out. Or is there something wrong with an ex-cop writing articles and tending bars?

Tanimura: Didn't say that. But, now I think about it... the past few days have been one trip after another.

Date: Oh, there they are.

[Kiryu and Akiyama enter.]

Date: Well? How's the office looking?

Akiyama: Tragic. Place was completely trashed. (lays down on the counter) Man… Took me years to scrape all that cash together. Now look at me. Back at square one.

Date: So they cleaned you out, then?

Akiyama: Oh yes. Every last yen.

Date: How much are we talking?

Akiyama: 'Bout a hundred bil.

{It is about $880 million dollars.}

Date: A hundred billion!? Is he for real?

Kiryu: Yeah. I didn't believe it myself at first, but apparently he's telling the truth.

Tanimura: Mind explaining, Akiyama-san?

Akiyama: Oh, sure. I've got a big vault hidden in my office. Keep all my cash stashed in there. Guess they figured out where it was.

Tanimura: Who?

Akiyama: Maybe the DA? More like Kido-chan, probably.

Tanimura: Wait. This Kido... You mean Arai's right-hand man?

Nine days earlier, at Sky Finance…

[Kido enters Akiyama’s office. It’s clean and tidy.]

Kido: Heyo. Hm? Nobody home?

[Kido sits on the couch and lights a cigarette. After a minute he starts wandering around touching stuff.]

Kido: The legal codes, huh? Akiyama-san's always been the smart one.

[He sees a button under the book…]

Kido: The heck is this?

[He pushes it and the bookcase slides on the side. Books fall off the shelves.]

Kido: Whoa, what the!? Shit! What'd I do!?

[There’s a vault behind the bookcase. Kido opens the massive door (it’s not even have a simple lock) and enters the vault. There’s money. MONEY. EVERYWHERE. The pile is enormous in comparison to the pile from Yakuza Kiwami which flew all over the city after the explosion.]

Kido: Holy… 

[He runs outta the vault and sees Hana-can with 2 bags walks towards the office.]

Kido: Fuck!

[He quickly tries to clean everything up and close the vault.]

Kido: C'mon, c'mon!

Hana: (behind the door) I'm back! Huh? How many times do I have to tell him to lock up when he leaves? Kido-san, sorry to keep you waiting! I was just grabbing a few things.

[Kido pretends to just be looking at some book.]

Kido: Oh, no problem at all. The door was unlocked, so...

[Back to the New Serena…]

Date: You really think that's how it went down?

Akiyama: Can't think of any other way. Me and Hana-chan are the only two people who knew about the vault. Kido-chan's the only other possibility. 

Kiryu: What makes you say that? 

Akiyama: Well, it would certainly wrap things up all nice and neat. Everything would make sense. 

Kiryu: What do you mean? 

Akiyama: Not long after Hana-chan saw him at the office, Kido-chan got hauled off by Hatsushiba Clan boys, who'd been working with the Shibata. Just walked in and spirited him away. Simple. Clean.  

Kiryu: What's so strange about that? 

Akiyama: Everything. You'd understand if you've seen what Kido-chan can do in a fight. 

Date: Go on. 

Akiyama: Well, it's only been once I've witnessed it myself, but the guy can mop the floor with anyone without even breaking a sweat. He's pretty coy about it, though. Prefers to keep all that under wraps. 

Date: How come? 

Kiryu: It’s better for the family that way. 

Akiyama: Most likely. Kanemura Enterprises, where Kido-chan and Arai-san work, is a tiny speck under the big Shibata umbrella. Now your usual yakuza outfit makes their living off those dramatic displays of strength... but not Kanemura. 

Date: Why not? 

Akiyama: Didn't wanna stand out, especially with the rat race always tearing this town apart. Guess that's just how he was. 

Tanimura: Makes sense. It's safer to lay low and just get on with your life than to start bashing heads in. 

Akiyama: Yup. Kanemura couldn't even afford his dues to the Shibata. Came to me begging for a loan and everything. Expanding his turf and inviting competition was probably the last thing on his mind.

Kiryu: I’m sure he was more than happy to keep his head down and let Kamurocho be Kamurocho. 

Akiyama: For sure. That's why Arai-san and Kido-chan were so careful not to make any waves. But yeah. Kido-chan's a monster. 

Date: You think he let himself get kidnapped on purpose, then? 

Akiyama: You bet I do. By the time I got back to the office that day, he was already gone. The place was more of a mess than usual thanks to the “struggle.” It was convincing, honestly. But one thing stood out to me.

Tanimura: Which was what? 

Akiyama: The order my books were in. 

Tanimura: Your... books? 

Akiyama: Yup. Kido-chan tossed a bunch of them around, probably to make it look like a fight went down. Cover his tracks, you know. But the ones that were still on the shelf weren't in the right spots for some reason. That's how I knew something was up. 

Tanimura: Hold on. Your office isn't exactly what I'd call organized. Not by a long shot. Are you seriously telling me you know where every single book is supposed to be on your shelf? 

Akiyama: Every single one. 

Tanimura: Whoa... 

Akiyama: Long story short, my old pal Kido-chan pulled a fast one on me.

Date: What I really wanna know is, who keeps a hundred billion in cash just lying around in this day and age? Why not stash it in a bank? 

Akiyama: Don't trust 'em. Besides, it's not like any of them pay decent interest anyway. 

Kiryu: That much physical money isn't exactly portable, though. How did they get it all out?

Akiyama: Ask the “DA” guys who raided my office yesterday. They’re the ones who did it. 

Tanimura: You think they were impostors? 

Akiyama: Big time. Katsuragi must've sent them over once Kido-chan tipped him off. 

Kiryu: That would explain it. 

Akiyama: (scratches his head) Life's a cruel mistress sometimes. Sure, you get used to the cheating and the backstabbing and the lying in my line of work. But when it all smacks you in the face one after another… Oof.  

Date: You seem like you're taking it pretty well, though. Most guys would go into total shock if they lost a hundred grand, let alone a hundred billion. 

Akiyama: I am in shock. This is me in shock. It's not that big of a deal, I know, but still. 

Date: Not that big of a deal!? 

Akiyama: I'll just make it all back again. 

Date: But…

Tanimura: ……

Kiryu: Heh.

Akiyama: And hey, the week has had its highlights. 

Kiryu: Oh yeah?

Akiyama: I met you for one, Kiryu-san. 

Kiryu: Is that really so special? 

Akiyama: You're my freaking hero, man. You saved my life. 

Kiryu: Did I? I think I'd remember that. 

Akiyama: Just listen. You know when the Millennium Tower blew up five years ago? When all that cash rained down on the city? That day... changed my life. I grabbed as much as I could. Cleaned myself up. Went from homeless bum to this in practically no time flat. If not for you, I'd still be out on the streets. Digging through trash just to keep myself alive. 

Kiryu: That's the money you built your business on, huh? 

Akiyama: Yup. Though now that I think about it... That ten billion was probably the same cash my bank duped me into laundering for them before they had me take the fall. 

Kiryu: The ten billion Jingu diverted to the Tojo Clan. 

Akiyama: …So, yeah. This all feels kinda personal somehow. If this stuff going down now is linked to that ten billion, consider me there. (lights a cigarette) I dunno about you guys, but this is starting to feel like fate to me. Almost like we were all destined to end up here.

Tanimura: Fate? 

Date: Hm.

Kiryu: You might just be right... 

Date: So, what comes next? You getting Saejima and Yasuko back?

Kiryu: Of course. That's a given.

Tanimura: The real question is, how? Katsuragi already has his hands on the cash. We need to figure out where he is. Hit him and his boys head on.

Kiryu: No, I have a plan.

[He pulls out Hamazaki’s folder. He opens it on the very page where you can see the transaction of 10 billion.]

Akiyama: What the...

Date: Hold on, Kiryu. What am I looking at?

Kiryu: It's our smoking gun. Leverage.No doubt, Munakata and Katsuragi are both clamoring for this file right now. With a little push... we'll be able to draw them out.

Date: How'd you end up with this thing, Kiryu? 

Kiryu: Hamazaki gave it to me down in Okinawa. It's a document showing the creation of Penitentiary No. 2, and the expected flow of money into the place. 

Akiyama: Huh, will you look at that. It's got names, amounts, everything. 

Kiryu: Yeah. It says right here that the ten billion yen that got transferred from the Tojo to Kyohei Jingu back in 2005 was meant to get passed on to the Metropolitan Police. 

Tanimura: That's the incident you were wrapped up in, right, Kiryu-san? 

Kiryu: Right. That missing cash nearly tore the clan apart. And the guy behind it all was a man named Kyohei Jingu. Haruka's father. But there's more. There are notes on here detailing a police plan to release inmates from Penitentiary No. 2 and create artificial crime. All to make the police look good. 

Date: That's one hell of a scoop. 

Tanimura: No wonder they're so desperate to get it back. This goes public. all their dirty laundry'll be out in the open.

Date: So what's your next move? 

Kiryu: We try and cut a deal with Katsuragi. I just need to figure out how to get in touch with him. 

Tanimura: I can help you with that. He and I have talked on the phone before. If you call from my cell, I'm sure he'll answer. 

Kiryu: Huh. Mind if I borrow your phone, then? 

Tanimura: Go right ahead. 

[Kiryu calls Katsuragi.]

Katsuragi: ……

Kiryu: You there, Katsuragi? 

Katsuragi: You're not Tanimura. 

Kiryu: My name's Kiryu. I needed to talk to you, so I'm borrowing Tanimura's phone for a bit. 

Katsuragi: Kiryu? As in the Tojo Clan fourth chairman, Kazuma Kiryu-san?

Kiryu: That's the one. 

Katsuragi: Well, well, well. What a nice little surprise. So, what can I do for you? 

Kiryu: I'm calling about Taiga and Yasuko Saejima. 

Katsuragi: Oh? I don't know what you're talking about. 

Kiryu: Drop the act. We know you took them from Purgatory. 

Katsuragi: And what of it? 

Kiryu: I want to cut a deal with you. I have something you want very badly. I'm sure of it. 

Katsuragi: ……

Kiryu: The file Hamazaki stole from Penitentiary No. 2 when he and Saejima broke out. I can't help but assume you want it back. But maybe I'm wrong. 

Katsuragi: ……

Kiryu: Sounds like you don't want it after all. Let's just forget this ever happened. Later. 

Katsuragi: Wait.

Kiryu:  ……

Katsuragi: How did that file find its way into your hands? 

Kiryu: Good question. Hamazaki gave it to me down in Okinawa. 

Katsuragi: ...And who knows about all this? 

Kiryu: Besides me and Hamazaki, just a few others who are here with me now. 

Katsuragi: Munakata is in the dark? 

Kiryu: Munakata? 

Katsuragi: Deputy commissioner of the Tokyo PD. 

Kiryu: Yeah. I don't see how he'd know. 

Katsuragi: ...Good. Well? Let's hear what you want. 

Kiryu: Taiga and Yasuko Saejima back safely. And the money Kido stole from Sky Finance. Should be around a hundred billion. 

Katsuragi: For a living yakuza legend, you make a piss poor negotiator. You're going to have to do better than that. 

Kiryu: ……

Katsuragi: Negotiation is a psychological battle. If you can't entice the other party with terms that favor them, you may as well pack up and go home. You understand, don't you?

Kiryu: ...Then what do you suggest? 

Katsuragi: What indeed... How about this? You come alone to make the exchange. 

Kiryu: Alone?

Katsuragi: You heard me. I'd like to see you bloodied and bruised by the time you arrive, as well. 

Kiryu: What's that supposed to mean? 

Katsuragi: I'm going to have you jump through a little hoop for me. See if this old dog can still do a few tricks. 

Kiryu: What?

Katsuragi: We'll make the exchange on the Kamurocho Hills roof. I'll be waiting there with Saejima, his sister, and the hundred billion yen. All you'll need to do to reach the roof... is fight your way through the entire Ueno Seiwa Clan. 

Kiryu: What!?

Katsuragi: (soft laugh) You might make your way up to the roof. You might die in the process. It doesn't matter much to me either way. Those are the terms I'd be willing to accept. 

Kiryu: And if I make it up to the roof? 

Katsuragi: Then we move forward with the transaction. And I'll be secure in the knowledge that you'll be far too exhausted to kill me. Even if you wanted to.

Kiryu: ……

Katsuragi: This is just how it has to be, Kiryu-san. I plan to live a long, fulfilling life. And taking my chances with monsters like you and Saejima... Well, it would be nothing short of a fool's errand. Not all yakuza are like Nishikiyama or Ryuji Goda. Some of us would rather survive than die atop the hill of “honor” and “manliness.” So, do we have a deal?

Kiryu: Fine. I'll be there, just name the time. 

Katsuragi: Ten o'clock tonight. (smirks) I can only hope you still have a pulse by the time I see you next. Until then.

[He hangs up.]

Date: What's the deal, Kiryu? Sounded like you came to some kind of agreement? 

Kiryu: Yeah, I'm meeting him with the file on the roof of Kamurocho Hills. Tonight at ten... alone.

Tanimura: Alone!? But that's insane!  

Date: You're not actually going through with that baloney, are you?

Kiryu: I have to. That's part of the deal. Sounds like I'll be fighting through the entire Ueno Seiwa Clan to get up there, too. 

Akiyama: Guy doesn't take any chances once he gets down to business. huh? You sure you still wanna go? 

Kiryu: I'm sure. There's no other way. 

Date: You say that, but... 

Akiyama: Let him go if he wants to go. Besides, I don't think anything we say is gonna change his mind. Isn't that right, Kiryu-san? 

Kiryu: Right. A deal's a deal. Well, I should probably get going. 

Date: Be careful out there, Kiryu. 

Kiryu: I will.

====Head to Kamurocho Hills====
[Kiryu leaves the bar and gets a call.]

The Florist: Kiryu. You on your way to Kamurocho Hills? 

Kiryu: Why am I not surprised that you know that? 

The Florist: Haha, it's all part of the job! Anyway, I know you already know this... But you can get to Kamurocho Hills via the bathroom in West Park. Doubt you'll forget that anytime soon. 

Kiryu: Yeah. Thanks, Florist. 

[He runs to the West Park and enters the former Purgatory that is called Kamurocho Hills nowadays. He gets a nice and cozy yakuza welcome.]

====Head to the Roof====
[After defeating a bunch of Ueno Seiwa thighs, Kiryu approaches the entrance to the building.]

Kiryu: (Looks like I'm gonna have to go through the front...) 

[He fights his way floor after floor to the roof.]

You got the Key to Kamurocho Hills. 

Kiryu: (Great, the key to the emergency exit. Time to keep moving. ) 

[He defeats a bunch of strong thighs on the emergency exit.]

Kiryu: (Better hurry to the roof.) 

[Kiryu runs towards the rooftop. Despite his many battles, he still has a lot of strength. He sees Yasuko and Taiga tied up on the floor.]

Kiryu: Katsuragi!

Katsuragi: I'm impressed you made it up here. I suppose not all legends are mere fiction.

Kiryu: Enough games. Let's finish this.

Katsuragi: Fine by me. I'm a man of my word, after all. 

[Above them are the characters 真島組 which mean Majima Group. There are also two characters 全 and 第 which mean "top floor".]

Katsuragi: What I lack in brawn, I make up for with honor.

Kiryu: Here's the file you want. Now let those two go. And hand over the hundred billion!

Katsuragi: Relax, relax. A mountain of cash that big isn't the easiest thing to move around.

[The sound of a cargo elevator is heard.]

Katsuragi: Sounds like it's just arriving now. 

[An elevator with hundreds of suitcases full of money arrives on the roof. And with them... Kido.]

Kido: Sorry for the wait. Here's the cash, as promised. All one hundred bil.

[Saejima yells at him in a rage through the bandage over his mouth.]

Kiryu: So, you're Kido.

Kido: And you must be Kazuma Kiryu. It's an honor to meet you. Truly.

Katsuragi: Now that introductions are out of the way, let's get down to business.

Kiryu: Fine.

Katsuragi: We'll do this one step at a time.

[Kido unties Yasuko and helps her get up.]

Katsuragi: First, Yasuko Saejima. Don't take a single step from that spot. When Kido comes to you, he'll hand over the girl and you'll give him the file. Once I've confirmed its contents, we'll leave you here with Saejima and the money. And that'll be it.

Kiryu: All right.

Katsuragi: (smirks) Impressive resolve. Not a sliver of doubt, even at a time like this. Fine, then. Go.

[Kido walks with Yasuko towards Kiryu. Bringing her to Kiryu, he peels the plaster from her mouth.]

Kido: Sorry about all this. (to Kiryu) The file.

[Kiryu hesitates but hands Kido the folder.]

Kiryu: (to Yasuko) Are you okay?

Yasuko: I'm sorry. I should've listened to you.

Kiryu: What's done is done. Did you talk to your brother?

Yasuko: Yes. We had plenty of time while we were locked up together.

Kiryu: Glad to hear it.

[Turning to Katsuragi, Kido pulls out a gun... Saejima tries to scream. Kido points his gun at Kiryu and Yasuko.]

Katsuragi: (laughs) You're bigger fools than I realized! Did you really believe I'd let you walk out of here alive?

Kiryu: Katsuragi!

Katsuragi: Kido... Do it!

[Kido takes aim... and then turns around and shoots Katsuragi in the chest. Katsuragi looks at him with an incomprehensible look. Kido shoots a few more times.]

Katsuragi: Why…?

[Kido throws the gun. ]

Kido: Watch close.

[He walks over to the suitcases with the money and presses the elevator button. The elevator goes down. Arai stands behind it.]

Katsuragi: You!

Yasuko: It's him... Arai.

Kiryu: Arai!?

Kido: (walks to Arai) Katsuragi-san. You should've known I'm not the kinda guy to stab his aniki in the back. Aniki. Here it is.

[He hands the folder to Arai.]

Arai: I knew I could count on you. Nicely done, Kido.

Kido: Thanks!

[In gratitude, Arai shoots Kido. He falls on the roof of the elevator.]

Kido: Ani… ki?

[Arai goes to the elevator control panel and presses a button. The elevator with the dying Kido on it goes down.]

Kido: Aniki… You…

Kiryu: How could you?

Arai: Kazuma Kiryu-san, yes? I'm the captain of Kanemura Enterprises, under the Tojo's Shibata Family. The name's Arai. I'm honored to finally meet you face-to-face.

Kiryu: Don't talk to me about honor. Do you have any idea what you just did? There's nothing more disgraceful than betraying a sworn brother. You understand me!?

Arai: I do, in fact. Better than you realize. (walks away)

Kiryu: Listen, Arai! The Tojo Clan will never be yours. I'll see to that myself. No matter what it takes. Hear me?

Arai: You're too late. You're always too late. That's why these things happen. Bye now.

Yasuko: Taiga!

[She peels the plaster from his mouth.]

Saejima: Yasuko, hurry! The bastard's still breathin'! Katsuragi!

[He runs to Katsuragi's body and rips the shirt off his chest. Underneath it is... a bulletproof vest.]

Katsuragi: Good for you. You're not the same dumb ox you were twenty-five years ago.

Saejima: What was that?

Katsuragi: But in the end… you didn't snuff out a single life that day. A total failure of a hitman. I feel sorry for that fool Sasai. Footing the bill on a halfwit like you.

[Saejima screams in rage and swings for a punch, but only hits the metal floor.]

Saejima: Not today. Scum low as you ain't even worth killin'. You can lie there till ya rot.

[Katsuragi smiles and slowly reaches for his hidden gun. He shoots Saejima in the arm.]

Yasuko: Taiga!

Saejima: You... fuckin' coward!

[Saejima turns to Katsuragi. Katsuragi shoots a second time. Yasuko covers him with her body so fast that Saejima doesn't even have time to react. The bullet hits Yasuko in the back.]

Saejima: Yasuko? Hey, Yasuko? Yasuko!

Yasuko: Give me... a minute.

[She walks towards Katsuragi.]

Saejima: Yasuko? Wait. What're ya doin'? Answer me!

Katsuragi: (shocked) I... I don't get it. Get back… Get back!

[He, crying, tries to shoot several times. There are only a few cartridges in his small gun. He misses every one of them. Yasuko slowly retrieves the Colt Detective that Tanimura gave her.]

Katsuragi: What are you doing... with that?

Yasuko: Tanimura-san gave it to me. This gun… Is going to avenge his father's death. I owe him that much at least

Saejima: Wait! Ya can't do this!

Yasuko: Stay back. Thank you, Taiga. It may have just been today… But I'm glad I got to see you one last time.

Saejima: Yasuko.

Yasuko: You're an innocent man, Taiga. But me… I already have so much blood on my hands. That's why... it has to be me.

Katsuragi: (whining) N-No! You can't!

Yasuko: This is the only way... I can repay you for all you've done. Forgive me.

[She shoots Katsuragi in the head and falls on the metal floor.]

Saejima: Yasuko! Hey, Yasuko? Yasuko!? Say somethin', please! 

Yasuko: I’m… sorry. Tai… ga… (dies)

Saejima: Hey! Yasuko? Yasuko! Wake up! (screams his heart out)

[PART 4 COMPLETE]

FINALE: REQUIEM
[Chief Munakata sits in his office. In front of him lies a folder worth many people's lives.]

Chief Minakata: Excuse me? You didn't finish the job? That's not like you in the slightest.

Arai: I have no excuse, sir. 

Chief Minakata:I take it you let your feelings get the better of you? No matter. Letting a simple brat like Kido live won't make any difference in the end. And thanks to Kazuma Kiryu's dismantling of the Ueno Seiwa… Our only issue now is the money.

Arai: The money, sir?

Chief Minakata: Correct. You returned this file safe and sound. But I wonder. Why didn't you bring the hundred billion back as well? It would have been a simple enough task, specially with my men on the force assisting you. And yet you did nothing.

Arai: You never instructed me as such, Deputy Commissioner.

[Chief Munakata abruptly throws the folder on his coffee table.]

Chief Minakata: That won’t do. Listen. You're supposed to be helping me bring about a new underground empire, letting a mountain of untraceable cash slip away... Such an amateur mistake is simply unacceptable. Use your head. We have nowhere near the funds we require. Surely that much is apparent even to you.

Arai: Yes, sir.

Chief Minakata: (pats Arai’s shoulder) Good. I have to ask. Where is the money now?

Arai: In the hands of Kazuma Kiryu and his associates.

Chief Minakata: I see… Then it'll be your responsibility to retrieve it all from them.

Arai: How, sir?

Chief Minakata: We negotiate. Even the toughest men have their weaknesses.

[He shows Arai a few photos of the children at Morning Glory Orphanage.]

Chief Minakata: Take these children from their home in Okinawa. With their lives on the line, Kiryu will surely come to the table. 

[He puts a gun on the photos.]

Chief Minakata: Why the silence, Arai-kun? I thought this order simple enough even for you.

Arai: It is, sir.

Chief Minakata: I don't expect you'll need it, but take this in case anyone gives you trouble. It's nigh untraceable.

[Arai takes the gun.]

Chief Minakata: Good boy.

Arai: Deputy Commissioner?

[He points the gun at Munakata.]

Chief Minakata: What are you...?

Arai: This is the end. I'm done following orders.

Chief Minakata: Arai.

Arai: As a yakuza… No. As an officer of the law, there's a code I need to uphold.

[He shoots Munakata point blank. We returns to New Serena.]

Date: Where's Akiyama? 

Tanimura: Over at his office. Said he needed some time alone. Can't say I blame him. Not with how he felt about Yasuko-san. 

Date: Yeah... I can't imagine. Anyway, what now? Munakata has probably had his paws on that file for a while at this point.

Kiryu: Good question. 

Tanimura: (looks at Saejima) Well, we can't let things end like this, that's for sure. Yasuko-san's dead. Munakata's still on the force. And nobody's doing a damn thing about it! You think I'm just gonna sit around and let that stand!? 

Date: ……Tanimura... 

[Saejima stands up and walks towards the exit.]

Kiryu: Where are you going? 

Saejima: Don't gotta tell you that. 

Kiryu: Saejima. We have proof now that you didn't commit those murders twenty-five years ago. You'll be a free man once we get them to review your case. 

Saejima: Don't give a rat's ass one way or the other. Do whatever ya wanna do. ...I ain't goin' nowhere. Just gonna go get some fresh air. (leaves)

[Kiryu’s phone rings.]

Haruka: Uncle Kaz.

Kiryu: Haruka. What’s wrong? Did something happen? 

Haruka: Uncle Kaz. Hamazaki-san, he... 

Kiryu: Hamazaki? What happened to him? 

Haruka: He's... He's gone. He just passed away in the hospital. 

Kiryu: What!?

Haruka: According to the doctor, the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back. 

Kiryu: ……

Haruka: ……

Kiryu: All right, I understand. Thanks for being there in his final moments, Haruka. 

Haruka: You don't have to thank me for that. And hey... Uncle Kaz? 

Kiryu: Hm? What is it? 

Haruka: Hamazaki-san died protecting you, didn't he? 

Kiryu: ...Yeah, it seems like it. He sacrificed his life for us. 

Haruka: Then... I wish I could tell him how sorry I am. I was so wrong about him. 

Kiryu: It’s okay, Haruka. 

Haruka: When Hamazaki-san was on his deathbed... he asked me to tell you something. “Keep the Tojo Clan safe from the cops. It's the only proof left that guys like us ever existed.”

Kiryu: ……

Haruka: He wanted you to tell Saejima-san, too. That was his dying wish. 

Kiryu: Got it. Thanks for telling me all this, Haruka. 

Haruka: Of course.

Kiryu: By the way. What happened to Hamazaki's body? 

Haruka: I had them send it back to Morning Glory. Is that okay? 

Kiryu: Yeah, that's perfect. Sorry you had to go through all this. 

Haruka: It's okay. I'll be fine.

Kiryu: I should be back in Okinawa soon. And once I am, we'll make sure he gets a proper burial.  

Haruka: Okay.

Kiryu: Talk to you soon. 

[The scene changes to Sky Finance. Akiyama looks at his billions then suddenly someone walks to the door of his office. We switch to Kiryu who finds Saejima on the roof of the building.]

Kiryu: Saejima.

Saejima:  I'm not lookin' for revenge. Don't give a flip about huntin' down some dirty cops, either.

Kiryu: I just got a call from Haruka. Hamazaki's gone. Passed away in the hospital.

Saejima: What?

Kiryu: From what I can tell... he took a bullet to protect me and Yasuko-san down in Okinawa. He'd been in intensive care ever since. He was at peace in his last moments, though. That's not all Haruka told me. Hamazaki left a message for you before he went. "Keep the Tojo Clan safe from the cops. It's the only proof left that guys like us ever existed."

Saejima: Hamazaki…

Kiryu: It took me forty years to realize this. But for guys like us... our lives aren't really our own. There's always someone new to help. Someone we need to protect. These past few years, I fought that fate with all I had. But I'm done fighting. It's time I accept the hand I was dealt.

Saejima: Kiryu.

Kiryu: We have to do this, Saejima. Too many people depend on us. Their dreams depend on us.

[Tanimura and Akiyama join them.]

Tanimura: He's right. There's still plenty of work to do.

Akiyama: You ask me, a tiger belongs in his jungle. And besides, I think all four of us have some unfinished business.

[They go back to New Serena.]

Akiyama: I've got an idea. Lees use my hundred bil. 

Date: ...How, exactly? 

Akiyama: It’s simple. We haul it up to the roof of the Millennium Tower, then kick back and wait. 

Tanimura: What, that's it? 

Akiyama: That's it. 

Date: Back it up a sec. What's that accomplish? 

Akiyama: It'll bring all the flies buzzing straight into our web. 

Kiryu: Flies? 

Akiyama: Not literally. I'm talking about our enemies. 

Tanimura: That's kind of a broad term. Who exactly are you thinking is gonna show? 

Akiyama: Not sure. Well just have to wait and find out. 

Date: ...Huh? You're not making any sense, man.

Akiyama: Just hold on a second. Think about everyone we know who's wrapped up in all this. Munakata, Arai-san, Kido-chan, the Tojo. All those parties are playing different roles in this little performance... but we still don't know who's the real ringleader. Until we get them all in one place, laying it all on the line... we're just gonna be shooting in the dark.

Kiryu: So we'll lure them out to find out who's really in charge.

Akiyama: Exactly. We tell each party that we're keeping the cash on the roof of the Millennium Tower... and they can come up and make a deal with us if they want a slice of the pie. We play our cards right, they all slam headfirst into each other.

Tanimura: And then they'll duke it out over the money.

Akiyama: Yup. Though I don't really care if they fight or not. All that matters is that we figure out who the big bad is. From then on it'll just be a good old-fashioned beatdown.

Kiryu: That's my kind of plan.

Tanimura: That's the what and where settled, then. What about the when?

Akiyama: Well, it's gonna take a while to haul all those stacks up there. And I'm sure all of you have stuff you wanna handle before we execute the plan. How about we go our separate ways for a while, grab some food, hit up a few convenience stores, then meet back here when we're ready?

Tanimura: Works for me.

Kiryu: Sounds like a plan.

Tanimura: You good with that, Saejima-san?

Saejima: (doesn’t paying any attention to the others) ...Yeah. I'm in.

Akiyama: Great. Everyone go do their own thing, and we'll reconvene here.

[He holds out his arm.]

Tanimura: Can we not? The whole "go team" thing is corny.

Akiyama: Oh, get over yourself. This is important! Now gimme those hands.

Kiryu: (smiles)

Akiyama: Yeah, whatever.

[They put the palm of their hand on the palm as a sign of unity of effort. However, someone's palm is clearly missing...]

Tanimura: Saejima-san?

Akiyama: I know I made it sound simple… But one misstep and we're all breathing our last. Everyone gets that, yeah?

[Saejima puts his palm on top of the others. Everyone smiles.]

Akiyama: Well then.

Date: Let me know when you guys are ready to go to the Millennium Tower. Well head out once all four of you are good. Oh, and I brought some blankets so you can rest. Can’t take down a massive criminal conspiracy without a little beauty sleep, right? 

You can switch between day and night by resting. 

[Kiryu decides to talk to the team before they go.]

Tanimura: Oh, Kiryu-san. I’d be glad to head out for you if there's something you need taken care of. 

Kiryu: No, it’s okay. 

Tanimura: Oh, all right. Just try to take care of yourself, okay? 

Akiyama: By the way, are you strapped for cash at all? We're already in pretty deep, so feel free to use my money. 

When you are able to swap between main characters, your money, points accumulated from the Casino and Coliseum, as well as items stored in the Item Box will all be consolidated. Also, places that only certain main characters could enter may now be accessible by others. Try exploring Kamurocho with each of the four main characters. 

Akiyama: Well, the money from my place is gonna be sitting pretty on the roof of the Millennium Tower, so I can't let you have any of that. It'll be from my own personal account. 

Saejima: Oh, Kiryu. Why don't ya take a load off for a bit? Be glad to run some errands if ya need a hand.

Kiryu: No, it’s okay.  

Saejima: If ya say so. 

Date: So these are the final hours before the big showdown, huh? Make sure you're prepared before you go. And talk to the others before you rest. 

During the Finale, you can switch between any of the four main characters at New Serena. Talk to the character you want to control and select the appropriate command. 

Date: I have no idea what's in store for you guys... All I can say is, make sure you don't have any regrets before you head out. Hey, you guys ready to go? 

Kiryu: Yeah, let's roll. 

Date: You're really sure? You might wanna stock up on Staminans if you haven't already. This'll be your last chance. 

Kiryu: Yeah, we're good to go. 

Date: Then let’s do it. 

[The roof. Four guys - Kiryu, Akiyama, Tanimura and Saejima -  in strict business suits pray upon a photo of young Yasuko. They leave one by one and then epically walks down the street to Millenium Tower.]

Akiyama: So, who do you think's gonna show?

Saejima: Don't matter to me. Might be Munakata. Might be Arai. I'm not lettin' anyone fuck with the Tojo Clan.

Kiryu: Well, let's get moving.

[Meanwhile, at the very top of the Tower, on the helipad, Akiyama's money is already beautifully stacked in the form of a pyramid and not a single yen is flying away from the strong flow of the wind. Unexpectedly, Daigo and Arai appear on either side of the pyramid.]

Arai: You wasted no time in getting here… Chairman Dojima>

Daigo: Arai.

Arai: I knew you'd come. After all, you're the one who's been engineering Kido's every move. Isn't that right, Kido!?

[Kido shockingly appears from behind the pyramid.]

Kido: Forgive me, Aniki.

Daigo: How long have you known?

Arai: Since Kido told me about the 100 billion. He wanted to steal Akiyama-san's money, pretend to turn it over to Katsuragi… Then invest in Munakata's master plan. Or so he claimed. Kido is my trusted sworn brother. But he couldn't possibly have known of my link to Munakata. Someone else must have filled him in on the details. And that, Daigo-san… Must have been you.

Daigo: Fair enough.

Arai: You nudged Kido closer to Katsuragi. Had him squeal about the 100 billion. Katsuragi, desperate after Munakata abandoned him, was all too easy to manipulate into slipping up. And that slip up indeed came... when the Ueno Seiwa fell by Kiryu-san's hand. Without even the slightest support from Munakata. But something derailed your plan. The death of Yasuko Saejima. If she had only survived, everything would have gone off without a hitch. After all, with no reason left to fight, Kiryu and Saejima would have left Kamurocho.

Daigo: Impressive. You figured all that out?

Arai: Not without some help from Kido here. He confirmed my suspicions. I knew if I let him live, he'd end up running straight into your arms. So, when was it? When did you decide to betray the Tojo to get at this money?

Daigo: Betrayal, you say?

Arai: But of course. There's no other word for it. You've spat on Kiryu-san and Kazama-san's legacy d everyone else who had made the Tojo Clan great. You even served Majima-san to Munakata on a silver platter. All that for this pile of cash?

Daigo: You don't know a damn thing! The clan isn't what it used to be. We have over 100 families. 30,000 men. Do you know what it takes to keep order in that chaos!?

Arai: Chairman...

Daigo: We’ve always had heroes like Kiryu-san to protect us. That's how the Tojo has lasted so long. But we've reached our limit. I have to rebuild from the ground up, even if that means making sacrifices along the way!

Arai: Sacrifices like throwing Majima, to the police department wolves!? This is all wrong, Daigo-san!

Daigo: It's for the good of the clan! If don't keep it safe, who will!? You don't have what it takes, Arai! Besides, you're not going about this any better than me. You talk like you're the perfect yakuza, but you're just another police whipping boy!

Arai: Touché. But I'm no whipping boy.

[He takes his police badge out of his pocket and throws it at Daigo's feet. Kido shocked.]

Kido: What the!?

Daigo: Hold on. That would mean...

Arai: Yes. I'm not yakuza. Never have been. I'm an undercover agent sent by Munakata to investigate the Tojo. And to seize control of the clan.

Kido: Aniki, you're a cop?

Arai: I was. But that too is in the past! I betrayed Munakata. Ended his life! You see, Daigo-san? I'm not like you at all! I'll bring my justice to the world, even if I have to fight fate itself! And this money'll help me do it!

[There’s yet another crushing appearance!]

Chief Munakata: Fool. Through the millennia of human history, one truth has been made clear. There's no overcoming your station in life. 

[The helipad is surrounded by special forces.]

Chief Munakata: Power has always reigned supreme. Some use, while all others become the used.

Arai: Deputy Commissioner? How are you still alive?

[Munakata shoots his negligent subordinate!]

Chief Munakata: Painful, yes? But it's far from lethal. A truly amazing technology. Vastly improved in the past 25 years.

Daigo: Explain.

Chief Munakata: These are non-lethal riot control rounds. Highly advanced rubber bullets. 

Arai: Then the rounds in the gun I shot you with...

Chief Munakata: Never had a chance of finishing the job. (laugh) Your lack of finesse is what holds you back, Arai-kun. Justice is far beyond your reach. Oh, and Dojima-san. The same goes for you. Keeping the Tojo Clan afloat must be difficult for a man of your inferior caliber. And you. Stumbling across that 100 billion must have felt like a dream come true. Not that dreams are a bad thing. I can forgive you for that, at least.

Daigo: Munakata...

Chief Munakata: The men before you are my loyal servants. You all die here today. I won't let anyone get in the way of my grand ideals.

[He waves his hand. Special Forces take aim at Daigo, Kido and Arai. It's funny that they're still holding Colt Detective revolvers. Suddenly a helicopter appears. As he lands, he scatters the pyramid of money.]

Chief Munakata: The money! Don't just stand there, you fools! Do something!

[Special Forces shoot the helicopter with almost useless revolvers.]

Chief Munakata: What are you doing? Shoot that thing down!

[The helicopter lands. Akiyama, Saejima, Tanimura and Kiryu get out.]

Chief Munakata: Who are you?

Akiyama: Okay, everyone pick an ass to kick.

[Saejima picks Kido.]

Saejima: Kido-chan. When you were flounderin'... I told ya to go balls out. No regrets. Only fair I practice what I preach now.

Kido: Saejima-san…

[Kiryu picks Daigo.]

Kiryu: This is all my fault. I'm the one who forced the Tojo Clan on you. Left you on your own. But now... I'm done running. It's time I take responsibility for my mistakes.

Daigo: Kiryu-san…

[Tanimura picks Chief Munakata.]

Chief Munakata: You're...

Tanimura: The detective you thought Hisai-san rubbed out of the picture. Name's Tanimura. I hate people like you. Can't survive without others to do your dirty work. After the living hell you put Sugiuchi-san and Hisai-san through… I'm gonna put you away for a long time.

Chief Munakata: You arrogant brat...!

[Akiyama picks Arai.]

Arai: Flashy as always, Akiyama-san.

Akiyama: I'm kinda relieved. I was really starting to doubt my ability to judge people's characters. Turns out you dream even bigger than I expected. You get points for ditching Munakata. But claiming justice while you're pinching someone else's cash is just bullshit. So I'm gonna have to stop you.

Arai: You can try.

[He removes his jacket with one clean swoop. There’s no tattoo on his back.]

Akiyama: Huh. Look at you. You should have shown this kinda, ambition back when we first met. We could have avoided this whole mess.

Arai: What's done is done. No sense in regretting it.

Akiyama: Right. No regrets.

Arai: (screams) Let's end this, Akiyama!

[The fight begins! SHIN AKIYAMA VS Kanemura Enterprises Captain HIROAKI ARAI! Akiyama wins the heated battle! Next… Saejima. He slowly walks down to the small improvised arena and pulls off his jacket in one clean swoop, revealing his Tiger.]

Saejima: C'mon, Kido-chan. Your turn.

[Kido also takes off his sports jacket, revealing... nothing. Only beefy muscles.]

Saejima: Wow, big guns ya keep tucked away there. Like a tiger hidin' his claws.

Kido: When I saw that cash at Akiyama-san's place, I knew my big chance had finally come. It's just like you told me, Saejima-san. You only get one shot in this line of work. And my time is now. Never felt so sure of anything.

Saejima: Oh yeah? If ya think you got what it takes. I’ll put ya to the test!

Kido: It would be an honor.

Saejima: Same. No holdin' back, kid. And no cryin' like a baby if I break you in half. Got that?

Kido: Yes, sir.

Saejima: (screams) Balls out, Kido!

[They're banging their heads! TAIGA SAEJIMA vs TAKESHI KIDO of Kanemura Enterprises. Taiga crushes Kido with his enormous muscles and animal strength! Next… Daigo. Kiryu removes his jacket in one clean swoop revealing his Dragon tattoo. Daigo does the same and reveals his  Fudo Myoo, defender of the Buddhist faith tattoo.]

Kiryu: You ready to finish this?

Daigo: I am. It were you, you'd probably try to rebuild the Tojo on your own, without all this money.

Kiryu: Hard to say for sure. I'm not standing in your shoes.

Daigo: If I could leave the clan to you, I would. But I'm too prideful for that. I need to set an example for my men. Everyone who's followed me all this way. Just like you did for me.

Kiryu: Daigo.

Daigo: I never thought we'd end up going toe-to-toe again after all these years. But I have to say. I'm grateful for the opportunity, Kiryu-san.

[Kiryu jumps to a small round balcony.]

Kiryu: Come on! Leading the Tojo is a heavy cross to bear. It's time you learn just how heavy.

Daigo: We'll see about that, Kiryu!

[He jumps to Kiryu, striking a punch! Kiryu blocks it and the fight begins. KAZUMA KIRYU vs Tojo Clan Six Chairman, DAIGO DOJIMA!!!]


Tanimura: You know what? I'm not gonna arrest you. I'm turning in my badge, Deputy Commissioner.

[He throws his badge to Munakata’s feet.]

Chief Minakata: What are you getting at?

Tanimura: What I'm about to do goes against pretty much every rule in the police handbook.

Chief Minakata: Spare me.

[He waves his hand and a squad of Special Forces walks to him.]

Chief Minakata: What can you do against all of these men? You'll die like a dog. Just as your father did.

Tanimura: Munakata-san. You just don't get it, do you? In this town, there are men who'll take down a hundred guys by themselves if they have to. Like them.

[He points to Akiyama, Saejima and Kiryu who already defeated their opponents.]

Tanimura: Sorry, but you're out of touch with how this city works. How about I refresh your memory?

Chief Minakata: (to his men) Don't just stand there! Crush this rat!

Tanimura: Deputy Commissioner... No. Seishiro Munakata! Your ambitions end here. You're mine!

[He runs to Munakata fighting the Special Forces along the way. It seems they’re as bad in hand to hand combat as they are in using weapons. Tanimura jumps away from the bodyguards, aiming to hit Munakata, but one of his men blocks the blow. Now Tanimura has to fight them all at once. Tanimura falls to the floor numerous times, but continues to fight and eventually wins. Munakata crawls away from Tanimura walking toward him. Akiyama, Kiryu and Saejima join Tanimura. Munakata crawls toward Daigo.]

Chief Minakata: Hey, Chairman! Chairman Dojima! You're yakuza! You're powerful! Do something! Come on!

Daigo:I should've known... I'm no match for him. (to Munakata) I suggest you start thinking about what comes next. It's time we all face reality.

Chief Minakata: What're you saying? Come on, get up!

[Tanimura pulls out his Colt Detective.]

Akiyama: Hey…

Kiryu: Wait!

[He walks to Tanimura but Kiryu stops him.]

Chief Minakata: (frightened) Tanimura-kun! Let's not be hasty here! Do you have any idea what happen if you go through with this!?

[Tanimura shoots several times near Munakata. He squats down in fear and covers his head with his hands. Arai suddenly approaches with a pistol, most likely SIG-Sauer P230, in his hand.]

Arai: He doesn't have the right to die. I get it now. Finally.

Tanimura: Arai…

Kido: Aniki.

Chief Minakata: (shivering in fear) Arai! You son of a...!

Arai: Munakata-san. Are you afraid? Well, you'll need a lot more than that. After all the lives you've stamped out, a moment of fear simply doesn't equate. Death would be a mercy to you. Instead you'll spend the rest of your life in the very prisons you used on so many others. And I'll be right there next to you.

[Arai throws his pistol, then lowers Tanimura’s revolver.]

Arai: Thank you. The police force as I knew it... only cared about power and greed. But meeting a cop like you in the end... makes it a bit easier to pass the torch.

[He bows to Akiyama. Akiyama smiles. Then Munakata starts laughing madly.]

Chief Minakata: You really believe this will bring me down?

Tanimura: What?

Chief Minakata: (stands up) Me, thrown in prison? Need I remind you who I am? I'm second in command of the entire force. A couple of trumped-up charges means nothing to me!

Tanimura: We can prove every single one of your crimes. We have the receipts. What's stopping me from hauling you in?

Chief Minakata: You beat cops are even dimmer than I thought. The police are the law. A virtuous organization meting out justice to the people of this country. What do you think happens if one of its figureheads is arrested? This nation of fools would plunge into chaos. The force would never stand for it. Those who hold power are protected by it. Do you know why? Because that is this country's very foundation. If you want to shoot, now's your chance. But know you'll all rot in prison if I die here. Is that really what you want? Well, what'll it be? I'm waiting! (laughs madly) All this effort, just to choke in the decisive moment! This is too funny!

Akiyama: Hey. You want something to really .chuckle about

Chief Minakata: What?

[Akiyama pulls out his phone and calls someone.]

Akiyama: Yup, it's me. You good to go? Okay. Let her rip.

[A helicopter flies in with Date and Sudo on voard.]

Date: (cheerfully) It's showtime, Sudo!

Sudo: Date-san! You never mentioned this! Using a police chopper for your personal paper?

Date: How am I supposed to justify that!? This one's for the people of Japan! You can worry about justification later!

[Date drops thousands of flyers from a helicopter. People on the street collecting money that has fallen from the Millennium Tower begin collecting these flyers as well.]

Chief Minakata: What's this?
[We are not allowed to read the writing on the flyer in full, but the translation reads as follows...]

Tokyo PD Deputy Commissioner Corrupt!

[The flyer is dated March 15.]

Chief Minakata: (picks up one of the fliers) How did you...

Akiyama: We've got a damn fine journalist in our corner. What do you think of his big scoop? Oh yeah, and you know that file you were after? We're the ones who slipped him a copy.

Chief Minakata: (angerly) You son of a...!

Akiyama: Might as well be your obituary.

[Munakata quickly grabs the P230 lying on the floor and shoot Akiyama in the heart.]

Chief Minakata: Die!

Kiryu: Akiyama!

[Everyone shocked.]

Kido: Akiyama-san!

Tanimura: Shit!

[He knocks the gun out of Munakata's hands with a kick.]

Kiryu: Hey, Akiyama! Akiyama! Hang in there!

Saejima: Akiyama!

Tanimura: Akiyama-san!

Kiryu: Where did he get you, Akiyama? Stay with me!

[Suddenly Akiyama… stop dying.]

Kiryu: What is it?

[A wad of cash in his pocket tops the bullet.]

Akiyama: This.

Saejima: Fuckin' miracle.

[Arai steps on his gun on the floor.]

Chief Minakata: Arai...

Arai: Let's stop this madness, Munakata-san.

[And so Minkata is handcuffed. Tanimura picks up his badge. Akiyama looks at the stack of cash that saves his life.]

Akiyama: Look at that. Guess there's no escaping this stuff after all. Here I thought to hell with it. And now it goes and saves my life.

Kido: Talk about another level. No topping those four.

[Munakata looks at the gun, which again no one thought to put away and quickly grabs it. In the black screen comes the sound of a gunshot.]

Two Weeks Later
March 30th, 2010 Kamurocho

[A young girl wearing a long gray raincoat similar to the one Yasuko wore walks down Tenkaichi Street. She stumbles upon a newspaper that says the following...]

Deputy Commissioner's Death a Suicide? Or Maybe a Corruption Cover-Up?

{The newspaper is dated March 25. It reads as follows - 警視庁副総監 宗像氏自殺説も(Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, Mr. Munakata, is believed to have committed suicide.), 汚職の事実隠しか? (Covering up the fact that he was corrupt?), 自らその命を絶つ (Takes his own life)}

[Tanimura sleeps in a car nearby.]

Tanimura: Slow-ass. How long is he gonna make me wait? I swear once you hit 40 it's all just talk, talk, talk.

[The girl goes up to Akiyama's office. Having just woken up, he invites her to sit down on the couch.]

Akiyama: My bad, ma'am. Come in, come in. Please, take a seat. Sorry it's not the cleanest. (quickly cleans up) My secretary left a while back, so… Sad, isn't it? I'm practically useless on my own.

Girl: I'm surprised you've even remembered to breathe while I'm gone, Chief.

Akiyama: You're...

Hana: I'm back, Akiyama-san.

[She lost a couple of kilos and changed quite a bit.]

Akiyama: Hana-chan? (drops an empty bottle) What the heck happened to you? You're skinny as a rail...

Hana: I guess you're not the only one who's useless on their own. I've barely eaten a thing since I left. So Chief... What would you say to giving me my old job back?

Akiyama: Hana-chan.

[He slowly approaches Hana. She closes her eyes in preparation for a kiss, but Akiyama apparently doesn't even think about kissing her.]

Akiyama: Oh, hold on a sec. I've got some spare yakiniku bentos from over at Kanrai. You want one?

[Hana snorts unhappily.]

Akiyama: I thought you'd be back any time so I kept stocking up on them. You're so skinny, you must be hungry enough to eat a horse!

Hana: Chief! Would it kill you to stop for just one second and tell me how pretty I am!?

Akiyama: Oh, yeah you look great.

Hana: Ugh! Say it like you mean it! (screams) What happened to my poor client registry!? It looks like a tornado struck down in here!

Akiyama: Huh, maybe it did.

Hana: C'mon, Chief! Why's this always happen when I'm not around!?

Akiyama: So, Hana-chan. How many of those Slunches you want? I’ve got plenty. 

Hana: Fine, give me three!

[Meanwhile on the roof…]

Kiryu: So. You're finally going back, Date-san?

Date: Don't say it like that. You make it sound like I'm getting back with my ex-wife or something.

Kiryu: That's not too far off. You always were married to the force.

Date: Anyway, what about you? You ready to head out?

Kiryu: Yeah.

Tanimura: Hey, what's taking so long up there? Date-san! We need to get a move on here! You want Sudo-san chewing us out? Hurry it up already!

Date: Okay, okay. Sorry, gotta run.

Kiryu: Yeah. See you around.

[CREDITS]

[After the credits Kiryu stands near the entrance to the Tojo HQ.]

Haruka: Are you going now, Uncle Kaz?

Kiryu: Yeah. I might be a while. Think you'll be okay?

Haruka: All right. I'll be back.

[Kiryu walks in. Hundreds of yakuzas bows to him. Kiryu hears a car drives in. Saejima in classic Japanese attire walks out of it.]

Yakuzas: Welcome back, sir!

[Saejima walks to Kiryu. They both look at the Tojo HQ.]

Kiryu: This clan is the only proof we ever walked this earth.

Saejima: Yup.

Kiryu: Serve it well. You and the whole Saejima Family.

Saejima: Ya can count on it.

[He looks at a sign that reads.]

Tojo Clan, Saejima Family Patriarchal Inauguration

[Majima and Daigo stand nearby.]

Kiryu: Come on. We have work to do.

FIN
