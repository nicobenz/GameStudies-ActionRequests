Chapter 5: Dogged Pursuit


[A train rushes along the monorail road at a huge speed. On the roof of this train stands a blonde young man with a huge sword behind his back. The train slows down sharply at the end station. Two guards walk out of the guard post. They split up to examine the train. Suddenly, the first guard groans quietly in the distance and the second guard goes to check on him. A man and a woman run up to him and knock him out. A large black man wearing sunglasses named Barret comes out on the platform.]

Barret: Get down here, merc.

[The young man jumps on a platform.]

Chapter 1: The Destruction of Mako Reactor 1
[Two more guards are coming out on the platform.]

Security Officer: Halt!

Security Officer 2: Who goes there!?

Barret: You're up.

[The young mercenary sighs and takes out his huge sword.]

Security Officer: You're coming with us.

Cloud: Don't think so.

[He's quick to deal with the guards.]

Cloud: Not bad.

Security Officer: Who in the hell—!? Hands where I can see 'em!

[Barret and the others are running away.]

Jessie: Have fun!

[Cloud goes into battle.]

Security Officer: Freeze! Move and we shoot!

Cloud: Go ahead.

Security Officer: Holy shit! Drop the weapon!

Biggs: You got this!

Wedge: Yeah, what he said!

Security Officer: You're coming with us!

Cloud: Can't get surrounded.

Cloud: Try harder. Nope.

[He defeats another batch of guards.]

Jessie: So what's SOLDIER boy's deal? Is he one of us now? He's got balls, this, uh… Uh… what was his name again?

Biggs: Cloud. Cloud Strife.

Jessie: Right.

Biggs: And he isn't a SOLDIER anymore. Still, he's a professional unlike the rest of us. I'm glad to have him.

Cloud: This is a onetime gig. When it's done, we're done.

Wedge: You'll keep us safe… right, Cloud? Wow, they've almost got the door. C'mon, nobody'd do something this crazy just for money. They may not think you're a true believer, but you know what I think?

Cloud: Not interested.

Barret: Wedge! (to Cloud) You'd better be worth the money, merc. Every last gil.

[Cloud protects the group by destroying security guards.]

Security Officer: Get him, boy!

Cloud: Guess you're first.

Security Officer: Hey!

Cloud: Looks like you're next.

Security Officer: I found one!

Wedge: Hey, Cloud! Elevator's over there! Catch up soon!

Biggs: This way! Not so fast. We've got company.

Security Officer: There's one! Get him!

Barret: You know what to do—now go!

Wedge: See you later!

Jessie: C'mon, Cloud!

Barret: Pick up the pace!

[They're running into reactor number one.]

Barret: SOLDIERs may attack on command, but I hear they make good guard dogs too. Bet you've seen a few reactors. So how do we get to the bridge above mako storage? Ain't holding out on me, are you? Stamp scared to bite the hand that fed him? Or is he a loyal little doggy!? Have it your way, mutt. We can do this with you, or we can do this without you.

Cloud: Different reactor, different layout. Depends when it was built. Never seen one like this, but I'll manage.

Barret: I'm watching you.

Jessie: Don't you worry. Biggs'll have the door open soon.

Biggs: In three, two… Damn, I'm good!

Security Officer: Who's there!? Door!

[They lock the door behind Cloud, separating him from the rest of the group.]

Barret: W-wait!

Security Officer: It's over!

Cloud: That's my line.

Security Officer: He's alone! We can take him! Make it rain!

Cloud: You've got this.

[Cloud defeats the arrogant guards, while Wedge reopens the door.]

Jessie: We're back!

Cloud: Then let's move.

Jessie: He always knows just what to say!

Barret: Cut it out!

Biggs: I got this place covered.

Barret: Simmer down, hotshot.

Jessie: It's a good thing I know someone who can get us the passcodes. Pity no one else at command will talk to us, but what can you do? And we're good!

Biggs: Careful in there. Well, what're you waiting for?

Barret: Security's only gonna get tighter, so be ready. We can't afford any more mistakes.

Jessie: Looks like the elevator's on another floor. Mind pushing that button? So… you know Tifa, right? It's not really my business, but are you guys close?

[Cloud flinches and remembers events from his past.]

Tifa: Cloud! Are you ignoring me!?

Cloud: Tifa and I…

[They're getting in the elevator. Barret pushes Cloud away and gets in first. Meanwhile, at the security post, some people are monitoring the elevator through security cameras…]

Heidegger: These sewer rats appear to call themselves Avalanche, sir. We are currently investigating whether they belong to the same group that made the attempt on your life. Rest assured, our inquiries will not take much longer.

Barret: (speaking a bit too loud) This pump's sole purpose is to drain the planet dry. While you sleep, while you eat, while you shit it's here, sucking up mako. It doesn't rest and it doesn't care! You do realize what mako is, don't you? Mako is the lifeblood of our world. The planet bleeds green like you and me bleed red. The hell you think's gonna happen when it's all gone, huh!? Answer me! You gonna stand there and pretend you can't hear the planet crying out in pain? I know you can!

Cloud: You really hear that?

Barret: Damn straight I do!

Cloud: Get help.

Barret: Say that again!

Cloud: I'd worry less about the planet and more about the next five seconds. Save the screaming for later…

Barret: Our lives are on the line now. You listening, merc? One false move… (he shoots his handgun to the camera) And that happens!

Jessie: Well, so much for having Cloud do all the fighting. There are some places a sword just can't reach… Just… bear with him for me, would you?

Cloud: Should've asked for more money.

[He notices an automatic turret and prepares for battle when Barret Wallace suddenly decides to join him.]

Barret: Gonna throw your sword at 'em? Let the man with the gun go to work! These tin cans ain't got nothing on me! Now for the real show! Do your job, 'merc! Shut up and move over.

[They win and the group goes down a few floors below.]

Jessie: Look what we have here.

Cloud: A laser security system… Great.

Jessie: Those things'll hurt more than your pride if you're careless. They'll cut you down to size and then some. …But I'm guessing you've done this kind of thing before.

Cloud: Yeah. Figure out the timing of the lasers. Then make a move when they cycle off.

Jessie: Exactly! I'll go first. Nothing like a little danger to get the blood pumping!

Cloud: Hey!

Jessie: Just keep those baby blues of yours on me!

[Cloud catches the moment and passes the lasers.]

Jessie: Huh. He's a natural! Not too shabby. You're doing good, SOLDIER! Okay, let's see what's up next! …And it's more of the same. Come on, then. Pretty easy, right? Nice job, Cloud! Like a walk in the park, huh? Not a scratch! Now on to the objective! Look.

[The way to the far door is blocked by a funny robot that looks like a barrel on legs.]

Jessie: They don't call those things sweepers for nothing. They can wipe out a whole squad in seconds.

Cloud: Not if you wipe the floor with them first.

Barret: Hah! We can take this hunk of junk!

Cloud: That "hunk of junk" is a heavy weapons platform. "If we rush in… we die.

Barret: Is that right?

Cloud: Need to hit it with magic. That should give us an opening.

Barret: Hey! It stopped moving!

Cloud: Let's pin it down! Give it all you've got!

Barret: Of course, it just had to get back up.

Cloud: So we knock it down again. No time to complain.

Barret: Now's our chance! Go!

Barret: Don't need to tell me twice! I'm gonna enjoy this!

Jessie: And that's that!

[They defeat the robot.]

Barret: What are you, twenty-something?

Cloud: First.

Barret: Huh?

Cloud: SOLDIER: First Class. Doesn't go into the twenties.

Barret: The hell you talking about? I mean your age, not your goddamn rank!

Cloud: I, uh…

Barret: Though, for all I know, a SOLDIER's rank could be the same as his age… Mm-hmm. Guess that'd make you a one-year-old, huh? Live and learn!

[They go out into a massive hangar.]

Jessie: That's our target. The reactor core. Gotta set the bomb at the bottom. Let's get down there.

Barret: Goddamn… I can practically taste the mako in here… Hurry it up! My heart's pounding like a jackhammer!

Cloud: Scared, huh?

Barret: Hah! More like excited. I've been dreaming about this for years!

Jessie: Heads up, boys—the end's in sight. I leave the rest in your capable hands. Good luck! Aw, you're choosing me over the reactor? That's sweet, but I'll wait my turn. Go blow her mind. Go on. Shoo. Not that way! Down the ladder, dummy!

Barret: You think, if we fell in, we'd sink right down to the bottom? To the planet's core? No, the pump would suck us back up.

Cloud: No, the pump would suck us back up.

Barret: How comforting. Yeah, let's do this… Let's do this!

[They're coming up to the reactor itself.]

Barret: All right. Let's see if little Stamp really can bite the hand that feeds… Go on. Do the honors. Prove to me you're the man Tifa says you are. That you're one of us.

Cloud: Never said I was. I'm just here for the paycheck.

Barret: Then do the damn job!

[Cloud comes to the reactor, but then he gets a bad headache.]

Barret: What's wrong?

Cloud: I'm fine. What about the timer?

Barret: Your call, merc.

[Cloud has to choose - twenty minutes or thirty minutes. He chose twenty.]

Barret: Pretty cocky, ain'tcha?

[Cloud doesn't have time to run the timer like someone or something flying into the hangar. For some reason, Barret sees it as a betrayal attempt and is pointing his gun at Cloud.]

Barret: You double-crossing—

Cloud: Heads up!

Barret: What in the hell!?

[A creepy red robot scorpion jumps on the platform. The terrorists are forced into battle.]

Barret: Hey! How the hell do we fight this thing?

Cloud: It's got reinforced armor plating but the internals can be overloaded. Lightning magic.

Barret: No other option, huh.

[He attacks with electricity.]

Barret: Hell yeah! You see the damage that did!?

Cloud: Keep it up!

Barret: Gotta win this one for the planet. The hell is that!?

Cloud: A barrier? Never seen this defense system before…

Barret: Thought you were the expert!

Cloud: So what's your brilliant plan, genius?

Barret: It's my time to shine!

Cloud: Or go down in flames… Bingo. Focus on that core!

Barret: Oh, now he remembers. Don't keep me waiting in suspense next time! Huh!? It didn't work!? If we don't change it up soon, this thing's gonna kill us both!

Cloud: Less talking, more shooting!

Barret: How 'bout less lip from you!?

Cloud: Dammit. Now! Hit it hard and fast!

Barret: Ohhh, you're in for it now!

Cloud: Just. Shoot. Gotta heal up.

Barret: Damn pain in the ass…

Cloud: Watch the tail! You don't want to be hit by that laser!

Barret: Huh!? So, whadda we do!?

Cloud: Don't get hit! Take cover behind that debris!

Barret: Now! Get in there and do some damage!

Barret: Sure could use a break… Can keep going if I heal up… Hey, it's doing that thing again!

Cloud: Find cover and hunker down!

Barret: Again and again and again! Now! Get in there and do some damage! Been a while since I had to go all out… Aw, hell, what's it doing now!?

Cloud: An auto-repair unit? Dammit—we gotta take it out quick or we're screwed!

Barret: Oh, I am way ahead of you, merc! When I get my chance, I'm gonna blow this bastard the hell up! And that's a promise!

Cloud: Don't let up!

Barret: Shit! The bomb!

Announcement: Twenty minutes until detonation.

[They defeat the scorpion robot and it falls off the platform.]

Barret: Hah, you hear that? Damn thing showed you how it's done!

Cloud: Come on, we've gotta move.

Barret: Wedge should be covering our way out! Go, go, go!

[Barrett runs away and Cloud runs after him. He only has 20 minutes to get out. The hangar starts to collapse and a piece falls on Jessie. Cloud runs up to her and frees her.]

Cloud: You okay?

Jessie: Do I look okay!? Help a girl out, would ya!? My hero!

Barret: Hey! We'll link up over there! Look after Jessie!

Jessie: Come this way! This route should lead us straight to Barret! Probably! I think I see an exit. Come on! Don't look back! Let's go, let's go, let's go! We're running out of time!

Cloud: Shut up and climb. You’re not helping.

Jessie: Sorry, it just—It keeps me focused! I’ll freak out if I don't talk!

Cloud: Have it your way.

[They're being attacked by some flying flowers.]

Jessie: Barret—

Barret: I’ll got you covered. Find us a way outta here!

Jessie: But then—

Barret: Don't worry, I'll be fine! I've got SOLDIER boy with me!

Cloud: Ex-SOLDIER boy.

Security Officer: They're here! Take 'em down!

Barret: We don't have time for this shit! The clock's ticking!

Cloud: Cool it. Five seconds is all we need.

Barret: Let's go! The others are waiting! Gotta get the hell outta here ASAP…

[They're being attacked by a funny robot again.]

Barret: Ugh! This is all we need!

Cloud: You got that right.

Barret: Heads up! We got a whole lotta company!

Cloud: No shit.

Barret: Whoa! Ain't you a feisty one!

Cloud: Like a rook seeing his first action.

[In the last seconds, a squad runs into an elevator. Meanwhile, a man on the control panel nods to his subordinate.]

Heidegger: Sir.

[He presses the button on his smartphone.]

Barret: (nervously) Come on… come on, come on, come on!

[He looks back at Cloud and sees that he keeps his cool and he is overcome with shame. They're coming out of the elevator.]

Jessie: Door's open!

Biggs: Bada-bing bada-boom-bam!

Jessie: We don't have a lot of time here! Pick up the pace, people!

Wedge: Over here! This way!

[Jessie's getting another piece of debris on her head.]

Cloud: Can you walk?

Jessie: If I couldn't believe me, you'd be the first to know.

Cloud: I'll take that as a yes.

[On the bridge on which they run, a pipe falls, separating the terrorists.]

Jessie: Cloud!

[But as it turns out, it's no problem for trained Cloud. He jumps off part of the bridge and gets to the other side.]

Jessie: Okay, that was pretty cool. All right. Come on!

[People on the street watching the reactor explode. How much trouble the people of this city would suffer through I can only guess.]

Chapter 2: Fateful Encounters
Barret: Looks like we made it. And with nothing but a few scratches to show—

[A small earthquake occurs.]

Barret: Think you might've overdone it?

Jessie: I followed the instructions to the letter. Maybe it triggered a reaction with the mako?

Barret: Well, let's hope this city's still in one piece.

Biggs: But the planet's what matters, right?

[And another one…]

Biggs: I mean… this must've helped some.

Jessie: After all that, it'd better have. Anyway, let's get going. We in Sector 8?

Wedge: That'd be just down there!

Barret: All right, then. Lead the way.

Wedge: You got it! Watch out for live wires. They're everywhere.

Biggs: Ugh, the air in here reeks. Can't wait to get out in the open! Man, what is that? I've never smelled anything so foul. Aw, it's me. Gotta do something about that, and soon.

Wedge: I felt that one in my guts…

Biggs: They just keep on coming.

Barret: We need to get out of this place.

Jessie: Was it the mako density? The primary explosive? The blasting agent?

Biggs: Hey, we can figure that out later.

Wedge: I'm running on empty here…

Barret: You can refuel at the base.

Wedge: Next time, I'll have to bring a little pick-me-up.

Jessie: How much farther do we have to go?

Wedge: Not far! That's about as good a place as any.

Jessie: Stand back then. I'll set the bomb.

Barret: Can't wait to see you, Marlene.

Biggs: Can't wait to take a hot shower.

Jessie: She's good to go. Fire in the hole!

Biggs: You sure told those doors.

Jessie: Let that be a lesson to anything that gets in my way!

[Our young terrorists are getting to the city where they're already being hunted.]

Announcement: Attention all citizens. Attention all citizens. This is an alert from the Shinra Emergency Operations Center. Unidentified intruders have detonated a bomb inside Mako Reactor 1. Multiple explosions have been confirmed, as well as ongoing fires. In response, a disaster warning has been issued in Sectors 1 and 8. Structures in the area are at high risk of collapse, rendering the entire sector hazardous.

Jessie: No… No way.

Biggs: This couldn't have been us… could it?

Wedge: But what if it was…?

Cloud: What's done is done.

Barret: Merc's right. It ain't pretty, but we can't stop now. This was just the first reactor. And the planet won't be safe till we get the rest.

Biggs: Yeah… We always knew this was gonna get messy.

Wedge: And this is only the beginning…

Barret: Y'all gotta look at the bigger picture here. Nothing worth fighting for was ever won without sacrifice. Though you may not be crying out, I know you're in pain-just like the planet. But it's okay, 'cause I'm here for you! To help take the load off your shoulders! Your fears… Your worries… Your concerns… And yes, your fees… Whatever your problem, I got you.

Biggs: So, what's our next move, boss?

Barret: That's easy enough! We get our asses home!

[The group disbanded.]

Barrat: We'll split up and shoot for the last train home. Regroup in the freight car. Got it?

Wedge: Later then!

Cloud: Hey. I'd like my money now.

Barret: You can have it—once we're back at base.

Jessie: Yoo-hoo. I don't need to tell you what this is, right?

Cloud: Of course not. It's healing materia.

Jessie: You can have it. For saving my life.

Cloud: Just doing my job. Nothing more.

Jessie: Yeah, yeah… Fact is, I’m lucky you were there.

Cloud: Survival can be a matter of luck or skill. And you can't rely on luck.

Jessie: Words to live by!

Cloud: Yeah, well… thanks.

Jessie: You do know how to use it, right?

Cloud: You do know what I was, right?

Jessie: Okay! I was only trying to help. Oh—before I forget, here's a little something extra, for being so brave. That really was the ride of a lifetime… Well, see you on the train! Cloud! Up here! Look up!' said look up! Careful up here! This could collapse at any moment! If you want up, you'll have to use those stairs!

[Cloud is walking around town looking for the station. On the way he hears moans, powerless anger and cries for help. ]

Topside Resident: If you really want to get to the station, you can always climb those stairs. Try picking your way across the rubble…

Cloud: Station's intact. What the…?

[He keeps walking to the station and notices a burning house with people left behind. At first it seems that he has finally been overwhelmed by his conscience and now he runs to their aid, but instead he notices a tall man with long hair of silver. He follows the man who looks like a fruit of a sick imagination, moving on from the burning house…]

Cloud: How…!? He couldn't be… But then… The hell…? You're not real… You're… dead!

Sephiroth: I am?

Cloud: I killed you with my own—

Sephiroth: Oh, you need not remind me. It was the crowning moment of our time together. But that was then, and this is now. I have a favor to ask. Our beloved planet is dying. Slowly. Silently Painfully. Can you bear to see the planet suffer…. Cloud?

Cloud: Mom… Mom…

Sephiroth: Were the planet to die, so many things would be lost. Your hometown burns so bright… The sound of her voice pleading for me to spare you. The shiver of her flesh yielding to cold steel. That which binds us together would be no more. And would be loath to live in such a world. Which is why I must ask you this one favor. Don't worry. It's a simple thing. Run, Cloud… Run away. You have to leave… You have to live.

Cloud: You bastard!

[He attacks the man, but he disappears. His voice keeps sounding in Cloud's head. ]

Sephiroth: Good, Cloud. Very good. Hold on to that hatred.

Cloud: I'm seeing things. Fumes from all the mako, maybe. All right. You got this.

[He keeps going to the station.]

Topside Resident: Sure, we could try the alley, but is getting to the station really worth breaking our necks over?

Topside Resident 2: Yes, because we won't.

Cloud: Man… What a mess. Security's everywhere…

[He notices a girl on the street who seems to have had too many illegal substances. She tries to fight off invisible demons. The same guy shows up.]

Sephiroth: You are too weak to save anyone. Not even yourself.

[Cloud grabs his head. It is not clear whether these events are happening in reality, or whether they are again a figment of his sick imagination.]

Flower Peddler: Are you okay!? Hey… Are you okay?

Cloud: I’m fine.

Flower Peddler: Here. This is for you.

Cloud: A flower?

Flower Peddler: That's right. It's a gift. You know, for scaring those things away.

Cloud: What things?

Flower Peddler: Never mind. Think of it as a memento.

Cloud: Just my luck…

Flower Peddler: I heard that, you know.

Cloud: How much?

Flower Peddler: Well, that depends on the customer. In your case… It's on the house. Lovers used to give these when they were reunited…

Cloud: Look, I'm involved in things. Dangerous things.

Flower Peddler: Oh, I'm sure you are. So?

Cloud: So keep your distance.

Flower Peddler: Wait you think someone's out to get you? Is that what you're all worked up about? Relax. No one's going to attack you. I promise.

Cloud: Hey, a mako reactor just blew. You shouldn't be out here trying to sell off—

[Flower girl starts fighting demons in her head again. She's probably having a seizure. Why don't you call 911 or just walk away like you did with that burning house?]

Flower Peddler: Help me!

[She grabbed his hand, dragging him into her nightmare world.]

Flower Peddler: What are they?

[Cloud swings off ghosts. At this moment, the military approaches him in order to cool off a mad teenager waving a huge piece of steel. Although they may have just followed the terrorists who blew up the reactor…]

Security Officer: Drop your weapon!

Cloud: Are you blind…?

Flower Peddler: You know you're right!

[The brave flower girl is running away.]

Cloud: Wha-Wait!

Flower Peddler: Nice meeting you!

Security Officer: Sword on the ground! Right now!

Security Officer: There he is! You're not going anywhere!

Security Officer: HQ, this is Sector 8 Unit 4. We have eyes on the target! We need backup. I repeat: this is 8-4 requesting immediate backup!

Cloud: Don't wanna stick around here.

Security Officer: Get 'em!

Security Officer: Just give it up! Don't run!

Security Officer: Box him in! Box him in! There's nowhere to run!

Security Officer: Don't let him escape!

Security Officer: Give up!

Security Officer: There's no way out.

Security Officer: Move in!

Cloud: So much for the direct route. Find another way… Use the rooftops, maybe… But the rooftops look clear.

Security Officer: Over there!

Security Officer: Open fire! Shoot to kill!

Cloud: Close call. It's all or nothing now…

Security Officer: Don't underestimate him!

Security Officer: I see him!

Security Officer: I have eyes on target. You're mine now.

Security Officer: Target spotted! Moving to intercept! Get the bastard!

Security Officer: He's here!

Security Officer: Not so fast!

[Two military cars are blocking the road.]

Security Officer: End of the line, punk!

Security Officer: I'm gonna enjoy this!

Security Officer: HQ, this is Sector 8 Unit 2. Target is surrounded. Moving to secure.

Security Officer: Wait! I know that—

[Cloud kills the nearest soldier and jumps onto a passing train under fire from a dozen automatic rifles without any problems. Moreover, the train turns out to be exactly where the rest of the group is.]

Wedge: Guess Cloud won't be joining us after all…

Biggs: No need to assume the worst. I'm sure he's fine. You saw him in action, didn't you? Guy's a SOLDIER. Goddamn one-man army.

Jessie: Mmm, you think he's a keeper?

[There's someone knocking on the car door. Of course it's Cloud.]

Barret: On my go. Ugh, you had me worried for a minute… What the hell you been up to? Huh!?

Cloud: Giving Public Security the runaround, that's what.

[So the military he killed was Public Security… interesting.]

Cloud: Had to draw them away from the station somehow.

Jessie: Nicely done.

Biggs: (to Barret) Well can't argue with results, huh?

Cloud: Wait. Got a question for you all.

Barret: What?

Cloud: Ever been attacked by an invisible enemy?

[Everyone looks at him like he's a moron.]

Cloud: Wearing robes. Came and went like the wind.

Biggs: Thought they were invisible…

Cloud: They were—at first. Only saw them after she grabbed me…

Jessie: A new Shinra weapon, maybe?

Barret: Hah! More like a panic-induced hallucination!

Cloud: Never mind. Forget I said anything.

Barret: Suit yourself. C'mon, let's move up.

Wedge: Lotta people here…

Jessie: And in the freight car, too…

Biggs: ‘Cause of the evacuation order, maybe?

Barret: Lucky us. We've got a crowd to hide in. Head for the front of the train and hold there.

Wedge: Ugh, so cramped… Man, everyone's on edge.

Cloud: Of course they are.

Wedge: Hey, Cloud, I, um…

Cloud: If you're about to "unburden" yourself don't.

Wedge: Yeesh… You don't make it easy…

Biggs: Hey, got a sec? You're uh…holding up pretty well, huh? Even after what we saw at the station and all over Sector 8?

Cloud: I'm a SOLDIER.

Biggs: Well… my hands are still shaking.

Cloud: You get used to it.

Biggs: Something to look forward to… Or maybe not.

Jessie: Little help, Cloud? Please? I can't stop thinking about it. The bomb I made shouldn't have produced an explosion that big. It doesn't make any sense…

Cloud: The explosion triggered a reaction with the mako. You said so yourself.

Jessie: That was my first guess but shouldn't a reactor have, fail-safes to prevent that kinda thing? You mentioned "invisible enemies" back there, right?

Cloud: Right.

Jessie: Hmm… No. I'm just looking for excuses for something that was clearly my own fault. Gotta own up to it if I'm gonna learn from this and move on. Thanks, Cloud. You're a good listener.

Shinra Employee: What kind of maniacs would go so far as to bomb a reactor?

Shinra Middle Manager: They've yet to announce it publicly, but I heard it was Avalanche's doing.

Shinra Employee: Really? Aren't they the terrorists who tried to kill the president? Is there nothing they won't do?

Barret: Hey! Quit talking out your ass. Everyone knows Avalanche only cares about saving the planet.

Shinra Middle Manager: J-just who do you think you are?

Barret: A law-abiding concerned citizen.

Shinra Employee: "Law-abiding"? Really?

Shinra Employee: Don't antagonize him!

Barret: In my humble opinion, that explosion was a message—a message to the bastards bleeding our planet dry. Think they got it? Heard it loud and clear? Y'all's masters?

Shinra Middle Manager: We will not submit to intimidation or violence! But work together for peace and prosperity! That is how civilized people change the world!

Shinra Employee: That's right! That is the Shinra creed!

Barret: Hmph. Them's fighting words.

Shinra Middle Manager: It's what we believe. We all have to follow our conscience, don't we?

Shinra Employee: We should go.

Shinra Middle Manager: Right…

Barret: You hear that suit? Shinra creed my ass. We're the good guys, dammit…

Wedge: They'd probably kill us if they knew we were the ones responsible…

Biggs: Well, I get it if you can't relate… Shower might help. A long, hot one.

Jessie: Let's get this out of the way… Personally, I find visual aids make the dull stuff a lot more bearable. If it helps, think of it as an initiation rite.

Cloud: How many times do I have to tell you people. I'm not—

Jessie: There's such a thing as playing too hard to get. So, here we've got a wireframe model of the great city of Midgar. Complete with massive steel plates suspended three hundred meters above ground level… Atop which stands a shining beacon of civilization. The whole system is sustained by the mako reactors, which feed the insatiable appetites of the public.

Announcement: The train will be passing through an ID checkpoint shortly.

Jessie: This here is the train's route. As you can see, it'll take us around this main pillar. Look—we're about halfway through it now. They’ve set up a checkpoint here to scan the IDs of all, passengers heading in and out. Date of birth, residential status, criminal history… All that and more is automatically cross-referenced in their databases. Public Security wouldn't have it any other way. Heads up. Don't worry. Our IDs are impeccable. What'd I tell you? Have a little faith. Won't be long till we reach the bottom. Relax.

Barret: Take a good look. It's because of that great big pizza in the sky that people down there gotta struggle to survive. Shinra sucks up mako while the soil turns to dust, the air fills with smog, and the flowers die.

Cloud: Then leave and don't look back. That's what's always worked for me.

Barret: Hmph! Well, that's all well and good if you're only out for yourself. But the folks down there don't have the luxury of choice, you know?

Cloud: Like this train, I suppose… There's only one way it can go…

Chapter 3: Home Sweet Slum
[Train arrives at the station. Passengers cheerfully run out of the train and hug their children, rejoicing that they have escaped from the hell our terrorists have arranged.]

Barret: Hot damn, we are good!

Wedge: Bombs detonated: one. Members lost: zero!

Biggs: And one step closer to a brighter future!

Jessie: Hell yeah!

[Hell it is.]

Barret: Guys! Lower your voices, huh? People are listening. Now get some R&R. You've earned it. Just be ready for the next mission, alright?

[Happy with their work, the squad members are scattering around.]

Barret: (to Cloud) See you soon. At Seventh Heaven? You know, where Tifa works? Don't keep her waiting. She'll worry. (from afar) Not long now, honey! Daddy's almost home!

[Cloud descends from the platform and enters the city. He meets a young man looking at the poster of our terrorist group.]

Undercity Resident: Hah. "Mako is the lifeblood of the planet"? The hell it is. Goddamn eco-warriors with their dumbass posters. I tear 'em down and they're back up inside of an hour! Like I've got nothing better to do… I mean, look at all that steelwork… You're trying to tell me that's not progress?

[Cloud seems to think a piece of metal is flying into his head. ]

Undercity Resident: What the - You okay, buddy? Mako junkie, huh? Figures…

[Case closed! Cloud is being attacked by invisible enemies again.]

Cloud: You again…

[After dealing with his demons, Cloud approaches the terrorist base. There's a girl and a little girl sitting on the porch.]

Tifa: Marlene!

Marlene: Daddy! You're home!

Barret: That's right, angel, I am!

Tifa: Welcome back!

Barret: Have you been a good girl?

Marlene: Yeah, I've been helping Tifa.

Barret: Oh, you did, did you? Well, well…

Tifa: (to Cloud) You made it. (looking at the flower) Where'd you get that? I can't remember the last time I saw a real one.

[Cloud gives a flower to Tifa.]

Tifa: How sweet. When did you get so thoughtful?

Cloud: A guy can change. Has been five years.

Tifa: Huh?

Cloud: I need to talk to Barret.

Tifa: Right. Come on in.

Marlene: Daddy, the mako place blew up. Everyone on TV's talking about it.

Barret: Don't you worry about all that silliness. Daddy's here, and he's not going anywhere tonight. Now turn that thing off and let's get you to bed, huh?

[Marlene looks at Cloud, gets scared and runs away.]

Barret: Hey! The hell you think you're doing scaring my daughter like that!?

Marlene: Daddy says never talk to strangers.

Barret: That's right, honey, I do say that. What a good girl you are, remembering Daddy's lessons. You know what else good girls do? They go to bed on time. C'mon.

Marlene: But I'm not tired! I wanna talk some more, Daddy…

Barret: Mmm… Alright but just this once!

Tifa: So, then! What can I get you?

Cloud: My money. I'm still waiting on it.

Tifa: Ah… Right… About that… We should talk. Outside.

Marlene: Um, Daddy…did the people who died all return to the planet?

Barret: Of course. Let that be a lesson to you.

[Cloud goes out on the porch.]

Tifa: Before we get onto money… There's an empty apartment in a place just down the road. It's nothing fancy, but… I was thinking you could stay there for now. The landlady's a big friend of the cause, so you wouldn't even have to pay rent! Sound good?

Cloud: Sure does. Thanks.

Tifa: Follow me then! How was it up on the plate?

Cloud: It was… chaotic.

Tifa: Sorry for dragging you into all this. It was wrong of me to put you in danger like that. I promise I won't do it again.

Cloud: Danger's part of the job. Don't worry about me.

Tifa: I’ll try not to.

Cloud: Always happy to help stick it to Shinra.

Tifa: So, you make nice with everyone?

Cloud: Much as I could, all things considered. Maybe not, enough for them.

Tifa: Good. You had me worried. You're not exactly a people person.

Cloud: I'll give you that.

Tifa: I saw Sector 8 on the news… It was like a war zone…

Cloud: The news is just another Shinra mouthpiece. They'll spread whatever lies Shinra tells 'em to.

Tifa: So… lit wasn't that bad?

Cloud: …It was.

Tifa: Oh. Right And here we are. Good ol' Stargazer Heights. You're on the second floor. Room 201 here is where I sleep. Don't have time for much else, what with Seventh Heaven and all. Not even time to decorate. Here's your room. 202. Don't worry, I already told the landlady about you.

Cloud: You did?

Tifa: Yes? Ohhh, I mean I told her I had a friend looking for a place to stay. Was that too much?

Cloud: No. It's fine. And this?

Tifa: That one's, uh… know what, it's getting late. I'll introduce you tomorrow. It's a little bare, but should be enough to get you through the night. If you want anything else, we can always get it

Cloud: There is one thing. My money. You guys owe me two thousand, remember?

Tifa: I do, and we'd love to settle up, especially since this was your first job for us, but…

[500 gil obtained.]

Cloud: That's it?

Tifa: Sorry. We spent the rest preparing for the mission. That really is it. But not for long! I'm collecting money for filters tomorrow, so I can pay you after.

Cloud: And you're sure about that?

Tifa: Of course… as long as you help, that is. Wait… Then I'd have to pay you for that too. Never mind.

Cloud: No, two thousand's enough. That's what we agreed on, so that'll be the price. With what you gave me, that leaves fifteen hundred.

Tifa: You're the best! I'll see you bright and early at the bar, then. Thanks again for everything. Sleep tight!

[She leaves. Cloud takes off his huge sword and goes to bed. In the middle of the night he hears a strange sound from his neighbour's apartment and jumps out of bed, ready for battle.]

Cloud: Guess it's time for introductions. Hey. You okay in there? Coming in.

[When he walks into a room, a glitch about a man with gray hair is visiting him again. Cloud tries to get his sword, but doesn't take into account that he's standing in a doorway and this huge swing just won't fit there.]

Tifa: Cloud! Stop!

Cloud: Get back inside! (to his glitch) Get off me!

???: Reunion… Reunion…

[Cloud is waking up.]

Tifa: What are you doing to Marco? This is his apartment. He's got a few problems, but he's not a bad guy. The landlady asked me to check on him now and then to make sure he's okay. May I ask you to do the same?

Cloud: Sure…

[In the morning, Cloud goes out for a walk.]

???: Well, now. You must be Cloud. I'm Marle, your landlady. So how'd you like the place? You from up on high?

Cloud: I've been around.

Marle: I'll bet. No matter. All kinds come through with all kinds of reasons. If you ever need an ear to bend, I'll lend you mine, Can be about anything—even Tifa.

Cloud: What's she to you?

Marle: The granddaughter I never had. And if you hurt her, I'll take it out of your hide. You hear me?

Cloud: Loud and clear.

Marle: Good! Now you'd best get a move on to Seventh Heaven! She's got a head start on you and then some. Come on, quit lollygagging and go to Seventh Heaven already!

Tifa: Morning!

Cloud: Hey.

Tifa: Just so you know, Marlene's still asleep. Let's get down to business, shall we? These water filters won't replace themselves. Although, the next batch probably could, if Jessie put her mind to it. Most every home in the area has one. Folks love 'em 'cause they practically eliminate the rotten-egg smell. Honestly, they make us more money than this place, And it's easy money too. We bring new filters, collect the old ones, and get paid. What?

[Cloud is moaning like he's hung over. Maybe he's actually taking drugs?]

Cloud: Gimme a break. I'm not a salesman. I'm a SOLDIER.

Tifa: Which is why no one will refuse to pay. What do you say? Please?

Cloud: Let's get this over with.

Tifa: Great. And while we're at it, I'll give you the grand tour. Go ahead and keep whatever we collect. Seeing as you didn't bring any luggage, I'm guessing there's snuff you need to buy.

Cloud: Thanks.

Tifa: And don't worry. We'll pay you the difference after. Barret's out making his rounds too.

Cloud: As long as I get it all today.

[Tifa and Cloud are wandering around town. There's a lot of people walking around. There's a lot of small shops open here and there.]

Tifa: Hey, there. Here to change out your water filter.

Item Store Owner: Tifa baby, how you doing? Been waiting for you to—Wait. Who's he?

Tifa: Cloud's in charge of collections. He'll take your money.

Item Store Owner: Sounds like a pretty sweet gig! If you ever need, someone to fill in, I'm your man.

Cloud: In your dreams, maybe.

[The owner looks pretty much gay.]

Item Store Owner: Huh?

Tifa: Cloud! Uh… since we're here, maybe we should do a little shopping?

Cloud: Suppose I could take a look.

Item Store Owner: Thanks! If you're ever in the market for anything else, drop on by. Especially if Tifa's with you.

Tifa: We'll see you around, okay? And let us know when your filter next needs changing! (to Cloud) He's a regular. Stock up here and he might throw in a freebie or two.

Cloud: For you maybe…

Tifa: Well… You could try being a little nicer.

Cloud: To get free shit? Not my style.

Tifa: Our next stop is Stargazer Heights. Landlady's a client.

Cloud: Just met her.

Tifa: Then you know what to expect. Remember: she's a good friend of Avalanche, so be nice. Please. Hey, Marle! Got some filters for you.

Marle: Tifa! My dear, dear girl! …Oh. What's he doing here?

Cloud: Working.

Tifa: Be nice! Cloud's helping me with collections.

Marle: You'd better take care of her!

Tifa: I'm pretty good at taking care of myself, you know.

Marle: That I do. Still, better him than you. No charm, no wit. Big sword… but no skills.

Cloud: I've got skills.

Tifa: Be nice!

Cloud: I'm doing my best…

Marle: You're looking awfully glum. Are you getting enough sleep? A good long rest'll cure anything, I tell you.

Tifa: A tried-and-true lesson for life on the ground floor, am I right?

Marle: That you are. Now your money.

Tifa: Thanks, Marle. You take care of yourself.

Marle: Don't do anything I wouldn't do!

Tifa: Marle's great. She helped get me set up back in the day.

Cloud: You… been here a while now?

Tifa: Five years, give or take… But never mind that! We've gotta get you your money! Last stop is the weapon store.

Weapons Vendor: Hey! That last filter didn't do shit!

Tifa: We're so sorry about that. Hopefully this one will work better…

Weapons Vendor: Save your excuses and get out!

Tifa: All right. If you could just settle your bill, we'll be on our way.

Weapons Vendor: The hell? You charging me for your busted-ass goods?

Tifa: My associate handles payment disputes…

Weapons Vendor: Think you can mosey up in here and have it your way?

Cloud: Pretty please.

[First terrorism, then threats and extortion. That's great.]

Tifa: Thank you very much! Seeing as we're done with our rounds, and you've got a small fortune now, why not take a gander at the weapons?

Cloud: Well… when will Barret be back with the rest?

Tifa: Before we open up tonight. It'll be a while yet, So…what do you wanna do?

Cloud: Don't really know…

Tifa: In that case, I've got a suggestion. Wanna hear it? If you're serious about becoming a merc, then you're going to need to start making connections. "It's not what you know, but who you know," y'know?

Cloud: Hmph. Another lesson for life on the ground floor?

Tifa: Yep. Connections get you jobs, jobs build your rep, and more rep gets you better connections…

Cloud: How do I start?

Tifa: Hmm…why not help out the neighborhood watch? They're mostly volunteers, but you'll get to know people.

Cloud: Yeah, okay.

Tifa: Didn't see anybody at the office, so let's head up top. Huh, didn't know you were holding down the fort.

Wedge: Oh, hey, Cloud. Looking to join the neighborhood watch?

Cloud: That depends. What does this neighborhood watch do?

Biggs: Umm… lots of stuff, really. But our top priority is taking care of any beasts that wander into town. That and teaching the locals how to defend themselves.

Wedge: Like they say: "The only one who'll look out for you is you."

Tifa: Cloud's a great fighter, but only we know that. If no one knows him, no one'll hire him. Though he joined the watch, he could get his name out there.

Wedge: That would work for everybody!

Biggs: Truth be told, we could really use your help. We can't pay you in gil, but we'll work something out. For example… Aha, what about your sword? I could mod it for you.

Cloud: No thanks. It's fine just the way it is.

Biggs: You some kind of a purist? I know I'd never pass up a chance to improve my gear. C'mon… at least let me show you how it's done.

[Cloud mods his huge hunk of metal.]

Biggs: All set? Needless to say, you'll have to try it out to appreciate the difference.

Cloud: Thanks!

Biggs: We'll do you one better—spread the word to everyone, who'll listen about the new merc in town.

Tifa: Between him and Wedge, there isn't anyone they don't know.

Wedge: I'll march through the streets singing your praises even on an empty stomach!

Cloud: So… where are these monsters?

Biggs: Scrap Boulevard. Good hunting.

Tifa: Hey, Cloud. I'll come with.

Cloud: No, I've got this.

Tifa: But… you don't know the way, do you?

Cloud: Lead on.

Tifa: Sure thing. I know these streets better than anyone. Scrap Boulevard is out west. Past the barricades supposed to keep the monsters out. Anyway, we should prepare, just in case. Here's Scrap Boulevard.

Cloud: I can see why monsters'd feel right at home.

Tifa: Hm. And the more we pile up, the more they show up. And there's our first challenger! Show me what you got, Cloud! Wow… So that's what a SOLDIER looks like in action.

Cloud: This was just a warm-up.

Tifa: I'll bet. Let's keep at it!You're good at this! Charging in like it was nothing…

Cloud: You too. It's a little surprising.

Tifa: Well, I've been here five years now. “If you don't look out for yourself, no one else will.” By the way that's one's gonna be on the test.

Cloud: This a lesson?

Tifa: Gotta learn if you're gonna stick around. Okay, let's wrap this up… Alright. I think that might be the last of them.

Cloud: They won't stay gone for long…

Tifa: Of course not. Even so, folks'll be grateful for the peace and quiet in the meantime. A win's a win, you know?

Cloud: True.

Tifa: Trust me—it'll do wonders for your rep. Right, let's go check in with Biggs and Wedge.

[Cloud tries to walk in the weapon store, but he gets a warm welcome.]

Weapons Vendor: Huh? I ain't got nothing for a punk-ass bitch like you! Get on outta here!

[He's going back to base.]

Biggs: Back already?

Tifa: Got every last one too. Now the slums should be safe.

Wedge: You guys are machines!

Biggs: Good job. Meanwhile, we told everyone we could about you.

Cloud: So I heard. I've gotta ask though. What did you tell them?

Tifa: It's alright. All you gotta do is keep up the good work. It'll pay off soon enough, I promise.

Biggs: How's the sword, by the way?

Cloud: Good.

Biggs: Glad to hear it. Seems like the perfect fit for you.

Cloud: Yeah. We've been through a lot—

Tifa: You okay?

Cloud: I’m fine.

Tifa: Been meaning to ask… After you left the village…

Cloud: It's a long story.

Tifa: I've got time! Why don't you tell me all about it while we try to rustle up some more work for you?

Wedge: That sounds great! I'll come too!

Biggs: Oh no you won't. Run along now, you two. Go on.

Tifa: Sorry. Maybe next time.

Wedge: No fair!

Biggs: Think about it for a second. They haven't seen each other in years. You'd be a third wheel!

Tifa: Hey, before we get back to it, why don't you check out the weapons?

Cloud: No need.

Tifa: C'mon, the dealer's probably heard all about you by now. Might treat you better.

Cloud: I dunno about that…

[They're going back to the weapon store where Cloud was extorting money by threatening bodily harm.]

Weapons Vendor: Hold up. Heard there's a merc that'll take on any monster. You the man?

Tifa: Word spreads fast around here.

Cloud: What if I am?

Weapons Vendor: Sorry 'bout before. I get antsy when business is slow. Man in your line of work needs weapons, no? Why not, try that one on for size? Yours on the house. Badass like you rocking my weapons is good advertising. Think about it.

Cloud: Fine.
Weapons Vendor: Or if you wanna take a look at something else…

Cloud: Just a look.

Weapons Vendor: Don't be a stranger.

Tifa: Since you've got yourself a new weapon, let's see if we can't put it to good use. Come on. Let's go chat up Wymer.

Cloud: Who?

Tira: The guy who tracks all the requests that come to the watch. You never know—could toss some work your way.

Cloud: Where's he at?

Tifa: Oh, he should be back at the office by now.

[They'll go to the street vendor on the street corner. His appearance brings back memories of Guy Ritchie's movies, which is cool.]

Wymer: Hey there, Tifa! You need a helping hand?

Tifa: Actually, I wanted to introduce you to an old friend of mine. This is Cloud. He's a merc.

Wymer: Hah, you don't say! Well, we're always on the lookout for experienced fighters to help us deal with the bigger critters.

Cloud: I'll take on anything. For the right price, that is.

Wymer: Experienced and cocky, huh? If it's a challenge you want, I might have a few good ones. Your clients can fill you in on the details. Prove yourself with these jobs, and I'll see if I can't find you some more.

Cloud: Thanks.

???: Candidate detected. Performing physical analysis… Sizable weapon, excellent cardiovascular health and impressive lung capacity. Perfectly balanced muscle and bone structure. An optimal candidate! My name is Chadley. I'm an intern for Shinra's Research and Development Division. I hope you'll be interested in helping me with my research. Please accept this as a down payment. I would like you to set that Assess materia in your equipment and use it to gather intelligence in battle. This data will help me to develop new types of materia.

Cloud: I'm not interested in working for Shinra.

Chadley: You should know that I work actively to undermine Shinra's efforts. I'm sure you of all people can appreciate the tremendous power of materia as well as how it might be wielded against your corporate enemies. And if you later decide that I am not worthy of your trust, you can do what you do best.

Cloud: I will hold you to that.

Chadley: Excellent! Then we shall work together so long as you deem fit. Once you've completed your task, please return and report to me. Please set the orb of Assess materia to your equipment, and use it to gather battle intel.

Wymer: You'll never want to work around here if you prove yourself useful.

[Tifa and Cloud leave and meet a little girl in the street.]

Betty: Oh, hey there! Uhh, is Marlene with you?

Tifa: No.

Betty: Oh, okay. I was kinda hoping she could help me find my friends.

Tifa: I know someone who can help you. This guy right here.

Betty: Really!? Okay! Lemme tell you all about them. They have long arms and legs. And they're a little skinny. They like places where there's food. And nice people who give them treats when they ask! And small spaces! Oh, yeah, and they're all cats!

Cloud: I'm looking for cats?

Betty: They're friendly, so if you call them, they'll come running. All three of them! Find my friends. Please! They love crowded places, like the road to the station. A lot of people stop to play with them there.

Tifa: Wait. Did you hear that just now? I think one of Betty's cats might be nearby. Ah! That was definitely a cat! I wonder if it's one of Betty's. I swear I just heard a cat. It's gotta be around here somewhere…

Undercity Resident: I'm trying to get a cat to come out. lt snatched one of my pastries and scurried in there. Will you be a dear and lend me a hand?

[When Cloud finds all the cats, he tries to pet one of them. It hisses and runs away.]

Cloud: This sucks. Ugh, screw this.

[Cloud and Tifa decide to go back to Betty.]

Betty: What? They ran away? So… I'm never gonna see them again?

[However, all three cats materialize from the thin air and approach her.]

Betty: You guys! You came back! They said that a scary man was chasing them! Thank you!

Tifa: That went well. Could be you've found your calling.

Cloud: Eh. Was alright I guess.

Tifa: Think of each job as an opportunity—not to make money, but to build connections.

Cloud: "It's not what you know, but who."

Tifa: You remembered.

Cloud: Had a patient teacher.

Tifa: Maybe not so patient next time.

Cloud: Hoo boy.

Tifa: Oh, Barret should've finished collecting his share of the money by now, so what do you wanna do? Head back to the bar?

[Cloud's going to the monsters' dump to collect some data for Shinra's employee.]

Cloud: There. That should be enough intel for the kid.

Chadley: Cloud. You were the first to gather the data I requested. Here is the rest of your payment. I have developed new materia. Would you like to see it? I plan to develop more materia in the future. Together, we can harness enough power to take down Shinra. I'll keep preparing more battle intel reports, which I hope you will assist me in completing.

Item Store Owner: Hey there, Tifa, welcome back! And you. The new merc in town looking for work, right?

Cloud: Yeah.

Item Store Owner: In that case, maybe you could do something about the doomrats? Them and their wererat buddies have been tearing up town, looking for food and whatnot. Got into the store and made one hell of a mess, let me tell you. Oh you think that's funny, do you? Don't lie. I saw you crack a smile. Well, do the job and you can laugh it up for all I care. Anyway…they're probably nesting in the outskirts. Now I've heard a wererat in pain'll call its friends for help. And the whole rat pack'll come running, just like that.

Cloud: I don't see any "doomrats" around…

Tifa: Hmm, what do you think? Should we wait? You know, this might be a waste of time. Let's head back to the store and touch base for now.

Undercity Resident: The leader of the rat pack is the worst of 'em all. The loudest, most obnoxious squeaking… Johnny liked to mimic it until we told him to cut that shit out.

Junk Dealer: Hello, hello! Oho, what do we have here? I'm guessing you're that merc I've heard so much about. You're not here to shop, are you? People were right. You look like you can handle yourself. So some drakes've made themselves at home in the abandoned Talagger factory. Can't have that kind of trouble around here. My regulars will do anything to get their hands on the scrap in there, and if they run into those drakes, they could get hurt.

Cloud: I'll handle it.

Junk Dealer: Much obliged, sir! Head on over to the old Talagger factory and talk to Narjin. He's the watchman guarding the entrance. Good luck! I'm counting on ya, my friend! Narjin's the one with all the details. You'll find him outside the old Talagger factory. Don't forget to stock up before you go!

Item Store Owner: Well? Rats too much to handle? I'm just messing with you. I heard you took out some wererats, which is nice and all, but the job was to wipe out the doomrats. No biggie—get back out there and finish the job and, we're good. Don't look so glum. It's only a matter of time till they show. You'll get 'em this time for sure!

[Cloud manages to find these unfortunate rats and hit them with his sword a few times.]

Item Store Owner: Finally managed to get those doomrats, huh? Thanks guys you're the greatest! Was so dead in here I thought I might have to close up shop for good. Hey—got an idea. Hear me out. If the guy who took care of the town's rat problem told everybody where he liked to shop… Well? Whaddya say? I’ll make it worth your while, of course. Give you some incentive. Talk you up to Wymer and my customers and anybody else who'll listen. You'll be swimming in work before you know it!

Cloud: Yeah, sure.

Item Store Owner: Okay then! That's what I like to hear! Seventh Heaven, the new merc in town, and my little store! I can see it now! We're gonna clean up!

[They leave the store and on their way to Wymer they see a huge crowd of citizens.]

Tifa: Something's wrong. Let's check it out.

Narjin: Factory's off-limits. Drakes have been spotted inside. Huh? Wait a minute. Tifa? Don't tell me you're here to take care of those things. Are you? In that case, be my guest! We believe there's at least two groups lurking somewhere inside the factory. Find and cull 'em all.

[Cloud walks into the factory and gets rid of monsters there.]

Junk Dealer: Got rid of those drakes in the factory, did ya? What a relief! I can't wait to give my regulars the good news! You're the real deal all right. Keep it up, and I can see you going far as a merc in this town. I've worked with my fair share over the years, so believe me when I say that I know what I'm talking about. Anyway you're needed over at the pillar. Apparently another flying bastard's stirring up trouble. Bet you can't get enough of this, eh?

Cloud: Well…

Junk Dealer: No, I get it. If you're good at something, might as well make it your living. May not know you, but I know a man who's found his calling when I see one. Keep at it! I switch out my stock every so often, so drop by when you're in the neighborhood, huh?

Tifa: I'll bet a lot of people are talking about you right now. "There's this amazing merc who can handle anything!"

Cloud: Nothing I've done around here has been all that special though.

Tifa: Oh, so you want more of a challenge, huh?

Junk Dealer: Welcome! I'm always getting in new stuff to keep up with the latest trends. You won't be disappointed! Always a pleasure. Oh you look into that other gig, yet? If you're planning to, might wanna buy some extra supplies first.

Undercity Resident: I'm guessing you're the merc who dealt with those damn rats? That wasn't me who put in the request, but as a resident of Culvert Street, I appreciate what you did.

[Finally our terrorists go to the crowd in the square. As it turned out, they gathered at the house of one Johnny, who was captured by the military.]

Johnny: Stay away from me!

[The military works quickly and efficiently - they put him on the ground, tie his hands and blindfold him for some reason.]

Johnny: Get off me, assholes! I didn't do shit!

Security Officer: Shut it, punk!

Johnny: Or what!? Screw you!

Tifa: What's going on?

Undercity Resident: "Somebody" went and stole some blasting agent from Shinra warehouse.

Tifa: So Public Security started asking questions, and you know how Johnny gets…

Undercity Resident: It's because of the reactor bombing, I bet. I could be wrong… But something tells me they're not gonna settle for just roughing him up this time.

Tifa: We've gotta save him, Cloud!

Cloud: Is he Avalanche?

Tifa: No. He doesn't really know what we do… but he has his suspicions. He's a talker. Actually, you know what… maybe I should go alone.

Cloud: I'm coming.

Tifa: Uh… are you sure?

Cloud: It's the least I can do. Lead on.

Tifa: Thanks. Come on!

[They're going on a chase.]

Johnny: What the hell, man!? You trying to break my arm!? Dragging me through the street like this is—ow—cruel and unusual punishment!

Tifa: Come on. Let's get a closer look.

Security Officer: Model citizens don't steal blasting agent! So why don't you tell me why your ID popped when we were going over the warehouse logs!?

Johnny: Huh? You've got it all wrong! I've never gone anywhere near a Shinra warehouse! Unless it was Jessie… She jacked my ID!

Security Officer: Your ID was never logged, dumbass. It would've never gotten you inside a Shinra installation in the first place! But don't you worry we'll take all the time we need to help you get your story straight.

Tifa: I’ll swear, all he had to do was keep his mouth shut.

Cloud: Yep.

Tifa: Anyway, you distract the officers, and I'll… figure something out.

Cloud: Let him go.

Security Officer: Who're you? The cavalry?

Johnny: Is that who I think it is!? Aw, hell yeah! You guys really came to save me! Ava—

Security Officer: Hey! The hell you think you're doing!?

Tifa: Here we go…

[They're going into battle with the military. Fists and iron against machine guns - the outcome is obvious. Our terrorists are winning.]

Tifa: Grab Johnny so we can get outta here.

Cloud: Alright.

Tifa: Wh-what now?

Cloud: He's a talker.

[He takes out his sword. Finally, the problems began to be solved in accordance with the given characters personalities.]

Johnny: Huh!? You're not gonna… Hold up! Wait! Don't—don't do it, man!

Cloud: You wanna live, then get the hell out of town.

Johnny: Y-y-you got it, boss! You ain't never gonna see my face again, I swear!

[He runs off to wash his pants.]

Cloud: Are you sure about this? It's a big risk.

Tifa: I know, but… it's fine.

Cloud: And them?

Tifa: No more… Cloud… You're scaring me. We need to go before they wake up. …I'm worried about Johnny.

Cloud: I'm more worried about us. We gotta go, right?

Tifa: Right…

Cloud: What? It's just… you've really changed.

Cloud: How?

Tifa: I suppose it's… yeah. Your eyes, They used to be less…

Cloud: It's the mako. SOLDIER, remember?

Tifa: …I remember. So what do you wanna do now? Head back to the bar? Or do you wanna tackle another job or two?

[Cloud doesn't answer and they go on until they meet a jaunty black girl arguing with the military.]

Gwen: Tifa! You won't believe this! A cerulean drake flew in from the train graveyard, but these two clowns refuse to get off their butts and do anything about it! Hey… Is that…? It is you! The new merc! Then maybe you can help us out? The drake is in the old Talagger factory over there, but to reach it you'll need to get ahold of a watch security key. You should be able to find one inside one of the crates forget which. Just smash 'em all.

[Cloud and Tifa go to the factory to kick monsters.]

Tifa: That the key?

Cloud: Yeah.

[They're going back to Gwen.]

Gwen: And there he is! I knew you were the right man for the job! There's no denying you're the real deal! Not like these idiots, with their excuses. Rather have one of you than twenty of them!

Cloud: They're just doing their jobs. Can't expect them to be at your beck and call.

Gwen: What exactly is it you're trying to say, merc?

Cloud: You need people who can follow order's too.

Gwen: I see now. Heard you were ex-Shinra. Guess I shouldn't be surprised you'd go to bat for your old buddies. Me, I'm just looking out for my people. All there is to it. Hell with you. We can take care of this town ourselves! No more mercs or Shinra—we'll build up the watch and kick you all out!

[Cloud decides to return to street vendor Wymer.]

Wymer: A certain shopkeeper told me you paid him a visit. Thanks for helping him out. Just so happens there's another job I'd like to offer you, now that I know you can handle yourself in a fight. We've got a real killer on the loose, you see. A rabid catch dog. Maybe you heard people talking about it? Shinra mutt gone feral. Last sighting was in Scrap Boulevard. Think you're up to it?

Cloud: I'll handle it.

Wymer: You're a lifesaver! Doubt anyone else around here stands a chance! Go get em, bud.

Chadley: I have to tell you that I am grateful for all of your help thus far. I've done it. I've developed a new materia! I look forward to receiving all of your future, battle intel submissions.

[Cloud goes to the dumpster and defeats the creepy thing.]

Cloud: Dammit.

Wymer: Hey! Over here! Tifa! Hey, Cloud! I drove the hound into the area up ahead. He's pissed, so make sure you're ready. Took care of the dog, did ya? Phew! We owe you one.

Cloud: Gotta say, I've never seen a Shinra breed like that before. Out of curiosity, when exactly did it show up?

Wymer: Oh, today. The first reports came in just this morning. Uh… why do you ask? Wait a minute… There's this crazy story about a Shinra research lab hidden right beneath our feet—under the slums.

Cloud: Huh. Really…? That's news to me.

Wymer: And here I thought you might know something I don't! Well, I guess not.

Cloud: It's a big organization. I'm sure there's lots of secrets I don't know.

Wymer: Yeah, fair enough. You got the bastard. That's good enough for me.

Tifa: Okay then! That's another solid gig in the books! You know the whole town is really impressed with what you've done. Keep it up and you'll have enough work to keep you fed for a lifetime!

Cloud: All thanks to you.

Tifa: And don't you forget it!

Cloud: So where do we get paid? The shop or something?

Tifa: Yeah, but why don't we head back to the apartments first? Take a quick breather.

Cloud: Which lesson was that again…?

Tifa: Lesson one. Got it? Anyway, let's go!

Marle: Huh? Someone's back awful early. Not that I mind! Would you two be dears and swap your filters out for me? I left them in your rooms.

Tifa: Sure thing!

Marle: Not so fast, you. Do me a favor. She needs a friend, a real friend.

Cloud: …We're already friends.

Marle: So when she talks, are you really listening? Thinking about her and her feelings? Or are you just going through the motions? Go on.

Tifa: Let's take care of this real quick, okay?

Cloud: Sure.

Tifa: Come over when you're done.

[Cloud changes the filter in an apartment, and walks into the apartment next door where Tifa is doing the same thing.]

Tifa: Gimme one sec. I'll be done in a bit. Finally! So. After you left the village.

Cloud: Hm?

Tifa: I let you off the hook before. Back at the hall. But not this time.

Cloud: Well, when we were kids… everybody wanted to be a SOLDIER, right?

Tifa: Yeah, I remember they were on the news every day during the war.

Cloud: Thing is, by the time I finally made it in, they didn't need heroes anymore. It was nothing like what we'd dreamt of. It was just… working for Shinra. Just…

Tifa: I'm sorry. I know it's a touchy subject.

Cloud: Not exactly small talk. Especially with someone you haven't seen in a while.

Tifa: I get it. Still, it's kinda funny. Us going our separate ways, thinking that must be it… that we'd never meet again and then here of all places we do. You know what? We should totally celebrate! Let's dress up and hit the town!

Cloud: Really?

Tifa: I mean, why not? It'll be fun!

Cloud: Do you even have fancy clothes?

Tifa: Not like fancy fancy, but I'll figure something out! What do you think would suit me, huh?

[Cloud has to choose between a mature, sporty or exotic outfit.]

Cloud: Something exotic?

Tifa: Uhhh… really? Then again, if we're making an effort… Be sure to pick an outfit that goes with mine, okay? This is gonna be so much fun, you'll see!

Cloud: Yeah… maybe.

Tifa: And on that happy note, I think it's time we headed back to the bar. C'mon!

Cloud: Uh, you don't need a break?

Tifa: Honestly, I'm feeling pretty good. Marle isn't always right you know. Hey, Marle. We took care of the filters, so we're gonna head back to the bar now.

Marle: Take care you two! …Oh? You're looking pretty chipper!

Tifa: Uh… I don't feel that different.

Marle: Must be my imagination then. Anyway! Keep your wits about you, merc! A token of my appreciation. Be good to her.

[Cloud takes the necklace and goes to the store.]

Item Store Owner: Keepin' your nose to the grindstone, huh? I've got just the thing for a go-getter like you!

Tifa: And here we are. You must be tired.

Cloud: Same as you, I guess.

Tifa: Could use a little something to take the edge off, right? How about a refreshing cocktail made by yours truly that you can sit back and savor? Yeah, I'm feeling it a bit too. Hey… Do you think you'll stick around a little longer?

Cloud: Maybe. Work for a minute, build up some savings…

Tifa: I see. So, what'll it be? Wanna head back out for a little while?

Cloud: Yeah, why not.

Tifa: Well? You wanna head inside?

Cloud: Yeah.

[They enter the base of the eco-terrorists. Barret and his daughter come up from a secret bunker like they have their own bat cave.]

Tifa: We're back!

Marlene: Did you… have fun?

Tifa: Lotsa fun.

Barret: Hey—need y'all downstairs.

Tifa: Uh… right now? Then the plan is….?

Barret: Marlene, wanna go wait for Jessie out front?

Marlene: Okay!

Tifa: Looks like we're officially on for tomorrow night, then. Gotta go over the details with the others.

Cloud: Before you do, about my pay—

Barret: You'll get your money! So sit down and shut up until we're finished. Double time, Tifa.

[He goes down to the secret bunker.]

Tifa: I'm really sorry… but it shouldn't take much longer. In the meantime… Grab a seat.

[He sits at the bar and Tifa stands at the counter.]

Tifa: What'll it be?

Cloud: I dunno… something hard and bitter.

[She's pouring him a glass of something but I'll assume it's whiskey cocktail.]

Tifa: Well? Most people would say something sweet right about now.

Cloud: I'm sure they would.

Tifa: Ahh, but you're a more discerning customer, aren't you? In which case… Our house special: the Cosmo Canyon.

[This red cocktail looks like Bloody Mary.]

Cloud: Beautiful.

Tifa: I gotta go. Enjoy.

[She goes down to the secret bunker. Jessie enters the base.]

Jessie: Hey! You see the news? “The reactor bombing was the work of the eco extremist group 'Avalanche.'” Public enemy number one! Gets your heart racing, doesn't it?

[She seems very happy about it.]

Jessie: They don't know our faces, so we're in the clear for now, but we'll wanna capitalize on this momentum. Speaking of which, you coming on the next one?

Cloud: For the right price.

Jessie: Oh, you can bet I'll be pushing hard for a raise! Tifa'll be joining us too, but I dunno… Even a blind man can see her heart's not in it. She was never on board with the bombings, so if it comes down to do or die… If I've got to put my life in someone else's hands… Then… I'd rather that someone was a professional. Like you.

[She goes down to the secret bunker. Cloud's playing with the glass.]

Cloud: Could still kill some time. The real deal, huh? What was up with that girl anyway?

[He finishes his cocktail and then walks around the bar, playing darts and looking at signs on the walls. After a while, Tifa comes back.]

Cloud: I heard you're having second thoughts.

Tifa: I know we have to think big if we're going to make a difference. But not like this. I feel trapped.

Cloud: If it feels wrong, don't do it.

[The rest of the group goes upstairs, too.]

Tifa: Guess that's that, then.

Cloud: What, they kick you out?

Tifa: We agreed to disagree. So you want another drink?

Barret: Tifa! Time to celebrate! Break out all the good stuff!

Tifa: Oh. Sure.

Barret: (to Cloud) We won't be needing you for this next job. Feel free to look for work elsewhere.

Cloud: Fine by me. That's how I like it. No contract, no obligation.

[Barret puts an envelope with money on the bar.]

Barret: Figured you'd say that. Here—the rest of your payment, along with a little extra for your exemplary service. And thus concludes our business. And thus concludes our business. Gonna have to ask you to leave now. This here's a private affair.

Jessie: Sorry, I tried. We talked it over, but… in the end… We didn't want to put so much on you. This is our fight.

Biggs: Jessie, what's the holdup?

Jessie: Be right there! No hard feelings, huh?

Cloud: It's fine.

Jessie: Let's talk more after I'm done here, okay?

Cloud: Really, it's fine.

Wedge: C'mon, Jessie! I'm dying here!

Jessie: I'll catch you later. Sorry to keep you thirsty boys waiting!

[They toast the success of the operation by shouting out the name of their terrorist organization.]

Tifa: Don't take this the wrong way, but right now I need to spend time with the gang. Sorry, you were saying?

Barret: When the job's done, we're done. Your words! Okay what were we talking about?

Jessie: We were all pushing real hard for you, you know. So, where'd we leave off?

[Cloud leaves the bar and sees a group of young people.]

Cloud: What's up with them?

Hoodlum: Hey brother! You from around the way?

Cloud: I guess.

Hoodlum: Know a big man with a big gun strapped to his right arm? Heard he's set up shop somewhere in the neighborhood.

Cloud: That depends…

Hoodlum: Clever. Smell an opportunity to make some scratch, do ya?

Cloud: Five hundred.

Hoodlum: Two hundred.

Cloud: Mm, three.

Hoodlum: Whatever, man. Let's find somewhere quiet to talk. Walk with me.

[While they're walking down the street, a young bastard is mocking passers-by.]

Hoodlum: Got something to say!? You lookin' at me? Move it! I said move!

Hoodlum 2: Look at all these assholes starin' at us.

Hoodlum 3: This shithole's got nothing on Wall Market—am I right? Word of advice, blondie. Don't piss off my friend here, or you'll be real sorry.

Hoodlum 2: Unless you've got some kinda death wish then be my guest.

Hoodlum 3: After you, brother… And don't worry backstabbin' type—most days…

[They're going out to the dump.]

Hoodlum: Spill it. You know where the bastard's hiding, don't you?

Cloud: I told you before… That depends.

Hoodlum: Oh yeah? You wasting my time!?

Cloud: Shinra's time, you mean?

Hoodlum: (pulling out a knife) Shinra knows better than to stick its nose in my boss's business.

Cloud: Like I give a shit.

[He pulls out his sword and starts chopping.]

Cloud: Big man with a big gun for an arm, right!?

Hoodlum: Uh… Hey… it's…

Cloud: Why do you want him?

Hoodlum: Just a grunt following orders, you know? Nobody tells me shit. Lemme walk away. Please!

[Cloud kills all the scumbags.]

Cloud: So, if they weren't Shinra, then… Not my problem. Lesson one for life on the ground floor… Get some rest.

[He goes back to his room, which he rents. Next to the faith is Jessie.]

Jessie: Welcome home, honey! Took your sweet time.

[Cloud is freaking out about these words…]

Jessie: Psych. Are you gonna let me in so we can talk in private? Guess I'll get right to the point, then.

[She pulls out a red glowing ball.]

Cloud: What've you got there?

Jessie: An apology. For not getting you on the mission. Or not. What do you think it is?

Cloud: A proposition.

Jessie: Nailed it in one. Gonna have to ask you to keep all this a secret from the others, though. It's a personal matter, something I need to sort out tonight.

Cloud: Tonight?

Jessie: Tonight. You and me, together. I want you to come with me to the Sector 7 plate. I'll give you the details on the way.

Cloud: That's fine by me… But don't you have a pretty big day ahead of you?

Jessie: I do, but… If I don't deal with this now, it's only gonna get harder… Anyway… I can count on you, can't I?

[She throws Cloud the ball. It turns out to be Ifrit.]

Jessie: A down payment. Doubt we'll be back before morning—‘case you were planning on traveling light. Make sure you've got everything you need before we leave. I'll wait here. You all set?

Cloud: Yeah.

Jessie: Awesome. Meet me at the station after dark. Don't be late!

Cloud: It's… just another job…

Chapter 4: Mad Dash
[Evening. Cloud and Jessie approach the station when their old friends on motorcycles suddenly approach them.]

Biggs: Tough break. They changed the times. Last train's already left. Which is why we borrowed these bikes. Need a lift to the plate?

Jessie: How did you guess…?

Wedge: Easy, you've been acting weird. Like, talking about one thing when you're obviously thinking about something else.

Biggs: Yeah, and don't get me started on all that pep.

Jessie: All right, I'll give you that—but how did you know wanted to head topside? Was I talking in my sleep? What else did I say!?

Wedge: No. We just figured you wanted to see your parents. That's all.

Biggs: Nailed it, huh?

Jessie: Yup. Right on the head.

Biggs: So—seeing as we don’t have any family of our own… How about you let us be part of yours for a bit? You know, spread the wealth.

Jessie: Are your parents still around?

Cloud: No.

Jessie: Okay, then. Guess you're all invited! Here's to awkward family reunions!

Biggs & Wedge: Yeah!

Jessie: I take it you boys have your brand-spanking-new IDs?

Biggs & Wedge: Yes, ma'am!

Jessie: Then let's lay down some rubber!

Biggs: Crank that throttle!

Wedge: Okay, you got it!

[They get on motorcycles, start the motors and leave. Cloud and Jessie are on one and Wedge and Biggs are on the other.]

Jessie: You hear me?

Cloud: Yeah.

Jessie: Just so you know, I'm not going plateside for the reason they think I am. Look you saw the way the reactor went up. It was huge, right?

Cloud: Because of all the mako. Isn't that what you said?

Jessie: Yeah… that was wishful thinking. Deep down, I know it was my fault. I used a more powerful fasting agent than the directions called for It had nothing to do with the mako.

Cloud: Let's say you're right. So what?

Jessie: I'm planning on using a weaker blasting agent this time. But… since I can't get in touch with my supplier, our only option is to loot a warehouse owned by Shinra.

Cloud: Shinra? Good luck with that.

Jessie: With your help, we won't need luck. ID scan! Ready!?

Biggs: So far so good!

Jessie: Alright, here comes the hard part!

Biggs: And that is?

Jessie: The fake IDs may have held up, but from this point on, if we get pinged by a scan…

Cloud: They'll come for us.

Jessie: Yeah, what he said.

Biggs: Oh, man!

Wedge: Just like that!?

Jessie: No need to worry. We've got Cloud, remember? Hey, you do know how to drive, right?

Cloud: SOLDIERs get mandatory training.

Jessie: Well then! You gonna take my breath away? Make my head spin with your amazing skills?

Cloud: Don't blame me if ya get sick.

Jessie: Right… We've got company!

Cloud: Someone's having fun.

Jessie: How could I not!? "Pursued by villains, a young couple thrust together by fate race through the neon streaked night…"

Cloud: Get off!

Jessie: Oh! My hero!

Biggs: Straight to lethal force!?

Jessie: What, so you'd just pull over if they asked nicely?

Biggs: Eh… You've got a point.

Jessie: See!? So don't go holding back now!

Jessie: That some super-secret technique? You got a fancy name for it?

Cloud: Of course not.

Biggs: More of ‘em!?

Jessie: Think we've bitten off more than we can chew! Whadda we do!?

Cloud: Shut up!

Mobile Unit Officer: Targets sighted. Moving to intercept.

[Cloud pulls out his giant sword and begins to chop soldiers with it as he races through the tunnel at mad speed.]

Biggs: Got more company!

Cloud: A-team’s here.

Jessie: Uhh, I don't like the sound of that!

Wedge: We're not screwed, are we!?

Jessie: Heads up drones!

Biggs: One thing after another…. C'mon Wedge, gun it!

Wedge: I am gunning it!

Cloud: We're good.

Biggs: Nothing about this is good!

Cloud: You got me.

Biggs: Fair enough! Alright then, do your thing!

[Some guy with long blond hair is gonna watch the chase. He whistles and sends Jessie an air kiss – at least I hope it was for Jessie…]

Mobile Unit Officer: SOLDIER en route. HQ's saying he's less than a few minutes out.

Mobile Unit Officer: Copy.

Mobile Unit Officer: You think it's "him"?

Mobile Unit Officer: Probably. All the more reason to finish this quick. Don't need that kind of trouble.

Biggs: That's an ex-SOLDIER for ya. Next to him, we look like kids on trikes.

Jessie: You're damn right you do!

Biggs: You're part of that "we" too, you know.

Wedge: We made it!

Biggs: Woo-hoo! Topside!

Cloud: Keep going till we hit the station?

Jessie: No, head straight for the warehouse. Our magical ride is almost at an end…

Biggs: Why ya talking like we're not here?

Jessie: Because you're not!

Biggs: Clearly we are! Not over yet!

Cloud:! Little help!?

Mobile Unit Officer: Time's up. Break off before he shows!

Mobile Unit Officer: Copy!

[The same blonde man who was standing on the road appears. He rushes a red car that looks more like a rocket and does a bunch of nonsense tricks trying to show how cool he is.]

Jessie: What's going on? Who's that?

Cloud: A SOLDIER.

???: Well, hello!

Biggs: Who's this!?

??? "Too quick for the eye, you cross him, you die!" Now… Mind if I cut in? Splendid! I've been looking for a new dance partner! Private party, huh? That's fine. I'll settle for a race, then. Just one.

Cloud: You talking to me?

???: I most certainly am.

Cloud: Then no!

???: Ah, so terribly sorry! Your words fail to reach my ears, sluggish and slow as they are!

Jessie: What's this guy's deal!?

???: The lady's curiosity has been piqued! My name is Roche, but you may address me by the more accurate appellation: Speed Demon!

Jessie: Heard that, huh!?

Roche: My ears are attuned to the feminine voice!

Jessie: This guy is the worst.

Roche: Yes. Yes! This is the contest I've been waiting for!

Roche: Fascinating…

Jessie: What is he up to now?

Cloud: Same shit. Being a dumbass.

Roche: Not bad. You have promise, and an abiding affection for your mouth. But! One cannot simply ride one's bike! Nay! One must unlock its true potential and become one with the machine! Like this!

Jessie: You might wanna try using those brakes of yours!

Cloud: Had enough?

Roche: Don't be absurd. As if I could ever grow tired of your company! Naughty, naughty! Until one of our flames is forever extinguished, our dance will never end! Burn for me! Come on! Let's push it past the redline!

Cloud: Jessie, take over.

[He jumps on Roche's motorcycle and cuts his engine, then comes back.]

Roche: Well, well, well! I do believe this round is yours. Maybe next time we can keep it just between the two of us.

Cloud: Maybe.

Roche: Until we meet again, my friend!

Biggs: We did it!

Wedge: Go team!

Jessie: Don't get too excited. Reinforcements are hot on our trail. You failed the test.

Cloud: What test?

Jessie: Driving.

Cloud: I'm great at driving.

Jessie: Hah! Great at scaring your passengers more like…

Cloud: Not used to having any.

Jessie: Maybe you should just let me drive.

Cloud: Nope.

Jessie: Guess I'll take one for the team and be your back warmer again. Aw, would you look at that… It's the end of the ride.

[They drive up to the city and jump off motorcycles.]

Jessie: We'll go on foot from here. Don't wanna draw too much attention to ourselves.

Wedge: Hey, did these things leave a mark?

Biggs: They got you pretty good.

Wedge: Aw…and I'm running on fumes…

Jessie: Don't worry, we'll top you up soon enough. Now let's roll. The residential area's just beyond this gate. Mind doing the honors? You've got an arm on ya! Here we are—the employee housing district. Where they put you when your parents work for Shinra. While their reactors were slowly killing the planet, we were living the good life…

Wedge: C'mere… Aw, no dice… Someone's playing hard to get.

Biggs: Folks here must be living off three or four times what I do.

Jessie: Figures. Still leaves the lights on every night for the girl who only comes home once every other blue moon. Mom's an old-fashioned type like that.

Wedge: Think she'll make us pizza? Her "Midgar Special"?

Biggs: She's quite the cook. Quick to whip up finger-lickin' food even if you drop by in the dead of night.

Jessie: And she loves guests who ask for seconds or thirds. Okay, let's head in. Cloud—you know what to do. Why don't you wait around the corner over there?

Cloud: Ah. Okay.

Wedge: It's a shame you won't get to try the Midgar Special. You would've really liked it.

[Cloud stands around the corner and jets the others. He remembers what Jessie told him.]

Jessie: (in Cloud’s head) With your help, we won't need luck. You'll take on just about any job, right? Well, I need you to rob my house. Think you can do that for me? Go in through the back door when the coast is clear. The signal will be obvious.

Cloud: Once the lights come on, it's go time. Time to go.

[He walks quietly into the house.]

Jessie: (in Cloud’s head) Inside, you'll find a room with two doors. Don't take the one in front of you. You want the room on the right. That's where you'll find it. We'll be chatting Mom up in the kitchen, so don't even bother being quiet. There's no way she'll ever hear you. Dad'll be in there, but it's okay.

[Jessie's Dad's lying on the bed-- it looks like he's in a coma. He's connected to a variety of medical equipment. Apparently, he's got serious health problems.]

Jessie: (in Cloud’s head) I need you to grab his Shinra ID card. And yeah, know I should do it myself, but… but I honestly don't think I'm up to it. Just do this for me, okay?

[Cloud is searching the room for an ID. He finds a letter.]

Cloud: What's this?

Jessie: "Dear Mom and Dad, Sorry for not getting in touch sooner, but… I'm working at the Gold Saucer as an actress now. It wasn't easy, and I had a lot of help from people along the way… but I managed to land a starring role. Enclosed are two tickets to my play. Looking forward to seeing you both there."

Cloud: Jessie Raspberry as… the Princess?

Jessie: (in Cloud’s head) My dad… he was a maintenance supervisor at the reactor.

[Cloud takes the ID out of Jassie’s Dad’s uniform pocket.]

Cloud: (to Jessie’s Dad) Thanks.

[He sees some documents on the desk…]

Cloud: C'mon, there's no time for this.

[He's coming out of the house.]

Cloud: Mission accomplished.

[We're switching to Jessie, who's distracting her mother during the theft. She sits at the dinner table with Wedge and Biggs and lies about her line of work.]

Jessie's Mom: When are you going to give up on the Gold Saucer? How long has it been since you even performed?

Wedge: A lot of people really rely on Jessie.

Jessie's Mom: As a stagehand though, right? You can be one of those anywhere. So why not come home and get a job at the Sector 8 theater?

Jessie: Uhhh, I'll think about it. You know, I'd really love to stay and chat, but we gotta go.

Jessie's Mom: So soon!

Jessie: Yeah, well, we hadn't even planned on dropping by. But Wedge wanted some of your famous pizza.

Wedge: (eating) So good!

Jessie's Mom: Sure I can't tempt you with some more?

Wedge: Maybe just a couple slices, Missus R.

Biggs: & Jessie: Wedge!

Wedge: Hey! I'm… I'm doing it for you guys! You don't want me going to work on an empty stomach.

Jessie: (in Cloud’s head) I'm planning on using a weaker blasting agent this time. Since I can't get in touch with my supplier, our only option is to loot a warehouse owned by Shinra.

[Jesse, Wedge and Biggs leave the house and go outside.]

Jessie: Hey there.

Cloud: This it?

Jessie: Now comes the hard part. I'm gonna use this to sneak into the 7-6 Annex.

Biggs: All right, let's get to it.

Jessie: Sorry, but you're staying outside. Only I know what to steal from where, so it's gotta be me who goes in.

Biggs: So… we came all this way just to eat pizza!?

Jessie: You think I'd let you off that easy? You're gonna earn every slice helping Cloud, Just do the thing where you draw everyone's attention away, like you did at my parents'. What's the word again? Maybe I'm more nervous than I thought.

Cloud: Diversion.

Jessie: Yeah, that! Nice one, military man.

Wedge: So what does this mean we're gonna ask some Shinra folks out to dinner?

Biggs: You know damn well what she means. While you're inside, we make sure the guards are focused on the outside. Yeah?

Jessie: Exactly. Couldn't've put it any better. When you see a flare go up, that's your cue. Rush the front gates and make for the warehouse plaza. The more hell you raise, the more time you buy me.

Biggs: You're gonna run this guy into the ground, aren'tcha? How much time do you think you’ll need?

Cloud: How much time do you think you'll need?

Jessie: Not too much. I'll be in and out. I'll send up another flare when I'm done. We rendezvous in the vacant lot up ahead.

Biggs: Hold on. How are we supposed to get back to the slums? Wait for the first train?

Jessie: No, I wanna be back before that. Don't worry, I have something worked out. Now, let's get this done.

Biggs: Well, that diversion's not gonna create itself. Jessie's dad was in there, right?

Cloud: Yeah.

Biggs: Mako poisoning. Happened while Jessie was doing a show at the Gold Saucer Ah, but what do you care?

Cloud: No, I wanna hear it.

Biggs: Jessie always wanted to be an actress. Worked her ass off for years until finally she caught a break. Top billing. Parents were thrilled. And then… right before opening night…

Wedge: Her dad had an accident.

Biggs: Collapsed from overwork… and in the worst possible, place. Mako storage. Lay there half a day before someone found him. Been like that ever since. No change whatsoever. That's what got her into planetology, and led her to seek out Avalanche. How far we've come…

Wedge: Jessie's got a theory about it. Thinks her dad's spirit is stuck now—between his body and the heart of the planet. So if we don't shut down the reactors soon….

Biggs: He'll get caught up in the flow and… poof. What's so funny?

Cloud: Just that I understand how you feel. Unlike most of the time.

Biggs: I see… Mako's the essence of life itself. Of memory and hope. It's not something you burn in a reactor just to keep the lights on. Hell no. Oh—don't tell Jessie about this little chat, okay? When she gets pissed, she gets punchy.

Cloud: Well… No promises.

Wedge: He's serious, Cloud! She'll beat the shit out of us!

Cloud: Not my problem.

Biggs: This guy!

Wedge: Hey! It's the lot Jessie was talking about. We rendezvous here when we've got what we came for.

Biggs: Gotta stay hidden—wait for the signal.

Wedge: It's so quiet…

Biggs: Just need to get past this gate.

Cloud: Wait. Where are the guards?

[The security guard at the checkpoint is lying dead on the floor of his workplace.]

Biggs: Looks like someone beat us here.

Wedge: And I don't think it was Jessie.

Biggs: This had better not get in the way of our plans…

Cloud: It won't.

Biggs: Don't see anyone. What the hell happened?

Wedge: Hey, man, the plaza's that way. Warehouses are further in. Jessie's supposed to be circling around from the back, right…?

Biggs: No need for us to rush. Let's scout it out first.

Cloud: I can handle this solo.

Biggs: What, you're trying to keep us out of it now? Don't be a jackass.

Wedge: We're in this together!

Cloud: Don't expect me to save you.

Biggs: If you need to check your gear, now's the time. Give the word when you're good to go.

Wedge: You can use that vending machine over there to stock up!

Biggs: Guess there's a training center too. Could go a few rounds before the main event.

Wedge: Man! I get really hungry when I'm nervous! When you leave something at home, or just need a bite to eat, vending machines can be real lifesavers!

Biggs: Remind me—you've got summoning materia, don't you? There's no better way to deal with big groups. You'd be crazy not to equip it. Hope I've got everything I need myself… Gun, spare mags. Other than that… uh…

Wedge: Whenever you're ready, just let us know, Cloud!

Biggs: So. Ya all set? Okay. Let's go over the plan one last time. You start things off by cutting loose where everyone can see you.

Wedge: And us?

Biggs: We're the backup.

Biggs: First, we climb high enough to get a vantage point—

[Cloud sees something and remembers his past.]

Tifa: Heya. So… what did you wanna talk about?

Cloud: When spring comes, I'm leaving town and going to Midgar.

Tifa: Should've figured. All the guys are leaving.

Cloud: B-but I'm not like them. I'm not going just to look for work. I'm gonna be a SOLDIER. The best of the best. Like Sephiroth.

Tifa: The great war hero, huh? Mm… Isn't it pretty hard to become a SOLDIER?

Cloud: Yeah. So I won't be back for a long time.

Tifa: Guess not. Think you'll be in the papers? Just… promise me one thing. When we're older, and you're a famous SOLDIER… if I'm ever trapped or in trouble… Promise you'll come and save me.

Cloud: Huh?

Tifa: That's what heroes do. They save people. Please? Just once. Come on, promise me!

Cloud: Fine. I promise.

[After that, he remembers a recent conversation with Tifa at the bar.]

Cloud: I heard you're having second thoughts.

Tifa: I know we have to think big if we're going to make a difference… but not like this. I feel trapped.

[Cloud clenches his fist and wakes up. He sees a firework in the air.]

Wedge: That's the signal!

Biggs: All according to plan.

Cloud: Let's go.

Biggs: Right!

Security Officer: I don't see any intruders. Maybe they went home. Hey! Over there! T-target sighted! Light him up!

[Cloud takes off his giant sword and the battle begins.]

Cloud: Give up?

Security Officer: K-kill the bastard!

Security Officer: They're up there too! We've spotted more intruders. Send backup.

Security Officer: Dammit! There's just too many of them!

Biggs: Oh, you gotta be shitting me. Gimme a bit more time and I got you.

Security Officer: Give it up!

Biggs: Goodbye! And good riddance.

Elite Shock Trooper: Don't let them escape!

Wedge: And down she goes!

Biggs: Look at us amateurs putting in the work.

[However, their joy was short-lived - a special enclosure opens in the building and several vicious dogs run out of there. Cloud's getting ready to fight.]

Wedge: Don't worry—I've got this! Catch me if you caaan! Tasty treats! Come and get 'em! Think I ran off the pizza… 

Biggs: Helluva show, man! If only the ladies loved you that much! 

Wedge: I'm glad someone's enjoying themselves…

[After the heroes defeat the dogs, a barrel-shaped combat robots gets in their way - just like at the beginning of the game.]

Biggs: Of course they store mechs here… 

Cloud: You ready? 

Biggs: Hell yeah! 

Wedge: More than you know! Look what I found. Let's give these jerks a taste of their own medicine! 

[Two bombs appear in his hands. During the battle, Cloud uses a special technique to call Wedge.]

Wedge: I laid a few more mines for ya! There still some left, you know! You should make use of them while you can! Now that's what I call teamwork!

[While the heroes defeated the robots, they were armed with the military. There's nowhere to run.]

Security Officer: Stay where you are! 

Biggs: Well, shit. 

Security Officer: All right, assholes! Show me your hands!

[Suddenly, a red bike with Roche on it is flying out of the top. He laughs madly and disperse the military.]

Roche: Well, aren't we having a wonderful time kicking the hornet's nest! 

[He gets off his motorcycle and takes out his medieval sword.]

Roche: You know what I want. A second dance—just the two of us. You turned the key… The engine roars with excitement… (touches his heart) It hungers to be set free! 

[Cloud pulls out his cleaver.]

Cloud: Fall back. 

Biggs: Right. C'mon! 

Roche: It's been a long time since I fought a duel out of the saddle. But… for all the miles on the clock… I'm just as fast as I ever was! 

[Roche throws a cure at Cloud, restoring maximum health and attacks.]

Roche: I told you we were gonna push it past the redline!

[Cloud wins.]

Cloud: Satisfied? 

Roche: With such fleeting pleasure? Hardly. There are higher heights to which you and I can still soar… 

Security Officer: Okay, boys! Give 'em everything you've got! But kill the swordsman first! 

[The heroes are surrounded by soldiers and robots. They are preparing to defend themselves, but Roche destroys half of the military with his motorcycle.]

Roche: We really must do this again. Until then… try not to die. I'll see you on the road, my friend. 

[He laughs madly and leaves.]

Cloud: Goddammit! Let's go! 

Wedge: Run! Run while you can!

[It falls on the asphalt. The heroes are approached by another group of soldiers.]

Trooper: Friendly! Friendly! Stand down! Your team shouldn't be here. 

Wedge: Glad yours is… 

Biggs: C'mere. Wedge'll be fine. But you won't be if they start asking questions. 

Cloud: And who are "they"? 

Biggs: First guests to the party. Another Avalanche cell. Our holier-than-thou friends from the old guard… It's always their way or the highway. Lately they've been a real pain in the ass… Till now. 

Cloud: So then why are they here? 

Biggs: Beats me. We've been on the outs ever since our cell got labeled too extreme… though they're the ones running around with mil-spec gear. Word is they've cut a deal with Wutai… Promised 'em all the materia in Midgar, apparently. Think there's any truth to that? 

Cloud: You tell me. 

Biggs: Sometimes I think we're the only ones who've realized, the war is over. Okay mission complete. Let's make our way back to the lot. 

Cloud: Right. 

Biggs: Looking a lot more crowded now. 

Cloud: Security's out in force. 

Biggs: Just what we need. 

Cloud: So, are we not gonna wait for Wedge? 

Biggs: If we stuck around or went back, he'd only get upset. 

Cloud: Why's that? 

Biggs: Guess a SOLDIER wouldn't understand… 

Biggs: I'll tell him you were worried about him, though. Who knows-might just make his day. 

Jessie: You made it! Over here! Could you have been any louder? I mean, it made my job a lot easier, but— Wait, where's Wedge? Wedge!? That was close… 

Cloud: We'll go get him. 

Biggs: Hey, buddy. How you doing? C'mon… 

Wedge: Not my finest hour… 

Biggs: You get hit? 

Wedge: Just winged, I think… Or shot! 

Biggs: Really? Let me see… 

Jessie: Are we seriously doing this here? That's… wow. 

Wedge: You guys are the worst… 

Jessie: Your ass is fine. Maybe singed, but the only casualty is your underwear. This is like a bruise or a mild burn at worst!

[She slaps his ass.]

Wedge: Now that was a gunshot. 

Jessie: Is that a smile I spy? 

Cloud: It's not safe here. We should go. 

Biggs, Jessie, & Wedge: Copy that! 

Wedge: So how do we get back to the slums? 

Jessie: With a little trick I've been dying to try out… 

Biggs: Man, can't believe HQ was running an op tonight of all nights. 

Cloud: Coincidence? 

Biggs: That or a bad omen. If they're ramping up for something, could get messy. Add it to the pile of complications to think about. 

Jessie: Right, this is it! Through here and we're home free.

Wedge: Where exactly are we going? 

Jessie: When we get there, you'll know! Now that I've got my blasting agent, we should have everything we need for our next mission! 

Biggs: Sure hope so. 

Cloud: Yeah… m-me too. For your dad's sake.

Biggs: Hey! What the hell, man!? 

Jessie: Huh? 

Wedge: Uh—Cloud was just saying how he hopes to come back and try the Midgar Special next time! 

Jessie: Really, huh? Cloud said that? 

Biggs: Sure did! Wants a whole pie to himself, isn't that right? 

Cloud: That's… that's right… 

Jessie: Really…? Well, okay then! Maybe I'll lend Mom a hand next time too! 

Wedge: That'd be awesome! 

Biggs: Super-duper awesome! 

Jessie: Should be somewhere around here… Bingo! I half figured my dad got it wrong, but nope! They're here just like he said! 

Biggs: Parachutes? 

Wedge: Huh? Whaddya mean "half figured"!? 

Jessie: Fifty-fifty is pretty good odds, if you ask me! This is gonna be fun! Thanks guys. I really appreciate you coming all this way with me And like I said before, I'd be grateful if you kept this between us until after the mission. I don't wanna… complicate things.

[They stand on an iron pipe, about to jump into the lower town.]

Biggs: Sure. Okay, who's ready to fly!? 

Jessie: Me! Me! 

Biggs: Hey Cloud you let him down gently, alright? 

Cloud: Yep. 

Jessie: Wait, I almost forgot! One more thing! 

Biggs: S-stop it! What in the hell are you trying to—

Jessie: Easy! You'll make us fall! 

Biggs: Not if you do first! 

Jessie: Swing by my place after—so I can "pay you in full." 

Biggs: Huh!? Now!?

[She jumps.]

Wedge: Wait! Gimme a minute! 

Cloud: No. 

Wedge: Why do you have to be such a hard-ass, bro? 

Cloud: I ain't your bro.

[He jumps too. Wedge yells, but as soon as the chute opens, he starts to like flying. He grabs his ass.]

Wedge: I wish I could've done more… Just got hurt—

Cloud: You did enough. You took one for the team. Be proud. 

Wedge: Yeah…? Yeah…

Biggs: Feels like we're flying high these days! 

Jessie: Now more than ever! 

Biggs: He's a keeper all right. 

Jessie: Yeah! Together we can take on the world!

[They're landing in the slums.]

Wedge: I'll head home on my own. After all, I'm only a little sore… 

Cloud: It's cool, we'll go together. 

Wedge: Aw, thanks, bro! 

Cloud: Cut that out. 

Wedge: This way! Think Jessie and Biggs made it back safe? 

Cloud: I guess. 

Wedge: Cool if we check on them? We'll pass by their places anyway. 

Cloud: Sure. 

Katie: It's you! You're the merc everybody's talking about, am I right? 

Cloud: Yeah. 

Katie: I knew it! So the board here tracks how many monsters folks've taken down, right? A bigger number means a safer town and who wouldn't want that? Just between you and me, though they're pretty much all your kills. Cool, huh? Anyway, keep up the good work! We'll try to make it worth your while. Whoa, check it out! I don't think the number's ever gone that high before! At this rate, we won't have to worry about monsters ever again! What a thing to be able to say… Thank you so, so much! We'll never forget how many bloodthirsty beasts you kept off our streets! Ahhh, smell that fresh air! That's the smell of a safe e and happy town-one you can be proud to call home! Hey there! How's it going? I don't think anyone's ever gonna beat that record of yours! It's incredible! 

Weapons Vendor: Got customers lining up around the block to get their hands on big ol' swords like yours. 

Wedge: Well, this is Biggs's place. I guess he hasn't made it home yet. 

Cloud: Guess not. 

Wedge: Hope he isn't "worst case-ing" it again. He's got a habit of overthinking things. Worrying about all the possible outcomes till his head hurts.

Cloud: Wouldn't've guessed.

Wedge: And when he worries, I worry. Anyway, let's head on over to Jessie's! C'mon, bro! Let's get going! This is where Jessie lives. Men are not allowed inside. 

Cloud: Hmm…

Wedge: Lots of pretty girls trying to make it big onstage live here. So don't hang around or they might get the wrong idea. 

Cloud: Huh. 

Wedge: I'm telling you this for your own good, Cloud! People around here love to gossip 

Cloud: They know about Jessie and Avalanche? 

Wedge: Nah, it's all good. They think she's an actress. Oh… and one more thing, bro. It's all a game to her. Don't fall for it! 

Cloud: You lost me. 

Wedge: Life's a stage and love's the play! Guys aren't allowed, remember!? Hey there, Biggums, Reggie, Smalls… Brought a new friend to meet you! These little guys are on guard duty today.

Cloud: Okay… 

Wedge: Thanks for seeing me home! 

Cloud: Really sorry about your ass. 

Wedge: S'all good, bro! 

Cloud: It's kinda weird when you call me th— 

Wedge: Hey, don't be scared! Deep down, he's a big softie. 

Cloud: Hell with it…

Wedge: Hey, bro! Wanna chill with me and the gang for a bit? 

Cloud: Uh, who's the gang? 

Wedge: The cats, dummy. Who else? Biggumus Rex, Reginaldo, Mister Smalls… 

Cloud: Right…

[Cloud leaves and goes home to Jessie for his reward.]

Jessie: Well, if it isn't Cloud Strife! Was wondering when you’d show up. Without further ado… Here you are. 

[She give him… materia.]

Jessie: Thanks for stepping up, "merc." And now for the cherry on top.

[She hugs him tightly. That's so cute.]

Cloud: Okay, I get it. Mind letting me breathe? 

Jessie: Depends. Mind coming over tomorrow night? My roommates should all be out for a while. 

Cloud: Are you seriously that desperate? Just let go already. 

Jessie: Only if you promise to come back tomorrow night. Deal?

Cloud: No promises, but I'll think it over. 

Jessie: Really? You will!? I make a mean pizza, I'll have you know! Marche, luche, black milly, red shelly—I use only the best ingredients! Sound good? 

Cloud: Never heard of any of that stuff. 

Jessie: Awww, you are so adorable, you know that!? You just leave everything to me it'll be great! Nighty night! Psych!

[She closes the door, and Cloud stays outside. ]

Cloud: Bad idea… 

[He goes to his room. On the way, he thinks of going to Tifa's…]

Cloud: She's probably asleep. 

[He takes off his sword and goes to rest. After a while, someone knocks at his room.]

Tifa: Cloud? 

Cloud: Yeah. 

Tifa: You were out for a while. 

Cloud: Just walking. 

Tifa: I ran into Johnny, by the way. Said not to worry, he was getting out of town. 

Cloud: Oh, that guy. 

Tifa: You… weren't thinking of leaving Midgar anytime soon, were you? 

Cloud: Well, seems this old friend of mine's in a tight spot… Long time ago I said I'd be there for her. Made a promise, so… 

Tifa: Can't say this is quite what I had in mind when I put that on you way back when. 

Cloud: If you wanna talk, I'm listening. 

Tifa: Huh? What's with you all of a sudden? 

Cloud: With me? 

Tifa: Like you're losing that hard edge. 

Cloud: That bad?

Tifa: Not at all—I like it. Maybe Marlene won't be so scared of you next time… I'm really glad to have you back, Cloud. Really glad. 

Tifa: It's pretty late, huh? I'd like to catch up more, but we should probably both get some sleep, yeah? 

Cloud: Yeah. 

Tifa: Good night then. 

Cloud: Good night, Tifa…

[Tifa leaves and Cloud falls asleep. At night, ethereal spirits come to him.]

???: Sleep. And dream the sweetest dreams…

[Tifa runs into the room.]

Tifa: Cloud! 

Cloud: What's wrong? 

Tifa: Come with me! Quickly! 

[He goes out into the street and sees that the whole city is filled with perfume. It's visible now.]

Tifa: We were getting ready to set out when those things showed up and came after us! We were getting ready to set out when those things showed up and came after us! 

Cloud: The others? 

Tifa: Barret and Jessie are holding their ground, but for how long I don't know… 

Cloud: Let's go. 

Tifa: Right. 

Cloud: Ready? 

Tifa: You know it!

[They engage in a fierce battle with an enemy that far outnumbers them.]

Cloud: Let's head for the bar. 

Tifa: Okay! 

Cloud: Is this even working? We kill it? 

Tifa: Man… I really hope we did.

Cloud: This is stupid. There's no end to this. 

Tifa: What are these things? 

Cloud: No idea. Pretty sure you can't even see them unless they make physical contact first… 

Tifa: And that's all you can tell me? 

Cloud: I can tell you they're not invincible. 

Tifa: I guess that's something. More of them!? 

Cloud: We're running out of time. 

Tifa: Yeah-over here! 

Cloud: Again? 

Tifa: Are they trying to stop us from reaching the others? 

Tifa: Cloud. This way. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. It's like trying to fight a hurricane. 

Cloud: Stay on your feet. 

Tifa: You don't have to tell me that. 

[They're coming up to the bar. On his doorstep, Jessie and Barret fight off the spirits with machine guns. Barret falls.]

Jessie: Barret!

Barret: Gimme a break! 

Tifa: Jessie! Barret! 

Barret: Where you been!? 

Jessie: They just keep coming! We've gotta do something! 

Tifa: Hang on! Cloud:! 

Cloud: I'm coming! Move! 

Tifa: What is it doing now? Something weird is going on. 

Barret: How's your ammo? 

Jessie: Running low— Shit! 

Tifa: Jessie! 

Barret: Dammit!

[Suddenly the spirits that are almost victorious are flying away.]

Tifa: Huh? 

Cloud: The hell…? 

Barret: Jessie! 

Tifa: You okay? 

Jessie: Me and my two left feet… 

Tifa: Easy now! 

Barret: We ain't putting on a damn show! The hell were those things? Some kind of… I dunno! Guess I shouldn't be surprised, though. Never can tell what weird shit'll come crawling out of the scrap down here. It's those reactors, I'm telling you… 

Cloud: It hurt? 

Jessie: Wish I could say it didn't, but yeah… God, this is so embarrassing… Hate playing the damsel in distress…

[Cloud takes her in his arms and carries her to the bar.]

Cloud: It happens. 

Wedge: What did you do to your leg!? D-does it hurt? 

Jessie: Not nearly as much as the fuss everyone's making. 

Tifa: Still, I think you ought to avoid putting any—

[Jessie trips.]

Barret: That's enough! You're out, Jessie. 

Jessie: Huh? What about the mission? We already sent Biggs in, remember? Don't tell me you're thinking of calling it off!? 

Barret: Nah, we got this… 

Jessie: The hell you do! 

Wedge: If you need someone to step up, I'm your man! (coughs)

Barret: Okay… So here's the thing…

Cloud: I'm gonna need a raise. 

Barret: Consider it done! 

Barret: Alright, everyone—Cloud's in. The mission is on! 

Jessie: Go and raise some hell for me, okay? 

Barret: Listen, Wedge—I need you to hang back and guard the home front.

Wedge: But I’m in perfect health!

Barret: Which makes you the perfect choice to look after Jessie and Marlene. Let's get this show on the road… to Mako Reactor 5! Once you've got your gear in order, head to the station for the meet. Got it? This'll help you get squared away. Don't tell me I never did nothing for ya. 

[500 gil obtained. Epic.]

Barret: I'm counting on you, SOLDIER boy…

[He leaves the bar.]

Jessie: Relegated to stagehand once again. I'm starting to think I'll never have a starring role… 

Cloud: There's always next time. 

Jessie: What's this? Words of encouragement? Thanks, I need them. 

Wedge: With old Wedge in charge, this place'll be safer than ever! Good luck out there, bro. And take care. 

Jessie: Hurry back now. You don't want my home-cooked pizza to get cold. 

Tifa: Alright, let's get going. 

Cloud: Sure… after you take a deep breath.

Tifa: Huh? 

Cloud: I can tell you're nervous. 

Tifa: That obvious, huh? Okay. I'm ready now. 

Chadley: Cloud. You have exceeded my expectations. I hope you will continue to help me gather vital information for my research. I look forward to receiving all of your future battle intel submissions. 

Barret: Alright, people. Mission starts the moment we board that train. You sure you ready for this? 

[They go to the train station and wait for the train.]

Tifa: Do you think Biggs is… on schedule? 

Barret: All we can do is hope… 

Cloud: Today really gotta be the day, huh? 

Barret: Ain't no stopping this train we're on, son. A lotta people risked their lives to get it rolling… Already put the word out more's coming, too… "Shut them all down by today, or we shut another down for you." Ain't on us. Not us… 

[The train comes. A few soldiers comes out of its car.]

Barret: Play it cool.

[The terrorists are entering the train.]

Chapter 5: Dogged Pursuit
Announcement: This is an announcement from the Shinra Electric Power Company. The terrorist group "Avalanche" has issued another bomb threat. In response, we have raised the threat level and entered a state of heightened alert. All lines are currently experiencing delays. We anticipate that our arrival in Sector 4 will be later than scheduled. 

Barret: The target's Mako Reactor 5. From the station, we take the backstreets. Once we're inside the facility, it's the same deal as last time. 

Cloud: Head for mako storage. 

Barret: And then blow it all to hell. Let's do this one for Jessie and Wedge. They deserve it.

Tifa: Yeah. 

Cloud: Sure. 

Tifa: I didn't think word would spread this fast. There's barely anyone on this train. And none of them look happy to be here. 

Barret: Might stand out as a group. You two stay here. 

Tifa: Cloud. 

Announcement: The train will be passing an ID checkpoint shortly. 

Tifa: Here comes the first hurdle… 

Cloud: Not much of one. 

Tifa: I know, I know. But that doesn't mean I don't have butterflies in my stomach. Hey, would you mind keeping an eye on things the next car over? I'm worried there might be trouble. 

Cloud: Why's that? 

Tifa: Barret's always on edge before missions, but you 'know he's a good guy underneath it all. The people on this train don't. 

Cloud: He'll be fine. 

Tifa: Maybe… but I won't be until I know for sure. 

Cloud: (sighs) Be right back. 

Tifa: Thanks.

[Cloud goes to the next car where Barrett talks to Shinra's employee.]

Shinra Middle Manager: So do you still support those terrorists? Avalanche is a blight on Midgar. Their bomb threat has thrown our offices into chaos, let alone the reactor itself. It's total insanity! But we won't lose heart! No! Everyone at Shinra agrees. The reactor will stay online! 

Barret: Heh. Is that right? 

Shinra Middle Manager: What? You got a problem with that? 

Barret: Do I have a problem with that? Oh, you can bet—

[Cloud stops the idiot.]

Cloud: He doesn't. 

Barret: Hmph. Asshole… 

Cloud: You know you're better than that.

[Barret murmuring classical Final Fantasy victory tune.]

Barret: Why don't you go check on Tifa? Quit screwing around here. 

Announcement: Emergency ID scan in progress. 

Tifa: No way! 

Announcement: Emergency ID scan in progress. Unauthorized IDs detected. Threat level: critical. Inspection and containment sweep initiated, commencing at the rear of the train. 

Tifa: Not good! 

Barret: Get over here. Now!

[Security drones gets into the car, breaking through windows.]

Passenger: What the hell!? 

Tifa: Take care of them, Cloud! 

Cloud: On it. 

Announcement: Lockdown protocol initiated. This train car will enter lockdown in three minutes. Lockdown protocol initiated. This train car will enter lockdown shortly. 

Tifa: Please! You have to get out of here! 

Shinra Middle Manager: Wh-what are you doing!? 

Tifa: Trying to keep you alive. 

Shinra Middle Manager: But I work for Shinra. I'm the enemy. 

Tifa: I don't care. I don't want anyone to die. Please! 

Shinra Middle Manager: I'll look after the others.

[She closes the car door and turns to the drones.]

Tifa: My turn!

Cloud: There's no end to them. 

Announcement: Three unauthorized passengers successfully contained. Neutralizing threat. 

Barret: Looks like you're right, SOLDIER boy. 

Cloud: Screw this.

Barret: Huh? 

Cloud: The station will be crawling with security. We gotta jump. 

Barret: Screw that! 

Cloud: Need to slow the train down. 

Barret: Sounds like a Biggs plan E. Okay, y'all watch and learn. I'm gonna jump. Gonna do it. Gonna show you how it's done!

[They jump off the train.]

Cloud: Tifa! You okay? 

Tifa: Yeah…

[But drones doesn’t even think to let them go.]

Cloud: Alright, you ready? 

Tifa: Ready. 

Tifa: That's gotta be him! Hey, thanks. For when we jumped from the train, mean. 

Cloud: No biggie. You're pretty light, you know. 

Tifa: You always know what to say.

[Meanwhile, our terrorists are being watched through cameras…]

Heidegger: Well done, well done! I felt sure we had them, didn't you? 

Subordinate: Sir! 

Heidegger: Born survivors, these sewer rats. Speaking of which, where is the third? 

Subordinate: In custody, sir. 

Heidegger: Return it to the wild.

Subordinate: Yessir! Right away! 

Security Officer: It's them! 

Security Officer: We have a visual on the targets! Requesting immediate assistance! 

Tifa: He's close! Come on! There! 

Tifa: Barret! 

Barret: Tifa! Could use some help here! 

Tifa: We're coming! 

Barret: Make it quick! should be some stairs over there! 

Tifa: We'd better hurry. 

Cloud: Yeah. 

Barret: I've had it up to here with you damn robo-bugs! I'm gonna rip off those spindly legs of yours one by one! I ain't going down without a fight! 

Tifa: That doesn't sound good! 

Cloud: Let's go. 

Tifa: Barret! 

Barret: Great! Gimme a hand! 

Grenadier: Confirmed! It's the three who jumped from the train! Don't let any of them escape! 

Barret: This calls for a song! Duhn-duhn-duhn-duhn, duhn, duhn, duhn-da-duhn! 

Tifa: That's gotta be the last of them… right? 

Barret: Aw, who cares? We can take 'em! Now let's confirm our position and get back on mission! That reactor's waiting! Looks like it's gonna be plan E. 

Cloud: Go on. 

Barret: Plan A was if everything went off without a hitch. From the station, it would've been a straight shot to the reactor. Didn't work out, but we knew going in we had to have alternatives. Backup plans 'case we had to get off early. From closer in to further out—B, C, D, and so on. 

Cloud: Up to what? 

Tifa: …To E.

Cloud: Lucky us… 

Barret: (laughs) You're damn right! 

Tifa: Anyway, we were riding the train between Sector 4 and the main pillar when we had to bail out. 

Tifa: And we ended up on the adjacent line, which should take us to Reactor 5.

Barret: That’s right. So for now we follow the tracks. Not too far though. Need to switch to a different route before we hit the station. 'Cause you can bet your ass it's gonna be crawling with security—all on high alert. 

Tifa: Let's move. 

Barret: Our friends in Sector 5 marked the route, so don't worry about getting lost. It's a straight shot to victory, people! All we gotta do… is take it! 

[Meanwhile, Heidegger is on the phone in his office. He's watching the terrorists through cameras.]

Heidegger: You have nothing to worry about, sir. Preparations for the grand finale are proceeding without incident. I have the utmost confidence that everything will play out as you intended… Yes, of course. I will not fail you, sir. 

Subordinate: Sir. Analytics reports that the results fall within the admissible range. However, the casualty rate significantly exceeds previous proje—

Heidegger: Remind me what your job is. Is it to question the wisdom of your superiors and bemoan your personal, hardships? 

Subordinate: Sir? 

Heidegger: Casualty rate? You think I care about the casualty rate? They are pawns in a greater game. If your stock runs low, then go round up more from Sector 3 or wherever else. Use your head and bring me solutions instead of problems for a change, yes? 

Subordinate: Sir! 

Heidegger: It is so hard to find good help these days. Which is why the president ought to count his blessings. What would he do without me? (laughs)

[We’re back to Cloud and the gang.]

Barret: When the time comes, remember: we just gotta follow the nose. 

Cloud: What? 

Tifa: Stamp's nose. 

Barret: We look for graffiti, then head in whichever direction its nose points. But pay attention to railway signals too. You see blue lights, you're going the right way. Follow the blue lights and we'll reach the reactor. 

Barret: You gotta check the signals, son. The signals! Biggs is way ahead of us. Jessie was gonna back him up, so it wouldn't surprise me if he needs our help. So let's not keep him waiting, 

Tifa: Right. 

Elite Grenadier: You're not going anywhere! 

Barret: There's one. In nose we trust. 

Tifa: Good thing our colleagues put up all that Stamp graffiti. Without it, we'd be lost for sure. What's that? 

Barret: Nothing good. 

Tifa: Guys… I think it might be a nest! 

Barret: All kinds of creepy-crawlies make themselves at home, in the plate, then get messed up even more by the mako.

Tifa: Mako did this?

Barret: No. Not mako. Shinra. What?

Cloud: That black-and-white world of yours. 

Barret: Ya like it, huh? You know there's room for one more.

Cloud: I’ll think about it. 

Tifa: More of 'em!? 

Barret: What is this? A science experiment!? What now!? So you must be the queen, huh!? I ain't no exterminator. Why I gotta kill all these nasty ass bugs? 

Tifa: Those things really creep me out. 

Barret: A train's gonna get derailed by 'em one of these days. 

Tifa: Shinra should do something. 

Barret: After an accident they will. 

Tifa: When it's too late then. 

Barret: There's good ol' Stamp. Check his nose.

Tifa: This isn't bad, y'know…

Barret: Yeah, they really captured the essence of corporate propaganda. 

Tifa: Check it out. I guess Shinra's doing something about those monsters after all. 

Barret: Doing a half-assed job looks like. 

Security Officer: How did you get in here! 

Security Officer: It's those three terrorists from the train! 

Barret: Alright. Let's figure out where the hell we are. There's an old rail yard not far from here. What we're looking for's somewhere inside. 

Cloud: And that is…? 

Barret: A secret passageway. 

[We're switching back to Heidegger's office.]

Subordinate: We've compiled our report on Avalanche's combat capabilities and are—

Heidegger: Report, report, report! What good do you think a damn report will do anyone!? 

Subordinate: I don't… 

Heidegger: Have you already forgotten the war with Wutai? An enemy spared is an enemy who will repay your "kindness" with blood. We must crush them—thoroughly and completely, without hesitation or mercy! Shinra cannot and will not settle for anything less. Will you!? 

Subordinate: But… but sir—

Heidegger: If so… I can only assume that you and your men no longer wish to serve in your current positions. Is that correct? 

Subordinate: We'll prepare the prototype in Section E for immediate deployment. Right now, dammit! 

Heidegger: Another day, another victory! How do I do it!? (laughs)

[We switch back to our terrorists.]

Barret: Gotta love the irony of Shinra's smarmy lapdog, leading the way to its master's destruction.

Security Officer: Intruders! 

Tifa: You really don't like Stamp, do you, Barret.

Barret: It's not that I hate him. I hate the fact Shinra took a loyal animal like that and Co-Opted it for their own self-serving agenda. 

Tifa: Poor old Stamp. Think you're making progress and then you hit a wall. 

Cloud: Knock it down. 

Tifa: You're starting to sound like Barret. 

Cloud: Never mind. 

Barret: It's a good plan! Hey! Hold up! This way. 

Tifa: Security is a lot tighter than I thought it would be. 

Barret: If they wanna stand between us and the rail yard, that's their choice.

Flametrooper: Get 'em! You bastards aren't going to get away this time! 

Barret: No getting through that gate! Let's take the stairs. We should be reaching that secret passage real soon. knew plan E wouldn't fail us. Should called it "plan excellent"! Whatcha think, Mister Ex-SOLDIER? 

Cloud: Biggs made the plan right? 

Barret: I provided some input. 

Cloud: Hope not too much. 

Barret: What's that s posed to mean? 

Tifa: Thought this place was abandoned. 

Barret: Guess not. 

Elite Security: Officer Give it up, assholes, or we'll blow you to hell! Surrender! 

Tifa: So many guards. 

Barret: Too many…

Barret: Keep looking for faithful little Stamp. He'll lead us to the passageway. 

[They find a big, ancient robot.]

Cloud: This it? Get back! 

Tifa: What the—!? 

Barret: That all you got!? 

Cloud: Someone's mad. 

Barret: Take your best shot, asshole! 

Cloud: Huh. Looks like an old model.

Barret: So, it's an antique. 

Cloud: Don't underestimate it. It's slow, but it hits hard. 

Barret: The hell!? Tough bastard. 

Tifa: What do we do? 

Cloud: Aim for its legs. Bring it down. Tifa! Watch out! 

Tifa: Right! I'll distract it. You two keep doing your thing. Hey, see that? 

Cloud: That's its heart—a mako generator. 

Barret: I'm guessin' we aim for that! 

Tifa: What are those? 

Cloud: More drones. 

Barret: This is where I shine! 

Tifa: Get out of our way! 

Barret: Damn! Think we gotta take these down first. That's how it's done! 

Cloud: Now let's finish it. 

Barret: That it!? 

Tifa: Now what? 

Cloud: Could be a system error. 

Barret: Thing's probably busted! 

Barret: What's it doing now? 

Tifa: I think 

Cloud: Get away from the tracks! 

Barret: Don't wanna get caught by that shit! Shit!'It's still going! 

Tifa: Now what? 

Cloud: Destroy the pilot! That'll expose the generator! This thing just keeps comin' back for more! 

Tifa: Gotta destroy that pilot quickly! We got it! 

Barret: How you like that!? 

Cloud: Now we can do some damage! All clear. 

Barret: And stay down! 

Cloud: Let's go. 

Tifa: Sure. 

Barret: Alright, this way.

[The robot sparks and explodes. We switch to Heidegger's office.]

Heidegger: This won't do. 

Subordinate: Sir, Analytics reports that the feed went down… after an anomaly was registered during the test. 

Heidegger: An “anomaly”? Or an excuse for your failure to properly prepare the armor?

Subordinate: N-no sir! All modules were confirmed fully operational! It's far more likely—given the circumstances—that the sensors were overloaded. 

Heidegger: Is that so? 

Subordinate: All the sensors in Section E are… inoperable. 

[The second assistant's phone is ringing. He's giving it to the boss.]

Subordinate: The president. 

Heidegger: Yes… Yes… Everything is fine, sir. Better, even there's been a development. Yes… Understood, sir. (hung up) We know exactly where they were headed. If the armor is intact, then you'd best determine the nature of this anomaly soon. Should you fail to do so… You will deal with our intruders. Personally.

Subordinate: …Y-yessir. 

Heidegger: Don't worry. I treat my people more than fairly. So don't disappoint me. 

[Back to the terrorists…]

Barret: The passage is beyond these shipping containers. Let's slip through 'em. Talk about a tight squeeze… 

Tifa: You okay. 

Barret: Yeah… 

Tifa: So, you bump into any giant robots like that in Reactor 1? 

Barret: Yeah, except the bastard looked like a scorpion! Speaking of which…what would you say that last one looked like? 

Tifa: Huh? Uh… Well… 

Cloud: Looks dead now. 

Barret: Lo and behold. All aboard…

[They get up on the freight elevator platform. Cloud pushes a button and the platform slowly goes down.]

Barret: Just so you know… it's not gonna get any easier. 

Cloud: When did it ever?

Chapter 6: Light the Way
[The trio comes out of the loading platform and looks around.]

Barret: Through here and straight on to Reactor 5.

Tifa: You make it sound so simple…

Barret: Only 'cause it is. That there's the reactor support pillar.

Cloud: So, what's the plan?

Barret: After plan E comes F, G, and then H!

Cloud: Thought E was the last.

Tifa: This here is Section F.

Barret: We cut through Section G and head for H.

Tifa: A cargo platform in H will get us closer to the reactor. Biggs should be somewhere over there. Looks like the sun's going down on Midgar…

Barret: Right. Double time! We got a date with a reactor.

[They walk down narrow metal platforms.]

Barret: Nothing but air below us.

Cloud: Shut up and move.

Tifa: Just don't look down, okay?

Barret: Easy for you to say. Section G's through here, huh? Hey. You see something over there?

Tifa: Maybe the gate didn't budge because there's not enough power to spare?

Barret: Gotta figure this out.

[Cloud uses a computer to find out.]

Announcement: Error. Insufficient power.

Cloud: (sighs) Of course.

Tifa: Hey guys, look at this. Instructions for dealing with a power shortage.

Cloud: Kill the lights, and we free up power for the gate and other stuff.

Tifa: "Sun lamps"… You think these are the plate suns? The closest thing we have to the real thing.

Barret: Gotta put out a sun just to open a gate huh?

Tifa: But if we go through with it, the grounders in Sector 4 will suffer…

Barret: Now or later sun's going out for good when we blow the reactor.

Tifa: That's true.

Cloud: Let's go.

Tifa: All these lamps… You'd think they'd be able to balance the load by now though.

Barret: Maybe. If the maintenance guys or whoever weren't playing hooky.

Tifa: The lamps are important, but when you think how much mako it must take to keep them running…

[They walk outside the computer room and see a large cylindrical turbine-like structure.]

Tifa: That's gotta be one. Man, look at the size of it.

Barret: That a console I see near the top of that ladder? A, uh, pretty tall ladder too.

Cloud: I’ll go.

Tifa: Okay. We'll wait down here.

[Cloud tuns off a switch on the lamp]

Console: Emergency power supply confirmed. Disengaging locking mechanisms.

Barret: Okay! That's that.

Tifa: Great job, Cloud!

[They open the gate.]

Barret: Next stop: Section G!

Tifa: Yep! And after that, Reactor 5!

[There’s a bunch of cocoons in spider webs behind the gate…]

Tifa: Not again…

Barret: Great. I'm sure those things'll welcome us just as warmly as before. Tell you what, the rot runs deep in this damn pizza.

[They start fighting some creepers.]

Barret: Don't mind us, y'all just passing through!

[The bridge though is broken.]

Cloud: No way to cross that.

Tifa: Gotta go where the catwalks take us. They busted?

Cloud: Powered down, is my guess.

Barret: Lucky us, am I right? One less thing for us to worry about. Filling the air that we gotta breathe with their shit.

Tifa: Monsters sure seem to like it. What's up with that?

Barret: It's like in the tunnels. They get twisted by the mako. But it all goes back to Shinra.

[Another bridge crashes just after Cloud steps one foot on it.]

Tifa: You okay?

Cloud: Yeah.

Barret: Going for that materia, weren't you?

Tifa: So close, and yet so far. This path’s no good now.

Barret: I'm sure there's another way to get there.

Tifa: Hm… Nothing we can do but search

Barret: And when we find it, we can finally snag that materia.

Tifa: Hey, let's take a moment to get our bearings.

Barret: We're still in G, right?

Tifa: Yeah. And to reach Mako Reactor 5, we need to go through Section H.

Cloud: Okay.

Tifa: Unfortunately, I didn't spot a connecting catwalk to Section H, did you?

Barret: Well, we could always do another lap.

Cloud: Go for ten, why don'tcha.

Tifa: The only other route that I can think of would be…

Cloud: Along the wall.

Tifa: Up for giving it a try? It might not work out, but it's the only idea I've got.

Cloud: It's not a bad one.

Barret: So we're shooting for those giant fan's way over there? Okay. At least we've got a clear landmark to guide us.

Tifa: Those ventilation fans?

Barret: Keeping the plate's air clean by pushing the smog into the slums. Whole system's designed to make shit roll downhill faster.

[Cloud starts wandering around.]

Tifa: You lost? I think we already checked this place out.

Barret: You know the best way to not get lost is to believe that you're not. Mind over matter.

Tifa: Isn’t that from one of Marlene’s books?

Barret: Yup, one of her favorites! Loves it when I read it to her before bedtime, doing all the voices.

Tifa: "Life in the Endless Maze," am I right? (laughs) I remember. Hey, look! I think we can climb onto that pipe!

Cloud: Sure seems that way.

Barret: Dammit.

Barret: I feel no fear… yeah, no fear… no fear… no fear… no fear… no fear—little fear! Hey guys, uh… you know these fans are really loud and…

Cloud: You chickening out?

Barret: Hell no!

Barret: I'm just worried that your bony ass is gonna get blown off the side and shit.

Tifa: Enough! We gotta keep moving!

Barret: O-okay then! Follow me! No worse than a windy day, huh?

Tifa: One with a tornado warning maybe. Don't look at the fan! Whatever you do.

Barret: Right.

Tifa: Hey, what's that behind the fan over there? Made it through in one piece.

Barret: Think that took a couple years off my life. I-I mean, uh, not really! Couple seconds maybe. Three tops!

Tifa: Section H is just up ahead! Slow and steady, guys.

Cloud: And that's our objective?

Tifa: The cargo platform? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the one.

[They find a large platform elevator that fits a couple of tanks in it.]

Barret: This is it. The cargo platform Biggs was talking about. Let's not keep him waiting.

[Cloud uses a computer nearby.]

Announcement: Error. Insufficient power.

Barret: You're kidding me.

Cloud: Needs three lights worth, looks like.

Tifa: But that's… That's all of them, isn't it?

Barret: All or nothing…

Tifa: Let's regroup here if we get lost. Remember the H-01 sign.

Cloud: Right.

Barret: Lessee now… Closest light ought to be…

Cloud: That one.

[He gets to work.]

Tifa: "By the light of these magnificent lamps… we shall lead our brothers and sisters of the undercity to brighter future."

Barret: Say what?

Tifa: It's from a speech President Shinra gave talking up the importance of the sun lamps.

Barret: Brighter future, my ass. Shinra's leading us down a one-way path to darkness and death.

Announcement: Error. Insufficient power.

Tifa: We need to disable a lamp first. Look! There's the switch.

Barret: Let’s flip it and go.

Announcement: Rerouting power. Please wait.

Tifa: That's one down.

Barret: Only two more lights to go.

Announcement: Reinitializing intrusion prevention system.

[A couple of machine guns are turned on around the "lamp"!]

Tifa: "Intrusion prevention"?

Cloud: Back online 'cause of us.

Barret: No need to fret, y'all. A few rusty mechs ain't gonna keep us from reaching the reactor.

Announcement: Intruders detected. Engaging countermeasures.

Cloud: Mid-range turrets, huh?

Barret: Hey, Cloud! Hang back while I deal with these pests!

Tifa: Just made our lives a lot harder.

Cloud: We restored power to more than just security, remember?

Tifa: We can move this catwalk!

[Cloud uses the terminal to move the bridge closer.]

Barret: Yeah! Lined it up perfect!

[They cross the bridge.]

Barret: Which way to the next light?

Tifa: If we can't make sense of this place we're gonna get lost.

Barret: Well at least we know where the big-ass things are. 

[Cloud pushes another switch on the lamp.]

Barret: And that makes two lights down.

Tifa: Meaning we've only got one left.

Barret: The end's in sight, y'all!

Cloud: Should be able to climb down from here.

Barret: This'll hold, right?

Cloud: That the Sector 4 slums down there?

Tifa: Huh? You wanna check them out sometime? I can show you around.

Barret: We'll check them out now if we fall!

Tifa: The power's on. You think they'll miss those three plate suns?

Barret: I say the real sun's the only one we need. To hell with Shinra and their night-lights.

Announcement: Intruders detected. Engaging countermeasures.

Tifa: Huh? We're going back?

Barret: If you've got shit to do then hurry up!

Tifa: Hmm… Where was that last light again?

Barret: Where could they be going…? Embarking on an adventure to find some treasure!?

Announcement: Ventilation system service mode active. Access maintenance terminal to complete procedure.

[Cloud uses a computer and stops the giant fans.]

Tifa: We stop it?

Announcement: Switching ventilation system to maintenance mode. Please complete the maintenance access procedure within the designated time limit.

Barret: Man, what are we even doing?

Announcement: Access granted. Disengaging time lock.

Cloud: Okay.

[They enter the ventilation shaft.]

Barret: What? This is summoning materia!

Tifa: Wow…

Barret: What kind of badass will pop outta this one?

Cloud: We'll see.

Barret: Think back. Anybody see a connecting catwalk. Hold up. We rode this thing before.

Tifa: But you knew that, right Cloud?

[They are getting closer to the last lamp.]

Tifa: Almost done. It's a shame we had to wander around so much.

Barret: Well. No Stamps here to guide us. No Jessie or Wedge to back us up neither.

Tifa: Yeah… Speaking of which, what should we tell Biggs? I don't want him to worry.

[They continue to the lamp.]

Barret: Uhh, you takin' a detour? Well, aight then. Heads up, y'all. If there's no viable path, we'll just have to make one.

[Cloud turns off the last switch.]

Tifa: And that makes three. Enough to finally get our cargo platform moving.

Cloud: Better be.

Barret: Okay! Let's head on back to the H-01 sign.

Tifa: I hope that Jessie's injury isn't anything serious.

Barret: The best thing you can do to speed her recovery is to kick Shinra ass in her stead.

Tifa: I know. I know, And Cloud's gotta cover for Wedge, too.

Cloud: When do we link up with Biggs?

Barret: Soon enough, don't you worry.

Tifa: He knew we might be late, so he came up with a few ways to kill time.

Barret: We oughta reach him long before he dies of boredom.

Tifa: And we're back at the cargo platform.

Barret: Get ready, Mako Reactor 5. We're coming.

[Cloud pushes a button on the console near the large cargo platform.]

Announcement: Auxiliary power supply confirmed. Reactivating cargo platform. Cargo platform activated, Awaiting input.

[They enter the platform and it starts moving.]

Barret: So long, underplate, I hate you too.

Tifa: Wonder what the reactor's like.

Barret: Dark. Dismal. A slaughterhouse where they butcher the planet. Then there's the smell. The mako. Be ready for it.

Tifa: Right.

Barret: Hear that, guys? It's the reactor calling us. Beckoning us, saying, "Bring it on, Avalanche."

Announcement: Intruders detected. Engaging countermeasures.

Barret: Okay. Biggs should be waiting for us up ahead.

Tifa: He's probably worried sick about us.

[They go through a narrow ventilation shaft.]

Tifa: Even after all that fighting, no one's coming for us?

Cloud: No need. This is Shinra's city. They probably have cameras everywhere.

Tifa: Why didn't you say something sooner?

Cloud: Way too late to bail now.

Barret: It's like walking a tightrope. When you're on it, only two ways off.

Tifa: Better keep my balance.

Cloud: You'd be good at it.

Tifa: (smiles) I wonder.

Barret: Almost there.

Cloud: Tifa?

Tifa: It's nothing. Just thinking about the next step. Didn't think I'd be this nervous.

Barret: Some things you never get used to.

Tifa: Yeah.

[Cloud spots someone in the shadows and instantly pulls out his huge sword, putting it to the stranger's throat.]

Biggs: Mercy! Wait… Cloud? Where's Jessie and Wedge?

Barret: Report.

Biggs: Topside's going nuts after some terrorists jumped off a train. Nice and quiet here, though. So quiet I had no trouble securing your route into the reactor.

Barret: You magnificent son of a bitch, bring it in!

[He tries to hug Biggs but he dodges.]

Biggs: So—where are the others?

Tifa: Jessie got hurt and couldn't make it.

Biggs: Bad?

Barret: Not so bad she couldn't rope in this guy.

Biggs: Thanks for stepping up.

Cloud: It's a job.

Biggs: Worked out pretty good, you picking that train you did. While Shinra scours Sector 4… You can waltz right on into Sector 5. It's a bit of a squeeze, but it ought to get you where you need to go.

Barret: Little dark and foreboding for my taste…

Biggs: Beggars can't be choosers. Oh and you'll be needing your grappling guns, of course. All set?

Barret: Ready to take on the world and then some!

Tifa: Make sure everyone gets clear, okay?

Biggs: Will do!

[He uses his grappling pistol and jumps down a ventilation shaft. Barret closes the lid after him.]

Barret: Okay, y'all. Keep these grappling guns close. Secure 'em to your belt or whatever so you don't lose 'em. When we're done, we'll be using these babies to get down safe. All of us.

Cloud: Got it.

Chapter 7: A Trap Is Sprung
[The scene changes to the sinister Shinra Corporation and see its emblem of two characters 神羅 covered in gold. 神 - god, deity, emperor and 羅 - lightweight fabric or thin silk. The staff and soldiers are in the middle of preparing for the filming.]

Heidegger: Quickly now. Quickly!

[The president is watching our terrorists through the camera and squints…]

Barret: That's it. That's the smell. This place reeks of mako.

Tifa: Looks like we made it.

Barret: Layout's the same as Reactor 1?

Cloud: Yeah. We're near mako storage.

Barret: Let's move.

[They continue their quest.]

Barret: I'm not seeing a way down…

Tifa: Here maybe?

Barret: Well now! That could work. I'm next.

[They jump down using pipes.]

Tifa: Kinda scary, huh?

Cloud: S'all in the mind.

[They find a menacingly looking robot.]

Barret: Hey! Check it out. They sic this big boy on us, we'd be screwed six ways from Sunday.

Cloud: Mechanized units like these were designed to take out giant monsters. Probably a new prototype. If they do decide to deploy it, then our best bet would be to run like hell.

Barret: Then let's hope he sleeps through the explosion.

Tifa: Where is everybody?

Barret: You mean Shinra? Got spooked and cleared out, is my guess.

Tifa: Almost there… The smell… It takes me back… Guys!

[They encounter a robot.]

Barret: Well, well! What we got here!?

Cloud: Turrets up top.

Barret: I can deal with those things!

Tifa: So… it was like this last time?

Barret: Little more chaotic—ain't that right?

Cloud: Yeah.

[Cloud moves on and wanders a little bit off from the group. Suddenly his head starts to hurt. He kneels down and sees past events from the same place in front of him. Tifa, for some reason dressed as a cowboy, is mourning an unknown man lying on the floor.]

Tifa: Sephiroth… SOLDIERS… Mako… Shinra… I'm sick of this! I'm sick of all of this!

[She picks up a long katana and walks away. Cloud comes to his senses.]

Barret: Hey! SOLDIER boy!

Cloud: Tifa—

Tifa: What?

[Without answering, Cloud goes to the main computer. He holds out his hand and Barrett reluctantly gives him the bomb.]

Cloud: How much time we need?

Barret: Got all the time in the world. This one comes with a remote detonator.

Tifa: Courtesy of Jessie.

Barret: We withdraw to a safe distance—then…kaboom!

Cloud: "Safe" distance?

Barret: What? No such thing? (smirks) We get out the same way we got in. Let's double back.

[Suddenly, the staircase they were going down goes up…]

Barret: What the— Where you goin'!?

Cloud: Weirdly perfect timingю

Tifa: Wait a minute. Is someone watching us?

[Several flying drones fill the room and surround the group.]

Holographic Heidegger: (laughs) Greetings, my dear sewer rats! As architect of our populace engagement campaign, Heidegger, head of Public Security… bid you welcome.

Barret: The chief warmonger.

Holographic Heidegger: You should be flattered. Right now, you command the undivided attention of every soul in Midgar.

Tifa: What is this!?

[A holographic TV turns on.]

Announcer: Breaking news from Mako Reactor 5. Shinra has confirmed the reactor to be the target of the bomb threat issued by the terrorist group Avalanche. Members of the group were observed entering the facility, and security is currently sweeping it for explosive devices. We now go live to the scene…

[There’s quite an outrage outside the reactor.]

Reporter: I'm here in the Sector 5 undercity. Having confirmed the terrorists' target… the Shinra Emergency Operations Center has issued an evacuation advisory. Residents are outraged that the tragedy of Mako Reactor 1 was only the first attack… in a campaign of violence.

Announcer: President Shinra has issued a statement providing assurances that the terrorists will soon be brought to justice.

Holographic Heidegger: And so, to a people beset by chaos and uncertainty, we will offer the finest comfort: bread and circus!

[He brings the robot the group saw earlier.]

Barret: The big boy!

Heidegger: I give you Shinra's latest triumph of technology! The airbuster! Your executioner!

[The robot swings and the group cringes in fear. However, the robot turns out to be a hologram. Heidegger laughs contentedly.]

Voice Subordinate: Engineering on the line. Currently, the airbuster is only sixty percent operational. The estimates were optimistic…

Holographic Heidegger: (angerly) I'm on air!

[The connection closes abruptly.]

Heidegger: (via radio) To the imbecile in charge down there— you are hereby ordered to seize those intruders and bring them to me!

[A few solders rushes in and the terrorists.]

Elite Shock Trooper: Come quietly or there'll be trouble!

Heidegger: (via radio) Attention all security forces! I repeat—you are to bring the insurgents to the command center without further delay! What's Engineering's progress on getting that airbuster operational? …Still only sixty percent!? Bullshit! I swear, if you fail me, I'll throw you off the plate myself! So get it done already!

Barret: Shut the hell up!

Tifa: I don't believe it… We played right into Shinra's hands!

Barret: Yeah. And their bullshit news is already peddling their false narrative.

Tifa: So we're screwed.

Barret: No no no no no! Hell no! Listen! They wanna turn this into a spectacle? Then la say let's give 'em one! Let's take down Shinra's big-ass mech in front of everybody!

Cloud: Okay, I'm sold.

[They continue. Meanwhile in the command center…]

Security Officer: You heard the man! Get these components prepped for the airbuster ASAP!

Security Officer: It's ready, sir!

Security Officer: Component outbound from B8.

Engineering Officer: Copy, B8.

[Cloud and the others enter the command center.]

Security Officer: Intruders!

Security Officer: Take 'em out!

Barret: All clear! Now let's see what these bastards were up to…

Tifa: Barret, Cloud! Over here! Cloud, check this out! It looks like a few of its components are still in transit…

Barret: (laughs) We'll see about that.

Cloud: Could tamper a little with its loadout…

Tifa: And give ourselves an edge?

Cloud: There should be a console somewhere…

Barret: This the console you talking about? Think you can get it to work?

Cloud: Needs a keycard.

Barret: Well, let's find it then!

Tifa: You find it?

Cloud: Yeah.

Barret: Good job! Now, let's check out that console.

Tifa: "M units," huh? I'm guessing that's some sort of component?

Cloud: Yep. An enhancement powered by liquefied materia.

Barret: Sounds bad.

Cloud: Pretty sure I can divert this unit for disposal.

[He pushes a few buttons.]

Console: M unit flagged for disposal.

Barret: Heidegger's got no idea who he's messin' with!

Tifa: So far so good.

Barret: Right. Let's move!

Console: Diverting M unit to disposal room.

Tifa: You think they're watching us? Even now?

Cloud: Yep. Probably got a live feed.

Barret: Nothing we can do about it… 'cept smile for the folks at home.

Security Officer: Component outbound from B7.

Engineering Officer: Copy.

Engineering Officer: We've lost contact with B8. Send some men to check it out. We've got a schedule to keep!

Security Officer: Intruders! Seize them!

Security Officer: Engineering, this is B7! We've got hostiles! Requesting backup!

Engineering Officer: Negative B7, airbuster prep is priority. You're on your own!

Security Officer: Copy!

Security Officer: Then we'll deal with you ourselves!

Tifa: Looks like there's two consoles this time.

Barret: Hah! Double the sabotage!

Cloud: If we can find the keycards.

Tifa: Any cards?

Cloud: Just the one.

Tifa: Two choices, and only one single-use card… It's up to you, Cloud.

Tifa: What does an "Al programming core" do?

Cloud: Increases processing power dedicated to motor function computation. Makes it move real quick.

Tifa: A "real quick" giant robot, huh? That doesn't sound good. Anyway, we should weigh our options carefully.

Barret: Console talks about big bomber shells. You acquainted?

Cloud: We called 'em BBs. One's enough to blow you to hell and back.

Barret: Could divert them and give it a couple less shots to take us out. Make the call.

Console: Big bomber shell flagged for disposal.

Barret: Just imagining their faces when they find out…

Tifa: So, where did we send the discarded stuff?

Cloud: To a storeroom for defective equipment, I'm guessing.

Barret: That so… You think these defective shells and programming cores might be valuable enough to warrant a little… detour?

Cloud: Maybe.

Barret: I say we grab 'em.

Cloud: Hmph. If we get that far.

Barret: Okay! Listen up, y'all! Everything Shinra has told you is a goddamn lie! Mako is the lifeblood of our planet! Those greedy bastards are bleeding it dry! Y'all gotta rise up—

Tifa: Barret!? Who are you talking to?

Barret: The people! Put me on TV, I'mma drop some truth!

Cloud: Thousand gil says they cut the sound.

[They continue fighting the security.]

Elite Shock Trooper: Surprise, grounders!

[The group enters B6.]

Security Officer: Good to go?

Security Officer: Locked and loaded!

Security Officer: Heads up! We got company!

Security Officer: Take 'em down!

Security Officer: Engineering, this is B6—enemy contact! Enemy contact!

Engineering Officer: Shit! We can't afford any more delays. You need to keep those components coming-do whatever it takes!

[All the officers are down.]

Barret: Piece o' cake!

Tifa: Find any cards?

Cloud: Only one. And this time we've got three choices…

Tifa: Take your pick. Al programming core… Hmm… What are you thinking, Cloud? Should we get rid of it?

Barret: I tell you what, I ain't never looked forward to an execution more in my entire life!

Tifa: You don't say.

Barret: We're about to make fools outta Shinra while the whole damn city's watching! Times like these you gotta savor!

Tifa: Oh no if you're about to ask me to dance, then don't.

Barret: C'mon, don't be shy! How 'bout you, Cloud?

Cloud: I don't dance.

Barret: Hell is this?

Cloud: M unit. Another type of enhancement.

Barret: Your call if you wanna nix it. Feel like scrapping some BBs? Hurry up and decide what you wanna get rid of. It's past time we taught Shinra a lesson! The more M units it's got, the tougher it'll be, right? We could do something about that. If you want.

Console: M unit flagged for disposal.

Barret: Serves y'all right!

[They enter B5.]

Engineering Officer: B5, this is Engineering. You need to pick up the pace we're running dangerously low on components because of those terrorists!

Security Officer: Copy!

Security Officer: They're here!

Security Officer: Stop them!

Security Officer: Dammit! You'll pay for this!

Barret: Buncha pushovers. C'mon, y'all. Let's see what kinda mischief they were getting up to.

Cloud: Four consoles. And never enough keycards…

Tifa: An Al programming core. Should we discard this or something else?

Console: Programming core flagged for disposal.

Tifa: Heidegger's not gonna like that. Al programming cores help it move faster, right? Divert it or not?

Barret: That's an M unit, right?

Cloud: Yep.

Barret: This is our chance to really stick it to Shinra. We should think it through before we make a decision. Big bomber shells. We should divert them if you think it'll improve our odds.

Console: Big bomber shell flagged for disposal.

Barret: Just imagining their faces when they find out….

Tifa: Think we've done enough to weaken the robot?

Cloud: All that we can, at least.

Barret: It's all good. The stage is set all that's left is to hijack Heidegger's show! We're coming up on the exit. Tifa—detonator still in range?

Tifa: We should be good.

Barret: The moment big boy goes down, you hit that switch.

Tifa: Right.

Barret: Can't say we didn't prepare. Now we just gotta get it done!

Tifa: That just leads back down

Engineering Officer: Status report!

Security Officer: We're making our final adjustments!

Engineering Officer: Work faster! Or you'll hear it from the brass!

Barret: Look! They're still preppin' it!

[Cloud and the other enters.]

Engineering Officer: They're here! Hold 'em back! Buy us every second you can!

Heidegger: (via radio) What is the status of my airbuster? Report!

Engineering Officer: I'm sorry, sir. We're going to need more time! The terrorists have breached the room and are engaging our forces. At this rate, there's no tell when we'll have it fully operational!

Heidegger: (via radio) As expected. Deploy it at once!

Engineering Officer: But sir, it's not ready yet!

Heidegger: (via radio) That was an order!

Engineering Officer: Understood. Prepare the airbuster for immediate deployment!

Barret: Shit! We too late?

Engineering Officer: That's far enough, you bastards! I'm taking you down!

Barret: Y'all never had a chance!

Tifa: Hey, guys. Looks like a performance assessment, don't you think?

Cloud: Well figure out its weaknesses as we fight it. As long as we stay focused, we'll be fine. We can do this.

Barret: For real, though, we need to talk victory poses. Something coordinated for the live, on-camera finish! Could blow up big—start a new trend!

Cloud: Veto. (Latin for "I forbid")

Barret: Huh. No way up?

Tifa: 'No way we're getting back up that pipe…

Cloud: Keep looking.

[They continue to fight their way to the trap.]

Tifa: Hear that?

Barret: Damn near gave me a heart attack! Bastard cleared the way for us.

Cloud: Real subtle invitation.

Barret: We were gonna spring the trap anyway!

Barret: Big boy's going to an execution all right. We're gonna put him out of his misery while the whole damn city watches!

Tifa: We give it our all and we'll win!

[They enter an elevator.]

Barret: We're gonna get through this. We're gonna make it home. All of us. No exceptions.

Tifa: Right. We don't wanna disappoint Marlene. That goes for you too, Cloud. Right?

Barret: You'd better give her a big ol' smile this time.

Cloud: If the price is right.

[After they leave the elevator, Cloud approaches a console and tries to unlock the nearby door.]

Barret: What? Open it already!

Cloud: It's locked down.

Tifa: Is there any way we can get it open?

Cloud: Yeah. From that room over there.

Barret: Why does everything have to be so damn complicated…?

Cloud: You know, the faulty equipment storeroom's that way too.

Tifa: Do you think we'll find the components we diverted there?

Barret: It's like a treasure vault! Hoo, I like the sound of that!

Tifa: So how do we do this?

Cloud: It's simple, really. We move the levers at the same time.

Tifa: Got these ones.

Barret: I'll take left. Which just leaves right, SOLDIER boy.

Announcement: Emergency lockdown is currently in effect.

Tifa: So we need to synchronize our movements?

Barret: In that case, follow my lead.

Cloud: Nah—Tifa's.

Barret: Fine! Have it your way!

Tifa: Okay, pay attention, you two… Three, two, one…

Barret: Shit!

Tifa: Shake it off. Three, two, one…

Announcement: Emergency lockdown disengaged.

Barret: Gotcha!

Tifa: Now that is what I call teamwork!

Cloud: Go team.

Barret: Whatcha'll got tucked away in that vault, huh?

[Cloud unlock the door on the console.]

Barret: This would be the treasure vault?

Cloud: That's right.

Tifa: What's the catch?

Cloud: Need to bypass a high-level security lock.

Barret: Different from the other one?

Cloud: Same deal, but we gotta do it several times.

Barret: Tightwads! But hearing that just makes me wanna rob 'em more!

Tifa: Yeah. Let's stick it to 'em!

Announcement: Delta-level security lockdown is currently in effect.

Tifa: Okay, guys. You know what we have to do.

Barret: Copy me?

Cloud: No, Tifa leads.

Barret: Oh, fine! After you, girl.

Tifa: Gotta get past level one first, right? Three, two, one…

Announcement: Alpha-level security disengaged.

Tifa: That was great, you guys! Let's keep it up! Alright. Three, two, one…

Announcement: Beta-level security-disengaged.

Tifa: Wow! Think we've got this?

Barret: Hell yeah, bring it on! Ain't nothing I love more than sticking it to Shinra!

Tifa: Halfway there. Steady, guys. Three, two, one…

Announcement: Gamma-level security disengaged.

Tifa: No way! You guys are naturals! Okay, final round. Don't lose focus. Three, two, one…

Announcement: Delta-level security-disengaged. Disposal room now accessible.

Barret: Boo-yah! Bet all the Shinra suits watching enjoyed that!

Tifa: You guys were great! I swear, your timing was perfect. It's almost like… you could read my mind. SOLDIERS can't do that, can they?

Cloud: I can't—yet.

Tifa: (laughs) Thank god.

Barret: C'mon, you two, let's see what we got.

Tifa: Score! It's just like Cloud said!

Barret: They say a job well done's its own reward… I say take everything that ain't nailed down!

[They rob a couple of Shinra’s storage capsules full of goodies.]

Barret: All right, time to go!

Tifa: Look!

[Several drones appear. A holographic image of the President appears.]

Barret: President Shinra!?

Holographic President Shinra: Oho. The eyes of one who has bathed in mako… Which would make you… a SOLDIER?

Cloud: (pulls out his sword) Ex-SOLDIER.

Holographic President Shinra: Once a SOLDIER, always a SOLDIER. Though not, alas, for very long. Accelerated cellular degradation being the most common cause of death by far. This is classified, of course, but every SOLDIER knows the truth.

Cloud: …That's right.

Barret: (shots) Think you forgettin' someone!?

Holographic President Shinra: Would that I could. You strike me as the type to go on without end.

Barret: Ain't enough hours in the day to hold you to account for all your crimes!

Holographic President Shinra:  And what a wasteful indulgence it would be even if there were.

Barret: Oh, okay then… Let's talk about wasteful indulgences. What is mako? The lifestream! The lifeblood of the planet—our planet! But Shinra keeps on slurping it up like a thirsty dog! Whadda you think's gonna happen if you don't stop, huh!?

Holographic President Shinra: We do indeed keep on "slurping it up," as you say… But… for whose benefit, I wonder. The true nature of mako is known to one and all, yet the people willfully turn a blind eye to the cost. As you must surely be aware?

Barret: Don't you dare try to put this on us! (destroys a drone) If anyone's going along with your plans… it's 'cause you brainwashed 'em!

Holographic President Shinra: Such methods are beneath me. As are you, my faithful sewer rats. Henceforth allies of wicked Wutai, our sworn enemy. Thank you for stoking our people's patriotic fervor. (disconnects)

Barret: Wutai? The hell we are!

Holographic Heidegger: (laughs) You still don't understand your role in this.

Barret: What are they doin'!?

[The drones make changes to the bomb the group planted.]

Holographic Heidegger: Don't you see? You fools were never in control! Never anything but pawns in our plans to sell great and glorious war to the people! And your instruments of insurrection will detonate—

[He uses his own detonator and 25 minutes timers starts on the bomb.]

Holographic Heidegger: when we so choose!

[Tifa tries to use the detonator but nothing happens.]

Barret: Goddammit!

Holographic Heidegger: Now let us raise the curtain on our main event!

[A helicopter brings in on cables the very robot the group has seen recently.]

Holographic Heidegger: The trial of the eco-extremist group "Avalanche"! Terrorists who conspired with Wutai against Midgar! Your guilt is undeniable! Your punishment: death!

[Tifa destroys the drone with a nice leg kick.]

Tifa: I’m sick of this. I'm sick of all of this!

Cloud: (remembers) It's just like… like when I failed you.

Barret: Cloud! Get your head in the game! We're counting on you, man.

[The battle begins!]

Tifa: Cloud, are you all right?

Cloud: I'm fine. You guys good to go?

Barret: As good as I'll ever be!

[They fight a little.]

Tifa: Cloud? What'd it do to you?

Barret: Dammit! Big boy means business!

Heidegger: (via loudspeaker) Commencing phase too of the combat trial. You've seen but a fraction of this machine's true capabilities!

Barret: Damn, that thing's powerful!

Tifa: That was too close…

Cloud: We need to come up with a plan.

Heidegger: (via loudspeaker) Your efforts are futile. It'll chase you to the edge of the world if need be.

Tifa: That when they do that!

Cloud: Let's take care of them first.

Heidegger: (via loudspeaker) Hmph! I hope this isn't the end for you three. I was looking forward to a battle against worthy opponents.

Tifa: Now we can hit it where it hurts!

Heidegger: (via loudspeaker) Behold the full potential of the airbuster! Time to carry out your executions!

Cloud: Damn, all those drones. Time to do your thing, big man.

Barret: Watch and learn! Just make sure you got my back, all right?

Cloud: Now! Get in there!

Barret: Let me show ya now it's done!

Cloud: Yeah. Light ‘em up!

Cloud: Now!

Tifa: Right! Give it all you've got!

Heidegger: My dearest Avalanche. My apologies, but it is time that we part ways. This footage will prove invaluable in raising the morale of our Shinra rank and file.

Cloud: We almost got this. Come on, guys!

Tifa: Bring it on!

Barret: Let's show 'em what we're made of!

[They finally manage to defeat the robot. It explodes, partially destroying the bridge the group was standing on. Tifa and Barrett are thrown to one side and Cloud to the other. He hangs on the edge of an abyss.]

Barret: We don't have long to get clear!

Cloud: Take Tifa, and get outta here!

Barret: I… I was wrong aboutchya—

Cloud: This ain't the end of the line for you or me!

Tifa: Cloud!

[Some drones appear and start shooting at Tifa and Barret.]

Barret: C'mon!

[He grabs Tifa and runs. Cloud deliberately falls and shoots the cable into the rest of the bridge, but the cable fails and Cloud falls into the abyss. He, being unconscious, falls endlessly into a glowing white spot. White petals fly around him and ghost-like jellyfish hover. Soon he finds himself sitting surrounded by bright white light. Someone approaches him.]

Voice: Hey, buddy. You okay?

Cloud: Yeah.

Voice: Made it through with just a couple of scraped knees back then…

Cloud: "Back then"?

Voice: Whaddya say? We doing this?

Cloud: Have we—

Voice: Never mind about that. Right now, you need to focus on yourself. Move something, anything.

Cloud: Why not…

Voice: Good. Easy does it. Slow… and steady…

Cloud: Yeah, yeah…

[He opens his eyes.]

Voice: Hello?

Cloud: Hey, uh… Who are you?

[White glow turns black.]

Cloud: Who are you!?

Sephiroth: I am… your everything.

???: Hello in there!

Sephiroth: Oh, Cloud. There's still so much to be done.

Chapter 8: Budding Bodyguard
[Cloud comes to his senses in the old church. He broke through the roof and fell into a clearing of white flowers. A familiar girl stands right next to him.]

Flower Peddler: Maybe you're not okay… Ah, he lives! Finally awake are we?

Cloud: You're…

Aerith: Aerith. It's Aerith. And you are…?

Cloud: Cloud.

Aerith: Nice to meet you again.

Cloud: "Again," huh?

Aerith: What? You don't remember? What about the flowers?

Cloud: Onhh… The flower girl. And this is…?

Aerith: An old church in the Sector 5 slums. You came crashing through the roof without so much as a "look out below." Fell right into my flower bed. Lucky for you. Like, really.

Cloud: S-sorry, I-I didn't mean to—

Aerith: Don't worry about it. They're a lot tougher than they look. This place… It has a kind of power. Before forget you dropped this when you landed.

[She hands him a ball of green materia.]

Cloud: Thanks.

Aerith: I've got one too.

Cloud: You and everybody and their mother.

Aerith: Not like mine, no. It's special. Mine's not good for anything at all.

[Cloud sees some visions vith praying, tears and splashes of water.]

Cloud: Bet you just don't know how to use it.

Aerith: Could be. Though, I really don't mind. Just having it is enough. It was a gift from my mother. Pretty crazy, huh? Us meeting again like this. You should stay awhile. 

[Cloud approaches Aerith and accepts her offer.]

Aerith: Really!? You will!? In that case…

[A cocky kid with red hair and a baton in his hands enters a church. He is accompanied by two Shinra soldiers.]

Reno: I'll see myself in, thanks. And who are you?

Aerith: He's my bodyguard. And a SOLDIER. Pretty cool, huh?

Reno: A SOLDIER?

Cloud: Ex-SOLDIER.

Reno: Well whaddya know, you've got the eyes at least.

Aerith: You don't mind, do you? Bodyguard work's not too different from merc stuff, right? Uh… I guessed! From the sword! Just do this for me, okay?

Cloud: Fine, but it'll cost you. A lot.

Aerith: A Jot, huh? One date ought to do it.

Reno: Huh. Well, you're weird crough to be one… What class?

Cloud: (smirks) First.

Reno: (nasty laugh) If you're gonna bullshit me, at least try to make it believable…

[Cloud swings his sword and Reno kicks it so Cloud backs up. He nods Aerith to take cover.]

Reno: Ooh!

Aerith: Hey! Watch the flowers!

Reno: You heard the lady.

[Shinra soldiers shot but Cloud deals with them in a matter of seconds.]

Cloud: I'll make this quick.

Aerith: You better!

Reno: Bodyguard huh? You know I'm hers too, right?

Aerith: Really? Since when? This is the first I've heard of it.

Reno: 'Cause it was a classified op, princess.

Aerith: I don't think that counts then.

Reno: Ugh… Hey! Little help in here, guys? Good ol' what's-his-face. Hardly knew ya. Hate doing cleanup, but… I'm damn good at it!

Aerith: Cloud, be careful!

Reno: Whatcha waiting for, bodyguard? I'm right here! Gonna make me work for it, huh?

Reno: Well, lucky for you—tough guy… I'm a consummate professional! Figured this dance of ours could use a spark!

Aerith: Do you really have to fight near the flowers?

Reno: Not so tough now, are you! Yoo-hoo! SOLDIER boy! You've got it all wrong, man. I just wanted to—

[He falls on the floor. Cloud swind his sword to deliver the final blow.]

Aerith: Cloud! No!

[Suddenly a bunch of phantoms resembling an upside down bag appears. Some force pushes Cloud and Aerith to the nearby room and closes the door. A couple of Shinra soldiers burst in.]

Security Officer: Huh?

Security Officer: Were they—

Security Officer: Sir! Are you hurt!?

Reno: (pushes him) I'm fine! Go get the girl.

Security Officer: Sir!

Cloud: The hell?

[The phantoms float around them.]

Aerith: Weird. They're not attacking.

Security Officer: Hey! Open up!

Cloud: C'mon.

Aerith: Over here! 

[Cloud follows Aerith.]

Aerith: Nowhere to go but up… Through the attic maybe we can get out that way!

Cloud: Right. Through that hole.

Aerith: Huh?  They saved me…

[Cloud walks across a narrow plank left over from the ruined floor.]

Cloud: C'mon. I'll go first. Come on.

[Shinra soldiers burst in.]

Security Officer: Nothing!

Security Officer: Up there!

Reno: Hey! No shooting!

[Aerith loses her balance and falls a floor down.]

Aerith: Aw, man…

Cloud: Hey! You okay!?

Aerith: Probably! …Or maybe not.

Reno: If there's so much as a scratch on her… you're done.

Security Officer: Sir!

Reno: We bring her in in one piece.

Security Officer: Huh?

Reno: What now?

[The phantoms surround Aerith.]

Cloud: Run!

Security Officer: Move and I'll shoot!

Reno: Oh no, you won't!

Security Officer: But, sir.

Cloud: Could drop that. Can't leave now. She needs help. Okay.

[He tries to get to Aerith through the partially destroyed hall of the church.]

Reno: What's the holdup!?

Security Officer: I can't get to her!

Reno: Huh. Some kind of magic trick? Huh. Some kind of magic trick?

Cloud: Run!

Aerith: ‘Kay!

Reno: Stop her!

Security Officer: Over there!

Aerith: Cloud! Over here! 

[Cloud reunites with Aerith. The soldiers try to shoot them dispite their orders.]

Aerith: Thank you!

Cloud: Let's move.

Aerith: Cloud, gimme a hand!

Security Officer: They're in the attic. Should we pursue?

Reno: Nah. Leave 'em be.

Security Officer: But, sir!

Reno: Partner's got it. We. Are. Out. Beginner's luck.

[Meanwhile Cloud and Aerith climb to the attic.]

Cloud: More of those things…

Aerith: It's like they're… guiding us.

Cloud: Stay close.

Aerith: So cool. There!

Cloud: Need to stay ahead of 'em.

[They see the soldiers on the first floor.]

Security Officer: Prep for exfil.

Cloud: Or not…? They gone?

Aerith: Yeah. Think so.

Cloud: What are they?

Aerith: I think… Actually… I don't know. Let's just go. 

[They walk out to the rooftops.]

Aerith: Okay. Up for crossing the rooftops? See that pillar over there? There’s a station right by it. Shall we mosey on over?

Cloud: Let's.

Aerith: So… what's next for you?

Cloud: A little bit of bodyguard work.

Aerith: Right.

Cloud: After that, it's back to the Sector 7 slums.

Aerith: You… know how to get there?

Cloud: Yup.

Aerith: 'Course you do…

Cloud: That suit from earlier. He was one of Shinra's Turks. What's a Turk want with you?

Aerith: Dunno. Hey, don't Turks keep an eye out for potential SOLDIERS and stuff?

Cloud: They do more than just scout for candidates. Turks get called in to handle al kinds of situations. With extreme prejudice.

Aerith: Professional bad guys. Gotta love 'em.

Cloud: Back to my question. So what's he to you? Looked like you knew each other.

Aerith: Maybe he thought I could be the greatest SOLDIER yet!

Cloud: Forget it.

Aerith: Hmm? You mad?

Cloud: Careful. Not a lotta room.

Aerith: Gotcha. Thanks. I… actually… haven't traveled by rooftop before.

Cloud: Be surprised if you had.

Aerith: It's honestly… kind of exciting.

Cloud: Well… First time and all.

Aerith: Wait! Give me a moment! Don't just… run off on your own…

Cloud: Those the words of a SOLDIER candidate?

Aerith: So petty.

Cloud: So, does no one live in these buildings?

Aerith: Nope. No one to get mad if we make noise. 

[They find an old water tower and decide to climb on it.]

Aerith: Looks kinda… rusty.

Cloud: I'll go first. It's pretty old. Be careful.

Aerith: Okay…

Cloud: Easy now.

Aerith: You worry too much. I'm not some princess who needs to be coddled. 

[The ladder falls and Aerith hands on the edge.]

Aerith: Shit.

[Cloud helps her.]

Aerith: Whew, that was unexpected! Thank you, Cloud. Ah, there it is. The wall. You know, I thought about leaving once… But… in the end, I couldn't.

Cloud: Too dangerous?

Aerith: Too much. A whole world, bursting with life… Maybe more than I can handle, I think sometimes… Even now. People hate the steel sky, the slums… but I don't. How could I? All that passion, all those dreams… Flowing and blending together into something greater… 

[They continue and encounter a plank between buildings.]

Aerith: This time I'll go first. After all, I can't count on you to wait.

Cloud: Sure about this?

Aerith: See for yourself! Hmm…

Aerith: Maybe I'll go on ahead and leave you all by your lonesome. Just— (almost falls)

Cloud: Maybe you shouldn't tak.

Aerith: Then you talk. Tell me a story.

Cloud: Not for free.

Aerith: Cheapskate. You're— (almost falls) Gotcha.

Cloud: You're killing me here.

Aerith: Here goes nothing!

[She cheerfully jumps down a rusty pipe… Cloud’s forced to follow her.]

Cloud: You good?

Aerith: Of course!

[She prepares to jump down but a dove frightens her and she falls… only to find herself in Cloud’s arms. ]

Aerith: My hero!

Cloud: Never a dull moment with you.

Aerith: That a compliment?

Cloud: Not really.

Aerith: Thanks anyway!

[Aerith Gainsborough joins the party! They finally reach the ground - to some kind of junkyard that is.]

Aerith: We're getting closer to the station. Even so, we'll probably run into a few monsters on the way. 

[Cloud smirks.]

Aerith: Heh… There's a face that screams “so what?”

Cloud: I've fought scarier things in my sleep.

[They continue fighting through the junkyard.]

Aerith: Where are you going, Cloud? Look out, Cloud! Someone looks like they're in their element. So Cloud… you don't know the slums that well, do you?

Cloud: Compared to you? No. Training grounds, barracks, battlefields—that's the world I know.

Aerith: Heh, you sound proud of that. Station's there.

Cloud: I can see that.

Aerith: Oh? Thought the world you knew didn't include stations.

Cloud: Hah hah…

[They go out to the station. Many people are gathered on the platform, discussing something vividly.]

Undercity Resident: We poured so much of our blood and sweat into building that reactor, and now…

Undercity Resident: I can't believe this is happening…

Station Worker: If you would all just please calm down…

Undercity Resident: Hey, what the hell's going on!?

Girl: Check it out, Mom!

Undercity Resident: Come on, there's no need to shout…

Cloud: Popular place.

Aerith: Yeah, well, it's got a good view of the reactor.

Undercity Resident: It's on fire!

Cloud: Ain't a show.

Aerith: They know that. They're worried.

Undercity Resident: Oh! Didn't expect to see you here.

[Aerith notices a familiar face.]

Aerith: Huh? Um… Yeah…

Undercity Resident: Oh, on your way home from the church?

Aerith: That's… right.

Undercity Resident: Well, I'm glad you're okay. Did any debris hit the church?

Aerith: Not debris, no…

Undercity Resident: That's something, at least but you may not be so lucky next time!

Topside Resident: Hey. You know a way to get topside other than the train?

Aerith: Sorry, can't say I do…

Topside Resident: Figured as much. What a goddard pain in the ass…

Cloud: Wait.

[A helicopter flies in. A couple of Shinra soldiers jump out of it.]

Security Officer: Deck is all clear!

Security Officer: Rope's good! Go!

Security Officer: Form up!

[A stylish bald man in sunglasses also jumps out of the helicopter. He gives commands to the other soldiers.]

Security Officer: Let's go!

[Cloud and Aerith hide behind a crate.]

Cloud: Another Turk.

Aerith: A real man on a mission.

Cloud: On the hunt, more like.

Aerith: For me? Or you?

Cloud: Don't know. Don't care.

Aerith: Then… let's stick to the backstreets? There will be monsters.

Cloud: Better than Shinra.

Aerith: There's a Shinra dump site up ahead. Not the kind of place anyone would ever choose to hang around in.

Cloud: But a great place to lay low. They've got the run of it.

Aerith: No telling where they'll come from…

Cloud: Monsters instinctively target weaker prey.

Aerith: Hmm… You'd better watch out then, Cloud. That way's a dead end. They were doing some construction, but quit halfway. Over here. 

[Cloud tries to open a gate with the switch nearby but it does nothing.]

Aerith: That didn't work. Maybe it's broken? Pretty sure this path we're on loops around, too, so… Hmm, wonder if we can move this.

[Cloud uses his superhuman strength of a SOLDIER and moves the container.]

Aerith: Ah, I knew it!

[They continue fighting their way.]

Aerith: Must've been a new breed.

Cloud: How do you figure?

Aerith: 'Cause they went for the stronger prey. There check it out! The heart of the slums.

Cloud: Still a fair ways off…

Aerith: Well, we did take a detour. Getting tired?

Cloud: Nah.

Aerith: Me, I'm feeling a bit hungry. How about you?

Cloud: Amazed.

Aerith: You're in for a treat when we make it back.

Cloud: Don't have time for that.

Aerith: You'll wanna make time for my mom's cooking. And that's the final word on it! We'll get home quick and eat ourselves stupid!

[The journey through the slums continues.]

Aerith: It's awake!

Cloud: Gonna wish it kept sleeping.

Aerith: Yeah! That should do the trick!

Aerith: Nice work! Way to think ahead.

Aerith: Guess we're home free.

Cloud: No need for thanks. I'd rather get paid.

Aerith: Hm? You're getting paid right now.

[They enter some sort of a town i nCentral District.]

Aerith: Should be able to relax a little now…

Cloud: Don't forget about the Turks. Could come at us anytime. Keep an eye out.

Aerith: What're they watching?

Cloud: Hey!

[They stop to watch a big TV on the street.]

Reporter: I'm standing inside the gutted shell of Mako Reactor 5. As you can see, there's still a lot of smoke rising from the rubble. While fallen beams and other debris continue to hinder rescue efforts, the fires appear to have been mostly extinguished. Ah, over there! That's the director of Shinra's Advanced Weaponry Division, isn't it? Excuse me, ma'am, but would you mind answering a few questions?

Scarlet: Move.

Reporter: Can you give us any updates on the status of the reactor? What kind of damage did it suffer in the explosion? Are we in any danger?

Scarlet: Mako Reactor 5 has been temporarily shut down, and all fires have been successfully extinguished. The situation is under control, and the people of our fair city need not worry about any additional complications. We are in the process of conducting a full forensic investigation. But we suspect the device used was similar to that employed in the attack on Mako Reactor 1. The perpetrators of that atrocity were filmed making their escape. These agents of the eco-terrorist group Avalanche are currently believed to be in hiding somewhere in Midgar.

Reporter: And… given that this group has now attacked two reactors in quick succession… can they really be stopped before they strike again?

Scarlet: What do you think? Have no fear. Shinra will keep Midgar safe.

Security Officer: Okay, time’s up!

Aerith: Alright… let's go.

Restaurant Owner: Aw, what timing. Mind lending me a hand?

Aerith: The place is really hopping, huh?

Restaurant Owner: Nice side effect of the train situation! So, whaddya, say? I'd love to, but… (to CLoud) I help out every now and then. It's fun.

???: Aerith!

Aerith: Well, well, what are you doing all the way up there?

???: Was trying to get a look at the reactor. Who's this guy?

Aerith: This is Cloud. He's a mercenary… and currently my bodyguard. That's Oates.

Oates: See you.

Aerith: Two peas in a pod.

Boy: Aerith. Aerith!

Aerith: So, what are you guys up to?

Girl: We all went to see the reactor.

Boy: Oh, that's right. You're supposed to come by the House.

Aerith: What for?

Girl: I dunno. You're just supposed to. 

Aerith: (to Cloud) Well, guess we have a new destination. I should probably explain.

Aerith: The Leaf House is the local orphanage. That's where all these kids live.

Girl: Hey Aerith, where'd you go?

Boy: The church again? Next time, we should all go together!

Doctor: Why hello, Aerith. As popular as ever, I see.

Aerith: Apparently. But they sure keep me on my toes!

Doctor: (laughs) Better than being bediridden! Thanks again for all those herbs. You've helped a lot of people.

Aerith: No problem. Anytime.

Doctor: How'd you manage to find so many, anyway?

Aerith: Oh, I have my ways.

Doctor: And him?

Aerith: He's my bodyguard. Just until I get home.

Doctor: And you're sure he's up to it?

Aerith: Hmmm… Maybe. (to Cloud) Since I'm so generous, I gather medicinal herbs for his patients sometimes. Here's the Leaf House.

Housemother: There you are.

Boy: We're back! And we brought Aerith with us!

Housemother: Sorry to make you come out here.

Aerith: Don't be. It's on my way home.

Housemother: Well then, I hope you won't mind me asking for some flowers.

Aerith: No problem! How many?

Housemother: All you can carry. What with all the doom and gloom wave been hearing on the news recently, I thought some flowers might help cheer everyone up.

Aerith: I'm sure they will, and I'd love to help.

Housemother: Let's all wash up before our meal.

Aerith: So, Cloud, what's your favorite flower?

Cloud: They're all the same to me.

Aerith: You sure you wanna say that to a florist?

Cloud: Better than lying.

Aerith: Okay, then what'd you do with the flower I gave you?

Cloud: I, uh…

Aerith: You give it away?

Cloud: I did.

Aerith: Ooh! To who? Tell me!

Cloud: Don't recall.

Aerith: Hmmm?

Cloud: What?

Aerith: Thought you didn't like lying.

Aerith: Well, anyway… My house is just up this path. Mom should be home by now, so I'll introduce you. There you go. That's my house.

Cloud: It's amazing.

Aerith: Come on.

Aerith: I'm home!

Elmyra: Hey baby. Been up to no good? Rude came by

Aerith: So, this is my mom, Elmyra. And this is Cloud. My bodyguard.

Cloud: Uh…hi.

Elmyra: Take good care of her?

Cloud: That's my job. Or was my job.

Aerith: Yep. Thanks. So, Cloud, you gonna head back to Sector 7?

Cloud: Yeah.

Aerith: Then I'll show you the way.

Cloud: Then why'd you have me bring you here? What if the Turks show up again?

Aerith: It'd suck, but I've dealt with them before. Honestly, I'm much more worried about you. What if you get lost, huh? You'd be too embarrassed to admit it, and so you Just keep on going.

Cloud: Quit acting like you know me.

Aerith: Hey, Mom? I'm gonna go take Cloud over to Sector 7, okay?

Elmyra: Okay… But why not wait until tomorrow? If you head out now, it'll be dark when you get back. Better to rest up here and make the trip first thing in the morning. When you'll have daylight to spare.

Aerith: That's true. She's got a point, Cloud.

Cloud: Hold up.

Aerith: Oh, yeah! I still need to deliver some flowers to the Leaf House. Since we have a little time before dinner… You should come with.

Cloud: That wasn't the deal.

Aerith: You mean you want more? Even though you've got a priceless reward coming your way? Do you know what I promised him?

Cloud: I'll do it!

Aerith: I go grab the baskets. Be right back!

Elmyra: That Aerith… She's a handful, isn't she? It must be tough—No, never mind. Hmph.

[Cloud explores the house for a while.]

Cloud: Huh…

Aerith: Found 'em! You take this one. Take it. 

[She hands Cloud an empty little basket.]

Aerith: Right. Off we go! 

[They walk out of the house to the garden outside.]

Aerith: And these, right here, are my babies. Hmm… Which ones do you think we should pick?

Cloud: Any of them.

Aerith: Aw, don't be like that. I know you have an eye for this kind of thing.

Aerith: That's the one I gave you.

Cloud: Huh. It is?

Aerith: Nice try, mister. You can't fool me. I think we still need a few more. Which should we pick next? Good eye. People used to give these to declare their loyalty to one another. Interesting, right? She said "as many as you can carry," so maybe a few more? Whoa, foxtails, huh? I gotta hand it to you, I never would've thought of that. It'll definitely take them by surprise. I think we're good now. Whaddya say? Shall we go? No need to hurry. We're not under the gun or anything.

Cloud: I'm not cut out for this crap.

Aerith: Sure you are. And when you're done, you'll be drowning in job offers.

Aerith: So how do you think they'll arrange these flowers?

Cloud: Dunno.

Aerith: Well, we'll soon find out.

[They approach Leaf House.]

Cloud: I'll wait out here.

Aerith: Oh, okay. But I might be a while. Why not check out the town?

[With nothing else to do Cloud decides to explore the shabby town.]

Weapons Vendor: "If you don't look out for yourself, no one else will." That's a lesson for life on the ground floor!

Oates: Ah!

Cloud: I remember you…

Oates: Where's Aerith?

Cloud: The Leaf House.

Item Store Owner: Hmm? You give me gil, I give you items. Later.

Chadley: Cloud! I understand you must be busy, but I hope you haven't forgotten about my research. Cloud, I've come up with the most fascinating theory. Perhaps you can lend me your assistance in gathering data to test it? Cloud, I have the most amazing news! I believe I might know how to develop summoning materia, something heretofore thought impossible. Scientists say that this materia can only be found in nature, but I may just be able to prove otherwise! And so, Cloud, turn to you. I would like to test this theory by way of my combat simulator—to wit, I want you to fight and defeat summon data in VR. I sense that you find my phrasing to be somewhat… obtuse. Please let me know when you have made your preparations.

Materia Vendor: There's nothing you can't get your hands on in this town! Materia, scrap, you name it! No materia, no life! I've got the finest collection of materia you'll find anywhere. I knew you had a keen eye.

[After that Cloud finds Aerith and Oates.]

Cloud: Is something wrong?

Aerith: You could say that. Sounds like someone spooked the kids.

Oates: Yeah, two of 'em disappeared. They ran away after this creepy guy wearing black clothes showed up.

Cloud: A Turk?

Aerith: That's what I thought, but no.

Oates: It's this guy who's always stumbling around town in a dirty robe full of holes. They say he's sick or something. Oh, and he had some kind of number tattooed on his arm.

Aerith: I don't like the sound of this. I'm gonna check it out.

Cloud: I know someone who fits that description. I'll come with.

Aerith: ‘Kay.

Oates: C'mon.

Chadley: I have to tell you that I am grateful for all of your help thus far. I've done it. I've developed a new materia! Then I invite you to ready your portable battle simulator. 

[Cloud and Aerith defeat Shiva in VR.]

Chadley: Outstanding. The Shiva summoning materiais complete. And now it's yours. Use ji as you see fit. The lady of frost is the perfect companion for a man like you, Cloud. She will prove most useful when the time comes to destroy Shinra. I look forward to receiving all of your future battle intel submissions. I hope you will continue to help me gather vital information for my research. I look forward to receiving all of your future battle intel submissions.

Oates: C'mon.

Aerith: I know this place is off-limits to grown-ups, but if we want to rescue them… well… We gotta break the rules.

Boy: Oates! You're back!

Oates: Aerith's come to help.

Aerith: Yeah, leave it to us. We'll take care of it from here.

Boy: But there are monsters out there!

Aerith: Don't worry. I've brought a superstrong friend along with me.

Cloud: I used to be a SOLDIER. So where's the guy?

Oates: I dunno. He disappeared and we can't find him.

Aerith: Right now, let's worry about the kids.

Oates: C'mon. They ran off this way. Be careful.

Aerith: Where do you think they went?

Cloud: Who knows. They're kids. Nothing to do but look all over.

Aerith: I just hope we find them in time.

[They find the kids.]

Aerith: There they are!

Cloud: And they're not alone.

Aerith: Quickly! We gotta save them!

[They find the fallen bridge. A boy and a girl stuck right in the center, on a piece of the board…]

Boy: Aerith!

Girl: Hey, Aerith!

Aerith: Hold on! We'll be right there!

Boy: Stay back!

Cloud: Careful.

Girl: Watch out! The ground's really shaky!

Boy: It's 'cause of the reactor. You can't trust your feet!

Cloud: I’ll go.

[He skillfully jumps to the kids.]

Cloud: C'mon.

[He grabs the kids and jumps back.]

Boy: Thank you.

Girl: That was cool…

Aerith: Okay. Let's head back.

Aerith: Run and hide!

Boy: That's so cool!

Girl: How did you get to be so strong!?

Aerith: Well you see, Cloud here used to be a SOLDIER!

Boy: He was?

Girl: Did you go fight in the war?

Cloud: I might've.

Boy: I'm gonna grow up to be a SOLDIER-like you.

Girl: You can't just grow up to be a SOLDIER. You gotta work at it.

Boy: Cloud thinks I'm good enough to be one. Right?

Aerith: Look at you, Mr. Popular.

Boy: That was so cool, you guys! Especially that, "Hah! Yah!"

Girl: Yeah, it was really cool when you went like, "Hah! Yah!"

Boy: You've got it all wrong. Like that.

Girl: No way! It was way faster than that! Like that.

Boy: Fine, then how about— Yeah?

Girl: Yeah! Like that.

Boy: Isn't that right, Cloud?

Girl: Isn't that right, Cloud?

Boy: Tifa, wait!

[Cloud has one of his headaches then he remembers the past.]

Cloud: Tifa…

Aerith: Tifa? What's wrong?

Cloud: Nothing.

Aerith: Is Tifa, like… your girlfriend?

Cloud: No.

Aerith: But she's someone special.

Cloud: It's not like that. More like… I don't know how to explain…

Aerith: I see…

[They return to the other kids.]

Oates: Thank you.

Aerith: From now on, if you run into trouble, promise me you'll find an adult, okay?

Oates: Okay, I will. And here. Since you're so cool. You guys are both grown-ups, but you're also one of us now. You can come and play here whenever you want.

[Suddenly a creepy man in a dark hood approaches. He groans in pain. The kids hide behind Aerith. Cloud prepares his sword.]

Aerith: Don't worry. It'll be okay.

[The hooded man falls on the ground and Aerith runs to him.]

Cloud: Wait. Hm. Not him, but looks pretty damn similar.

Aerith: Huh? There's the number… but why "2"?

Cloud: Who knows. Come to think—

[He had another headache, stronger than before. He starts hallucinating.]

Sephiroth: (in Cloud’s head) The reunion… is nothing to fear.

[The hooded man stands up and walks away.]

Aerith: Cloud? Get it together. Come on.

Cloud: You don't know who Sephiroth is… do you?

Aerith: Sephiroth, the war hero? I know he died in an accident five years ago. They said so on the news.

Cloud: Maybe they did. But I've got a feeling he's still alive.

Aerith: Oh… right. C'mon. Let's go.

Boy: My dad told me that that man, he used to be a SOLDIER when he was younger.

Oates: Hey, Cloud. I know a lot of people around here need help. When I'm out on patrol, a lot of them tell me about their problems. Do you think you might be interested in helping out?

Aerith: Well, I'm all for it! We still have plenty of time.

Cloud: I'm on the clock.

Aerith: Don't worry. I give you permission!

Oates: I always have the latest information. Come find me if you wanna know.

[They see a black girl dressed as a moogle.]

Aerith: Oh my! Is that a moogle!?

???: You can see me, kupo? Then you two must be very, very special people. In that case… Welcome to the Moogle Emporium! I'm the owner—Moggie!

Aerith: You must not be familiar with "Mog the Moogle." It's a pretty famous fairy tale. Mog wanted to bring happiness to all the moogles of the forest, so he decided to open a shop of wonders.

Moggie: That's right, kupo! I opened a store to bring happiness to the slums-like Mog! And you know, only people with the purest of hearts can even see moogles!

Cloud: Uhh… You talking 'bout me?

Moggie: Well… moogle magic isn't perfect, kupo. Anyway, we've collected all kinds of rare and wondrous goods! They can be yours if you've got enough moogle medals. But you'll need to buy a membership first! 

[Cloud buys the membership to support the kids!]

Moggie: If you find any moogle medals, you can spend them here, kupo!

Aerith: So, Moggie, what do you do with the medals we give you?

Moggie: Oh, you know what! I use them to make everyone happy! That's the duty of every moogle!

Aerith: Of course. Just like Mog the Moogle. (to Cloud) I see you're working hard, mister merc.

Cloud: Yep.

Aerith: So whaddya gonna do next?

Cloud: Keep on working hard.

Aerith: As you always do, I'm sure.

Cloud: You know, this is how I earn a living.

Aerith: Huh? Really? I thought you were just doing it for fun!

Cloud: I suppose some people do.

Aerith: Hello! I'm some people. Nice to meet you!

Oates: I'll make sure to tell everyone around that you're here to help out. That way, you might get more work.

[Cloud starts patrolling the area.]

Scared Man: Shinra weapons are on the rampage. Five of 'em, like floatin' eyeballs! I saw them wander off into the scrap, but if they come back into town, it'd be a disaster. We need someone who's willing and able to fight…

Cloud: I'll handle it.

Scared Man: You will!? Aw man, you're the best! I could hear them shouting "intruder detected" or some other nonsense when they floated off. Be careful. They looked dangerous!

[Cloud and Aerith destroy the robots.]

Scared Man: I heard, I heard! You got 'em all, right? Robots from the reactor getting lost in the slums… Must be because of the explosion up top, huh? They must've thought they were protecting the reactor, and figured I was trespassin' on their turf or something.

Cloud: Maybe.

Scared Man:Almost feel sorry for 'em, getting all lost and confused like that. Ah, what am I sayin'? Man or machine… Shinra bitches get what they deserve.

Cloud: Now hold on.

Aerith: Anyway, I think it's safe to say our work here is finished!

Aerith: If you're ever in the market for a merc again, remember: you can count on Cloud!

Scared Man: Uh, sure. And sorry about putting this on you all of a sudden. I'm really glad you were willing to help out, though! Thanks again. Actually, while you're here, I've got another favor to ask. There's this old guy who hangs out in front of the weapons shop. I think he might need your help. Would you mind talking to him?

Chadley: I have to tell you that I am grateful for all of your help thus far. I've done it. I've developed a new materia!

Weapons Vendor: Well, hey there! Got what you need to stay safe?

Old Man: Oh, I know you. You must be that mercenary. I have a problem. It's the anniversary of my wife's death, and I wanted to visit her grave. But can't because some creatures have turned the graveyard into their nest. Could you do me a favor and go there in my stead? She shouldn't be alone today.

Cloud: It'll cost you.

Old Man: That's fine, that's fine. The graveyard's right by the head of the river. But I heard they put a new gate in recently to replace the old broken one. Now that those creatures have moved in, I'm sure it's locked up tight.

Aerith: A key to the graveyard, huh? I know—why don't we ask Oates about it?

[They go to the kids.]

Oates: Wait, you're not looking for the key to the graveyard Agate, are you? Well, it's your lucky day. Our local hero swiped it from some Public Security jerks. She gave it to Moggie, so I'm guessing he's selling it for medals now. If you want the graveyard key, talk to Moggie.

Aerith: Hey, you don't happen to have a key to a graveyard, do you?

Moggie: Of course! The emporium has everything, kupo! 

[Cloud buys the key and some stuff.]

Moggie: You guys are great! Thanks to you, I've got a ton of medals, kupo! Which means I can bring happiness to a ton of people!

Cloud: Good for you.

Aerith: Hey, Cloud… maybe say it like you mean it?

Cloud: Not until I'm happy. Go on. Work your magic. Make me smile. From ear to ear.

Moggie: I'll need a lot more medals, kupo!

Aerith: Well, that won't do! C'mon, Cloud. Let's go get more!

Moggie: Good luck, guys!

[They walk past Leaf House and encounter a black woman in glasses.]

???: Oh… You're that former SOLDIER, aren't you? Cloud, was it?

Aerith: Former SOLDIER turned problem solver. Are you okay, Ms. Folia? You look upset.

Ms. Folia: Yeah! I am pretty upset. The kids are still off doing patrols, even though it's now time for their lessons. Not a single one of them has come back yet!

Aerith: Patrols? Is that a Leaf House thing? Something they do to help out?

Ms. Folia: That's right. In return for the donations we receive, the kids go around town picking up liter, running errands—that kind of thing. I don't suppose you've seen any of them, have you? You see, I have some important plans this evening, and I really need to go and get ready.

Aerith: Would you like us to go round them up?

Ms. Folia: That would be wonderful! There are five of them out on patrol right now. They all wear homemade swords on their backs, so they should be easy to spot.

Housemother: Aerith, you're back. Come, look what we've done with the flowers. Lovely, don't you think?

Aerith: Great job. It's wonderful

Housemother: Isn't it? Oh, I nearly forgot. I saw some Shinra suit walking towards your house a little while ago. He was dressed all in black. A little scary looking.

Girl: Wow, you're that SOLDIER, right? Can I ask you a super important question? I heard bad people broke the mako reactor and there's gonna be another war 'cause of it. Is that true?

Cloud: Who knows, but isn't there something else you should be worrying about right now?

Girl: I forgot about Ms. Folia's lesson! I gotta head back to the House. (runs away)

Boy: Cloud!?

Aerith: Hey there. How goes the patrol?

Boy: There's a lot more people on the streets than usual. Maybe because the reactor blew up?

Aerith: Well, you've been keeping a very sharp lookout. But don't you think you're forgetting something important?

Boy: Oh, Ms. Folia's lessons! I gotta get back to the House! (runs away)

Aerith: Hey there. How goes the patrol?

Girl: Great! I've been picking up garbage and giving people directions. Plus, I helped an old lady cross the street.

Aerith: You've been busy.

Girl: It's a normal day for me. Gotta work hard—the House depends on people's donations! Oh no, I'm late! Did you see Ms. Folia? Is she mad? I gotta go! I'm sorry! (runs away)

Boy: You scared me!

Aerith: Hey there. How goes the patrol?

Boy: I've been watching them really close. I'm trying to learn all about the business.

Aerith: You wanna open up a shop of your own someday?

Boy: Yeah, so I can earn lots of money and use it to help the House. The teachers don't like to talk about it, but we know the donations aren't enough to keep things running. …But that's a secret, okay? I'm not supposed to tell anyone! Anyway, I gotta go study! (runs away)

Aerith: Hey, my house is this way.

Boy: Hello, Cloud—Sir! It's a real honor to meet you! I think you SOLDIER guys are awesome! I wanna be strong and tough when I grow up too!

Aerith: You sound very determined.

Boy: These are dangerous times! A reactor blew up, and a bunch of kids lost their friends and families. Who knows what might blow up next?

Aerith: I guess that means more children might be coming to the House soon.

Boy: Then I think the teachers are gonna have a whole lot more work to do.

Cloud: Speaking of teachers, Ms. Folia is looking for you.

Boy: Oh man, I completely forgot! I have to get back right now!

Aerith: That's everyone, Let's go back to the House.

[They return to Leaf House.]

Ms. Folia: The children finally came back-thanks to you iwo. You've been a great help. Okay, everyone! Come inside it's time to hit the books!

Boy: You guys, the toad king's back! I saw him near the hideout!

Boy: We gotta do something about him.

Aerith: The "toad king"?

Boy: A weird, creepy monster we've seen near the hideout lately.

Girl: He wears a crown and walks around like he owns the place. If he's not a king, he's gotta be monster royalty at least. I bet a SOLDIER could beat him up easy!

Cloud: Oh, yeah. Real casy. But here's the thing I don't work for free—or cheap.

Girl: But we don't have any money!

Girl: The watch wouldn't ask for money.

Boy: But if we ask any other grown-ups for help, they'll find out about the hideout, and that'll be it!

Girl: We really don't wanna lose the hideout. C'mon, help us! Oh and we'll give you some cool treasure if you do!

Boy: And if that's not enough, I'll pay the rest of your fee once I open my shop!

Boy: Well if you won't help, then we'll just have to kill it ourselves!

Cloud: I'll do it for three gil. I'm offering a special discount right now on toad king jobs. Looks like it's your lucky day.

Boy: Awesome! Now that's my kind of bargain!

[Cloud defeats the King.]

Boy: Did you defeat the toad king!?

Cloud: Yup. Kicked his butt real good.

Boy: Awesome! I knew you could do it!

Boy: Now we don't have to worry about the king and his smelly friends!

Girl: Thank you so much! Here this is for you the treasure we promised. It's definitely worth at least three gil.

Ms. Folia: Okay, kids, playtime's over for now! I've prepared a special assignment for everyone. One that I expect you to finish today. Understood?

Boy: Yes! Yes, Ms. Folia!

Ms. Folia: I appreciate you getting rid of the toad king, by the way.

Aerith: Wow, Ms. Folia. You must know all their secrets.

Ms. Folia: Oh, if only. Easier said than done. They're always on the move, looking for new adventures, chasing new dreams, all while trying to make the lives of everyone around them just a little bit better. I try to make sure they don't stumble and fall, and when they finally do, I help them back up.

Cloud: Sounds exhausting.

Ms. Folia: Sometimes it is. But I want the children to know that until they can stand on their own two feet, that I'm here to support them, care for them, love them—that even if we're not actually related, we're still a family a real family, in all the ways that matter. If I can do that for ther, then well… then maybe I'm making this world a better place.

Aerith: I know you are.

Ms. Folia: My predecessor taught me everything I know. I just look up his torch and ran with it, I guess. Not that I'm anything close to what he was. Biggs is one of a kind. Oh no! I've completely lost track of time!

Aerith: Do you have somewhere you need to be?

Ms. Folia: More like a dream I need to fulfill! Thank you again for your help! (leaves)

Aerith: I wonder what kind of dream she's chasing tonight.

Cloud: No idea.

Boy: Thanks again for saving our hideout from the king. In return, I let everyone know you guys can join the game as special guests. If you wanna know more, then come to the hideout!

Aerith: It feels good to help people out, doesn't it?

Cloud: Eh.

Aerith: You having fun yet?

Cloud: Heaps.

Aerith: Then you can't be afraid to show it more. Don't forget, it's all about service and salesmanship.

Cloud: I'll leave that to you.

Aerith: All right, but don't think you can rely on me forever, mister.

Cloud: Wasn't planning to.

Aerith: That's good. 'Cause I command a very good salary.

[They go to the graveyard.]

Aerith: This must be it. Hey. You wanna say a prayer too?

Cloud: No thanks. I think you've got it covered.

Scared Man: I'm really grateful for what you did, Here's your reward. I owe him a lot—maybe more than I can ever repay. And now I owe you a lot too. I know it's not much, but I hope it makes up for it a little bit.

Aerith: We paid our respects to your wife—and we took care of those creatures.

Old Man: Oh, that's such a relief to hear, I can't tell you how much it was weighing on my mind. I was beginning to think I might never be able to visit her grave again. With my bad back and my legs my whole body's a mess, frankly—I… I didn't think I could make it past the creatures. But I was prepared to die trying. And then you two came along. Still, I've got to face facts. Creatures or no, I can't keep making these trips…

Scared Man: Don't say that.

Cloud: This is the graveyard key. Run it back to Moggie.

Old Man: But… I just told you about my legs…

Scared Man: Why don't you just give it back?

Cloud: Okay. It'll cost you five thousand gil though.

Scared Man: Five thousand!

Old Man: It's always money with you people! Fine! I won't ask you for anything else! I'll take your damned key and give it to the boy! It's downright depressing. What is the world coming to these days… Money! That's all you kids think about. Not a whit of generosity or selflessness. May as well keep working till the day I die!

Scared Man: You're a real dick, you know that? But on the bright side, it seems he's all fired up again. I don't know if you knew, but he used to offer free lessons to all the street kids in the neighborhood. And yeah, I was one of those street kids. You're a real dick, you know that? 

Old Man: Maybe it's not too late for kids to learn that life's about more than just money!

Weapons Vendor: What'll it be for you today? Take care of my equipment, you hear?

Oates: Now that things are starting to settle down a bit, we can finally play Whack-a-Box again! It's all thanks to you! Oh, yeah, I forgot. There's this tired-looking guy out by the community center… and I heard he was looking for some help.

Sarah: Oh hey, Cloud! You're just in time for our favorite game-Whack-a-Box! You want in? It's super fun! The rules are easy. The person who whacks the most boxes is crowned champion of the hideout! We usually don't let adults play, but since you're cool, we're gonna make a special exception just for you.

[Cloud beats the game with ease!]

Sarah: Holy cow! You crushed it! See? Pretty fun, right? Play with us again, 'kay! Only one way to become a Whack-a-Box master: whack, whack, whack!

Item Store Owner: You're that merc, aren't you? See ya.

[Cloud approaches a man in a business suit.]

???: Ah, you wouldn't happen to be a certain merc that's become the talk of the town?

Cloud: Yup.

Damon: I'm Damon. Little more than a humble reporter with the Daily Buzz.

Aerith: Ugh, that rag? The one that's always printing awful rumors about the slums?

Damon: On the contrary, my dear! We strive to raise awareness of the plight of our undercity brethren. We seek a better future for everyone, rich and poor. Now then, my friends. I find myself in need of your exceptional services for a trifling matter. Are you familiar with the mysterious and notorious bandit known as the "Angel of the Slums"? She delivers written declarations to her victims—usually Shinra associates—before divesting them of their valuables.

Aerith: Everyone knows her. Everything she steals, she gives to the poor and needy.

Damon: Yes. She's got a knack for public relations. Very popular down here as a result. Nevertheless, she is a criminal and a threat to the public order! I've made it my mission to unmask the villain, but the locals have been uncooperative and uncommunicative, to put it mildly. And now that my identity as a reporter has been exposed, my sources have all deserted me! Which brings me to you—the merc of the hour, and the man who will serve up my scoop!

[Cloud sighs and asks around.]

Undercity Resident: Why, hello! What is it? The Guardian Angel of the Slums? Such a mysterious figure. Always talked about, but never seen by anyone! The Angel gets in and out without being noticed and always leaves a calling card. Maybe a magician!?

Undercity Resident: No, no, it's no magic trick—it's genuine magic! Rumor has it that the Angel is a witch.

Undercity Resident: If we're going by rumors, then I've heard that it's actually a monster in disguise.

Undercity Resident: Well, I could talk all day about the dozens of stories I've heard!

Undercity Resident: What's that? The Guardian Angel of the Slums? Come to think of it, a reporter came sniffin' around askin' about her—you his man? Ha! Even if I knew something, I wouldn't tell you. To folks around here, the Angel is a hero! I ain't sellin', her out to Shinra!

Undercity Resident: What? Do I know the Guardian Angel of the Slums? Well I don't know much, but I do know she doesn't steal from the poor and she doesn't kill anyone either. Far as I'm concerned that's all I need to know. If that's not enough for ya, the one you oughta talk to is Mireille. Ask anyone and they'll tell ya she knows everything about everyone around here.

Aerith: Good to see you again, Mireille.

Mireille: Good to see you too, Aerith. I'd heard you found yourself a funny new friend.

Aerith: Cloud, meet Mireille. She knows everything there is to know about the slums. Mireille, meet Cloud. He's a former SOLDIER and super strong.

Mireille: He looks useful enough. The kids have been talking about you. The defender of the secret hideout. And now the Hero of the Leaf House is helping the Daily Buzz look for the Angel of the Slums.

Cloud: I am?

Mireille: I'm a lover of the whispered word. Not that it's any real secret, considering how chatty that Shinra mutt's been.

Cloud: Not looking into it for the reporter. I'm doing it for myself. Call it curiosity… or whatever.

Mireille: Or could it be you've fallen under the Angel's spell like so many others? Anyway—it so happens that I have some information for you. But I need a moment before I can give it to you. Why don't you wait with that reporter of yours?

Damon: So! Any news?

Aerith: Have you tried talking to Mireille at all? She told us that she had some information to share.

Damon: Mireille as in the Mireille? The town gossip? I chased her for days, begging for info, but she wouldn't give up a single scrap! So how'd you get the old bird to talk?

Mireille: This old bird had a change of heart, that's all.

Damon: Then quickly, before you have another, tell us: what do you know about the notorious Angel of the Slums? Has she struck again? Is that it!?

Mireille: I don't know anything about that. But I do know where her hideout is.

Damon: Her base of operations? Now that's a scoop! Where is it!? Tell me!

Mireille: Deep in the scrap at Lookout Point. Hardly anyone goes out there these days. It's the perfect place for a criminal to hole up.

Damon: Lookout Point—got it! I'll check it out right now!

Mireille: But before you go, I should warn you about this rumor I heard about a terrible fiend that's claimed the Angel's hideout as its lair. Quite large, lots of teeth, always hungry. I don't know about you, but I'd not go anywhere near that thing.

Damon: Er well, uh… Well! A good reporter knows never to take foolish risks. “Plan first, then act.” That's every respectable journalist's motto!

Mireille: If it's a "plan" you're looking for, I'd say you have one right here. Wouldn't you?

Damon: So, my good mercenary. If I might impose upon you again, it would be lovely if you investigated Lookout Point for me.

[Cloud go investigate and defeat a giant robot made of junk.]

Cloud: Okay then. Guess we should look around.

[He picked up a note.]

Cloud: "The Guardian Angel of the Slums will collect your offering on behalf of the poor."

Aerith: This must be one of her calling cards!

Cloud: I don't see anything else interesting. Let's head back and tell them what we found.

Damon: I can't believe it! You found one of her calling cards! This is the genuine article, I'm sure of it! Penned by the Angel herself!

Mireille: Hmm… So this is one of her famous warnings.

Damon: It's an incredible find! Oh was that all?

Mireille: Hold on. Looks like there's something else—a message. "To the nosy Shinra reporter sniffing around… I was planning to teach you a lesson you would never forget. However, by the grace of your mercenary friend, you were spared that lesson. But next time he might not be around to save you. You would be wise to watch your step."

Damon: Not just a message from the Angel… A warning!

Mireille: If the merc here hadn't bailed you out, that fiend in the scrap would've ripped you to shreds. Sorry about that, friend. Here I was just trying to help you out, but instead my kindness almost got you violently killed.

Damon: Now, now. No harm, no foul… right? In any case, I hope this narrowly averted tragedy won't discourage you from sharing information with me in the future.

Undercity Resident: Hey, everybody! The Angel left another calling card! She's gonna rip off Don Corneo!

Undercity Resident: It's about damn time!

Undercity Resident: Don Corneo's no easy mark. I can't wait to see how this goes down!

Damon: Excuse me! I'm a reporter for the Daily Buzz and—

Cloud: So much for my reward.

Mireille: Here. Why don't you take this? Oh, and no need to thank me. Let's just say it slipped out of that reporter's pocket. Can't call it theft if you're just claiming what you're owed—am I right? Well done, mister merc. You certainly lived up to your reputation.

Aerith: We probably oughta call it a day.

Cloud: Getting late, huh?

Aerith: You've been working so hard, you lost track of time.

Cloud: Had to. The pay sucked.

Aerith: 'Cause they didn't know if you were worth it yet. But now they do. C'mon. Let's go home.

[But on the way home they met the bald guy in the back suit!]

Rude: Hello, Aerith.

Aerith: What do you want?

Rude: Haven't seen him before. He your new boy toy?

Aerith: He's my bodyguard, if you must know.

Rude: Wait a minute… Those eyes… Is he the one who beat up Reno?

Cloud: And what if I am?

Rude: Need to cross my T's, dot my I's. That's all.

[He prepares for a fight.]

Aerith: Cloud, leave him be. Rude's not a bad person. Really.

Rude: No, I'm not bad. But like it or not… I sometimes have to do bad things. Don't take it personal.

Cloud: You Turks are all the same. All bark… no bite.

Rude: You're one to talk!

Aerith: No need to get rough!

[The fight begins!]

Cloud: Stay back.

Rude: Gotta get a little payback for my partner.

Cloud: Come on then.

[Cloud breaks Rude’s glasses.]

Rude: Okay then.

Aerith: So, you had enough yet?

Rude: No, I don't believe that I have.

[He pulls out another pair of glasses and continues fighting.]

Aerith: Just stop it.

Rude: Can't. It's my job.

Cloud: Then think about changing careers.

Aerith: Cloud's pretty strong, isn't he?

Rude: I've seen his type before.

Cloud: You don't know me. How's that payback working out for ya?

Rude: Oh, better than expected. I thought you didn't wanna get rough.

Aerith: No… but this is self-defense! Please. Just leave us alone.

Rude: You know I can't do that.

[Someone calls Rude in the middle of the fight!]

Reno: Hey there, partner. I'm sure you're having the time of your life, but we're needed on standby for a job. Something about Sector 7. So get your ass back here now.

Rude: Understood.

Aerith: Got somewhere else to be?

Rude: …Apparently so.

[A helicopter flies in.]

Rude: Go home and stay there.

Aerith: You know I can't go that!

[Rude jumps in the helicopter and flies away. Cloud and Aerith walk home.]

Aerith: Wait a sec. So… you coming?

Cloud: You talking to the…

[Aerith shushes Cloud, squats down and looks at the flowers.ith ]

Aerith: So yeah… It was that kind of day. Let's go. Shouldn't keep Mom waiting.

Cloud: Hey… What'd they say?

Aerith: "Good work today, guys." Kidding. They didn't say a word. But you know… Ah… never mind. It's not like you'd believe me after all.

Cloud: …Probably not. Tell me anyway.

Aerith: Really?

Cloud: Yeah.

Aerith: It won't be much longer now. The flowers, they… they have something important to tell us. Something they… need to share with us. At least, that's the feeling I get. But before they can… there's a final step that has to be taken. Otherwise… we won't hear them. Maybe I should just give up. Honestly, it's what I do best.

Cloud: Could've fooled me. From what I've seen, you're no quitter.

Aerith: Well today's special! That's why I've been working my butt off!

Cloud: …What's so special about it?

Aerith: Okay, time to go!

Cloud: Learn to talk to her.

Aerith: Did the flowers say anything?

Cloud: Uh… "Good work today, guys"?

Aerith: That's the spirit!

[Cloud goes straight to home to get some well deserved rest!]

Aerith: You're heading in already?

Cloud: Yeah. That's enough for one day.

Elmyra: Where have you two been? I've been worried sick!

Aerith: Sorry. We got a little sidetracked.

Elmyra: Dinner's ready, in case you're wondering.

Aerith: Ah, great!

Elmyra: But before we sit down I want you to make up the guest room.

Aerith: Gotcha! Take a load off, okay? (goes upstairs)

Elmyra: Judging by those eyes, I'm guessing you're a SOLDIER?

Cloud: Ex-SOLDIER.

Elmyra: I hate to ask… but would you leave tonight? Without any fuss no questions? You boys made a trade a normal life for power. You can't have it both ways.

Aerith: I'm back!

Elmyra: Good. Now I hope you're hungry.

Aerith: Starving. Right?

[After dinner Cloud lays on a bed and thinks… or maybe he already asleep.]

Claudia: I've never been so proud. The man you've become… Women must be hounding you day and night.

Cloud: Not really.

Claudia: You know, there's all kinds of temptations in the big city. I'd feel a lot better if I knew you'd found a good girl-one who'd make sure you didn't get into trouble.

Cloud: I can take care of myself.

Claudia: An older, more mature girl that could keep you on the straight and narrow and tell you when you're being a silly goose. That's the perfect type for you, I'd say.

[He wakes up pretty early. It’s still dark outside.]

Cloud: Don't want to overstay my welcome.

[He leaves his room and Aerith immediately walks out hers, fully dressed.]

Aerith: What're you doing?

Cloud: …Nothing.

Aerith: Did you have a bad dream? Don't worry. You'll feel much better in the morning.

Aerith: And I promise to take you straight home.

Cloud: Uh… Okay.

[He tries to leave one more time.]

Cloud: Please don't let her hear me again.

Aerith: You jerk! I thought I told you not to leave your room. Now get back in there!

Cloud: Okay…

[Third time a charm.]

Elmyra: You're leaving?

Cloud: So, how do I get to Sector 7?

Elmyra: It's simple enough. Just cut through Sector 6. It isn't exactly safe, bui you should be okay, seeing as you're a SOLDIER.

Cloud: Was one.

Elmyra: Promise me. You'll never talk to Aerith again. Please.

Cloud: You got it.

Elmyra: Thank you. I'm sorry.

[He leaves the house. On the way to Sector 6 he encounters… Aerith.]

Aerith: Well, look who it is. Talk about a coincidence.

Cloud: What're you doing here?

Aerith: Waiting. Because I'm not sick of you yet.

Cloud: Lead on, then.

Chapter 9: The Town That Never Sleeps
Aerith: With pleasure. 

[She’s humming and hop forward and Cloud has another of his headaches. He remembers something and unwillingly shed a tear.]

Aerith: Cloud? Is something wrong?

Cloud: It's nothing.

[They run forward.]

Cloud: You can see the sky.

Aerith: They're still working on the new plate. I don't like this part of Midgar. Back when they were still building Midgar, there was an accident, and the plate fell. People had only just started moving in, so there weren't a lot living there at the time, but…

[Cloud points at a city in the distance.]

Cloud: And that's…?

Aerith: The underside of Sector 6. "Wall Market." A real special place. But… I'm sure you already knew that, right?

Cloud: I didn't tell you? I enlisted pretty much right after I left home. Dunno much about this place, or any of the slums.

Aerith: Well, it took a lot of people to build Midgar. And they all needed to blow off steam. So some traders built an entertainment district. Inns, shops, bars, the works. Folks started pouring in from all over. Business was booming, money was flowing… Which attracted the attention of some guys who… didn't much care for the law.

Cloud: And now there isn't any.

Aerith: Right. But instead of trying to solve the problem, the government decided to just wall it in. And that's how Wall Market began. "Out of sight, out of mind," as the old saying goes. For the folks in charge, there's no better way to deal with it.

Cloud: So it's like a giant veil.

Aerith: Yeah. Wanna see what's behind it?

Cloud: Not really.

Aerith: That's good 'cause I know a better way to get to Sector 7. One that tragically doesn't go through Wall Market. And it's just through this tunnel here. At least it was, back when I was a kid.

[They go through a collapsed building to a half destroyed expressway.]

Aerith: It's been like this, you know. Ever since the plate fell.

Cloud: And there's no other way?

Aerith: It'll be an adventure.

[They fight their way to a collapsed part.]

Cloud: What's that?

Aerith: A big arm. Kinda cute, don't you think? Oh, great. Someone's pulled up the ladder. I wonder if we can use this.

[Cloud uses a control panel to move the arm.]

Aerith: Cloud! Here's an idea. I'll hop on, and you give me a ride.

Cloud: You serious?

Aerith: Absolutely! I'll throw down the ladder for you to climb up after. Piece of cake! Gimme a sec. And here comes the ladder. Well? What did I tell ya? You did it! Hm? Alright, good enough.Let's keep on truckin'!

[They continue fighting.]

Cloud: Stop.

Aerith: Did we wake it up? Huh, that's weird. Used to be a way through here. I wonder if someone blocked it off because of all the monsters that kept showing up

Cloud: Pretty dangerous place for kids to play.

Aerith: Raised in the slums, remember?

Cloud: You're tough.

Aerith: Hmm, that supposed to be a compliment? Hey, I bet you can grab that container with the arm. Not half bad! So, do you moonlight as a crane operator or something? Yeah? Uhhh… Aw, no. Look. Why's it always gotta be so tough? Lucky for me, you'll make this easier.

Cloud: Yes, ma'am.

Aerith: Well then, I'm gonna head down. Hold on a second. Gotcha! Okay, right there! Hold on while I drop the ladder! Cloud, over here! Whoa. Not too fast, okay?

Cloud: Got it.

[Exploring ruins they find a big room.]

Aerith: Anybody around? Guess it's just us.

[Cloud finds a campfire.]

Cloud: It's still warm.

Aerith: Should we relight it? Have our own campfire?

Cloud: I need to get back. Besides—

[Three masked creepy looking guys appears!]

Beck: Lookie here, boys! Caught us some burglars!

Burke: Comin' into our homes and stealing our shit doin' crimes!

Beck: I'd say we're owed "compensatory damages"!

Butch: Yeah! Complementary—uh, composite—Uh, I don't get it.

Beck: How stupid can you be? It's crazy simple! Compensatory damages is like, uh… It's like… compensation… For damages!

Burke: Oh yeah! That's what you get when you…no, when somebody else! Uh…

Cloud: We haven't done anything wrong.

Aerith: Yeah. We were just passing through.

Burke: Ohhh? A likely story.

Aerith: Okay, what do you want?

Beck: Nothing but our due recompense that's all!

Butch: Wait… what? Do wreck-em-pants!?

Beck: No, shit-for-brains! "Due recompense"! It's like… uh… It's like… uh… Compensatory damages!

Butch: Oh! So damage is recompense! I get it!

Beck: Simple as that!

Aerith: I think we've heard enough.

[Cloud and Aerith pull out their weapons and kick their sorry asses. The trio lies on the ground pretending to be dead.]

Beck: Okay, guys. Whatever you do… don't move…

Burke: Don't look… Just don't look…

Butch: I'm dead… I'm super dead…

[Cloud and Aerith continue their journey.]

Aerith: Random question, but… why did you quit being a SOLDIER?

Cloud: That is random.

Aerith: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Um, did you have any SOLDIER friends? Any war buddies?

Cloud: No… not really.

Aerith: Oh, okay.

[They stumble upon another bandit.]

Bandit: Huh!? What we got here? Fresh meat to test our new toy on, that's what!

[After defeating him they continue.]

Aerith: Stupid ladders. Always out of reach…. Okay Cloud, heading down. You're in charge of the arm, got it? Cloud! Gotcha. Thanks for the lift! I'll have that ladder down for you in a sec! That went pretty well.

Cloud: Sure did.

Aerith: Hm? Wait a minute, did you just…?

Cloud: Nope.

Aerith: Don't worry, we'll be on the same page next time.

Cloud: What are you talking about?

Aerith: I'm sorry, okay!

Bandit: Hold it right there, lovebirds! You wanna pass through our territory, then you gotta pay the toll!

Aerith: We made it! Smell the fresh air? Cloud. Up top.

[Cloud unwillingly high five her. They got to Evergreen Park.]

Aerith: Alright, there it is. The gate to Sector 7.

Cloud: Looks shut. How do we open it?

Aerith: More importantly, how about we take a break? Sound good?

Cloud: No. I don't have time for—

Aerith: Up there looks nice. C'mon!

[Cloud sighs and follows Aerith.]

Aerith: You know, a long time ago, I used to sell flowers here.

Cloud: Oh yeah?

[They sit next to each other.]

Aerith: So, Cloud… You were a SOLDIER: First Class, right?

Cloud: Yeah.

Aerith: Weird.

Cloud: Really? What's weird about it?

Aerith: Nothing. Just that you were the same rank.

Cloud: Huh? As who?

Aerith: The first guy I ever loved.

Cloud: What's his name? I probably know him.

[Aerith speaks the name silently and Cloud gets another headache.]

Aerith: Are you okay?

Aerith: Wow… Your eyes.

Cloud: Oh. It's 'cause of the mako. All SOLDIERs have 'em.

Aerith: Yeah… I know. Sorry, I'm bumming you out. We should go. Gotta look forward, not back.

[She leads cloud to a secret entrance on a playground]

Aerith: Here. This won't take long.

[She pushes back the manhole cover.]

Aerith: Ready! Wanna get to Sector 7 in style? This is the passageway for you.

Cloud: & Aerith: So…

Aerith: Go ahead.

Cloud: You gonna be okay getting home?

Aerith: And if I said I wasn't?

Cloud: I'll go with you.

Aerith: Thought you needed to get back? Don't worry. I have a backup route for emergencies. And it's safer too. Guess this is it, then. Ready?

Cloud: No.

Aerith: Aww, you big softie. Gonna miss me? Shall we?

Cloud: Yeah.

[Suddenly the huge gate opens and a carriage pulled by a chocobo rides out. Tifa sits in it dressed in a traditional Japanese kimono with flowers in her hair. Cloud runs up to her.]

Cloud: Tifa?

Tifa: Cloud! You're alive! I thought we'd lost you!

Cloud: What's going on?

Tifa: I'll explain everything later. But now, I'm on my way to see Don Corneo. You should head back to Seventh Heaven, meet up with the gang.

Cloud: But—

Tifa: I'll be fine. You've seen how much ass I can kick.

Cloud: I have…

[The carriage drives away.]

Aerith: Oh no you don't. You're going after her.

Cloud: She's a big girl. She can handle the likes of him. And worse.

Aerith: Uh-uh. You don't know Corneo. It doesn't matter how strong or smart you think you are. He'll find a way to turn it against you. And where's she going to meet him? A mansion filled with his goons. Come on. Aren't you worried what might happen in there? You have to help her!

[The gates slowly close.]

Aerith: Come on!

Cloud: Okay.

[They run after the carriage.]

Aerith: Come on, Cloud. We gotta hurry!

[They walk up to a guy dressed in Red Dead Redemption style.]

Stablehand: Hey there! Where you headed?

Aerith: You gave a ride to a girl earlier. Do you have any idea where she went?

Stablehand: No, and if you don't need a ride, then get the hell outta here. Can't you see I'm trying to work?

Cloud: Can't say I can, no.

Stablehand: What'd you say to me, you little—

[A house nearby opens and another cowboy comes out. His voice reminded me a lot of Sam Elliott, but this character is voiced by a different actor.]

Sam: What's all the ruckus out here? Hmm… I don't know you. What's your story?

Aerith: We're looking for a girl who took one of your carriages. Can you help us find her?

Sam: Depends. What d’you want with this girl of yours?

Cloud: Guess. We want to save

Aerith: Save her from a life without this handsome guy!

Sam: So that's how it is, huh? Well, I get a lotta customers. Hard to keep track of 'em all. This girl, what's she look like? 
Cloud: Well… 

She's in great shape.
She's a great fighter. 
She's great at handling the books. ✓

Cloud: She's… great at handling the books.

Aerith: Cloud, I really don't think that'll help.

Sam: Wait a minute, you talking about Tifa?

Cloud: That's her.

Sam: Oho, looks like someone's got a bit of a crush! Hate to break your heart, kid, but it's gonna be a long while before she sees the light of day again.

Cloud: What do you mean?

Sam: She's a real pretty girl. Corneo's hosting another audition, and Tifa was chosen as a candidate.

Aerith: An audition for what?

Sam: For the title of the next Mrs. Corneo. She's what he likes, all rolled into one sweet package. Having scouted girls for so long, I know his tastes better than my own. And considering those tastes, I can guarantee you this: she won't be walking out of that mansion anytime soon… if at all.

Cloud: So where can we find this Don Corneo?

Sam: What're you asking for? Thinking of raising holy hell or something? Do what you gotta, but leave me out of it. I told you what you wanna know now take a walk. (leaves)

Aerith: And there goes our best lead yet. Maybe we'll have better luck in town. Let's check it out.

Barker: Welcome to Wall Market, the pleasure capital of Midgar that's got everything for everybody! Couple, huh? Stall good! Play together, do your own thing—earn a little scratch on the side, even—whatever you're into, we got you. Got a special onetime limited offer—

Aerith: No, thank you! Come on, Cloud let's go!

Barker: So, what kind of mischief you looking to get up to tonight?

Pharmacist: Hey there. We're a pharmacy, but we stock other stuff too. Thanks a bunch.

Materia Vendor: See the sign out front? All I got is materia. Thanks, buddy.

Cowgirl: I can't believe I bought the same disc twice. Excuse me, sir. If you like, you can have it.

Receptionist: My apologies, sir. We are not ready to open at this time.

Honeygirl: …What?

Cloud: Aren't you that Leaf House?

Ms. Folia: Hey! What the hell, merc!? Digging into people's personal affairs in this town is a huge no-no!

Cloud: What are you doing here?

Ms. Folia: Well, if you must know… I've wanted to be a dancer ever since I was a little girl! I come here at night to live the dream. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell the children, okay? I've always wanted to dance for a living. I practice every second I can. It's the only way I'll become the best!

[Cloud continues to explore the surroundings.]

Undercity Resident: Hey. You hear 'bout that real narrow street just over there…?

Undercity Resident: You're not still wasting your gil at the Honeybee Inn, are ya?

Undercity Resident: You bet I am. Found me a secret route in, one nobody don't know about. Only trouble is, it's filled with drunks 'n' garbage!

Undercity Resident: That guy over there, he, uh… he doin' all right, you think?

Undercity Resident: He's fine. Just drunk

Undercity Resident: Like the rest of 'em, am I right?

Patient: That scent… I can't stand it… Ack… Erg…

Chadley: Cloud! I will go wherever my research leads me, but the success of my endeavors rests entirely upon you. Your assistance would be much appreciated. Cloud, I've come up with the most fascinating theory. Perhaps you can lend me your assistance in gathering data to test it? Cloud, I've registered a new summons battle intel request. Please take a look. I need you to defeat the summoned entity so I can complete the materia.

Chadley: I have to tell you that I am grateful for all of your help thus far. I've done it. I've developed a new materia! I hope you will continue to help me gather vital information for my research. Then I invite you to ready your portable battle simulator.

[Cloud puts on the VR goggles again and immerses himself in virtual battles.]

Chadley: Extraordinary! Every fight brings me one step closer to understanding you. You are a mystery I simply cannot wait to solve. That was unfortunate…but remember your limitations are only in your mind. I look forward to receiving all of your future battle intel submissions. I hope you will continue to help me gather vital information for my research.

[Cloud notices a thoughtful young man outside a place with promiscuous ladies.]

Johnny: Warmth, relaxation, the sweet embrace of pretty ladies! That's what I need! To enter, or not to enter. That is the question. Wherefore does this philosophical quandary torment, ьe!? You totally get where I'm coming from, right?

Yeah. ✓
No.

Johnny: Hah! I knew it! Lemme guess after you've had your fun, you fall into a spiral of shame and self-loathing. But it only lasts a moment, doesn't it? Next thing you know, you're right back here again… Huh? Gotta question for me?

Cloud: Seen Tifa around?

Johnny: Tifa? My love, miy light!? Who are you, and how do you know her!? No, shut up. I don't care! Tifa's here? Why!? Tell me, why! Oh god, no, I did this to her, didn't I. She came looking for me, to beg me not to leave her! Snap out of it, Johnny. Your Tifa needs you! Tifa—I'm coming, baby! (runs away)

Aerith: Who was that…?

Cloud: Nobody you want or need to know.

[They walk on and, after crossing a bridge in the traditional Japanese style, come to a large mansion with a sign 古留根 and enter it. Inside, they find something resembling a poorly organized warehouse and three young men standing at the far door.]

Aerith: Check it out! I think we might've found our man…and he's a gaudy one.

Cloud: Yeah…

Leslie: Not so fast, buddy. Back it up. Got no need for pretty boys here.

Cloud: We're looking for someone.

Leslie: Lemme guess. First time in Wall Market.

Cloud: Yeah, so?

Leslie: So people can't just walk through the don's front door. Especially men.

Aerith: How 'bout me, then? Can I go inside?

Leslie: Maybe, but you're gonna wish you didn't.

Corneo Lackey: Y'know, Leslie, she's kinda cute. Homely, but cute.

Aerith: Excuse you?

Leslie: "Kinda cute" is not gonna cut it.

Aerith: Come on, can't you help us out?

Leslie: Do you have any idea what you're getting yourself into?

Cloud: Aerith.

Corneo Lackey: Seriously, Les, she's not half bad! With a little work, bet she'd clean up real nice.

Aerith: Cloud… requesting permission to kill.

Cloud: Denied.

Leslie: If you're really sure you wanna join an audition, then you're gonna need to get official approval.

Aerith: And who can give us that?

Leslie: The Trio the only ones in town who're considered authorities on Corneo's particular tastes. First, there's Chocobo Sam. And then there's Madam M, over at the massage parlor. Last but not least, there's the Honeybee Inn's Andrea Rhodea. They're an eccentric bunch, to put it mildly, and you should know they don't recommend just any girl stupid enough to come knocking.

Aerith: Hmm, duly noted. Thanks for the info. We'll be back soon.

[Cloud and Aerith leave the building.]

Cloud: Aerith. You sure about this?

Aerith: If you've got any better ideas.

Cloud: Not really.

Johnny: So that's the way it is, hmm? Tifa's been invited into the don's estate…

Aerith: Huh?

Johnny: But! To earn such a privilege, you must first win the approval of one of the Trio. Right? Meaning! I now know what I must do to save her! Stay strong, Tifa! Help is on the way! Johnny's comin', baby! (runs away again)

Aerith: Not the sharpest tool in the shed, is he?

Cloud: Nope.

[They run into town.]

Pharmacist: I have a decent selection. Take a look why don't you? See ya around. Everything I sell’s legal. Nothing shady. You got everything you need?

Johnny: You should've known better. Always go with your gut!

Barker: You gotta let go of your inhibitions and set yourself free!

[Cloud and Aerith go to the chocobo farm.]

Sam: Not you two again. Told you once, I'll tell you a thousand times got nothin' for you. Now scram.

Aerith: Wait, hear us out. You're one of the Trio, right? I want you to get me into the audition.

Sam: Huh?

Aerith: Pretty please?

Sam: Why not.

Aerith: Really!?

Sam: Sure. Next time an audition comes round, I'll put your name in the hat.

Aerith: Next time will be too late. Can't you get me into this one?

Sam: You want in now? No can do, sweetheart. I already recommended Tifa, and she's got this in the bag.

Aerith: How can you be so sure Corneo will pick Tifa? You never know. He might pick me.

Sam: Damn, you really do want in, don't you?

Aerith: Sure do!

Sam: Then how's about we play for it? 

[He takes out a gold coin and tosses it, then catches it and clutches it in his hand.]

Sam: Call it, missy. Heads or tails. Guess right, and I'll grant you your wish. Guess wrong, and you'll leave me in peace. Heads. Tails. No deal.

Heads. ✓
Tails.
No deal.

Cloud: Heads.

Sam: Tails. You lose.

[Cloud and Aerith sigh in frustration at such an outcome.]

Sam: Hey, don't look so glum. You're a pretty enough gal, just… not quite Corneo's cup of tea. But if only the don will do, try convincing one of the other two. That's why it's the Trio and not just the me-oh. Now skedaddle.

[He turns around and walks away.]

Cloud: Wait. Mind if I see that coin of yours?

[Sam tosses him his coin. Cloud looks at it.]

Cloud: Trick coin. I had a hunch.

Aerith: That's cheating!

Cloud: And that's the Wall Market way. Lesson learned.

Aerith: Still cheating.

[They take the coin for themselves and leave.]

Aerith: Why don't we try looking for another one of the Trio?

[They walk down neon-lit alleyways filled with people having fun and come out to an establishment that looks like a nightclub.]

Cloud: This the place?

Aerith: Think so.

Cloud: Lemme handle this. You wait out here, okay?

Aerith: And why would I do that? No, I'm coming with.

Cloud: I'm not really sure that—

Aerith: You're a man of many talents, but "talking" isn't one of them.

[They enter the establishment. They see that all the girls working here are dressed like bees. They walk up to the counter, where they are greeted by a young guy who is the receptionist.]

Receptionist: Good evening.

Aerith: Heya.

Receptionist: Welcome to the heart and soul of Wall Market—the Honeybee Inn. Is there a honeyboy or girl whose company you desire?

[Cloud hesitates for a few seconds.]

Cloud: We're here to see Andrea Rhodea.

Receptionist: Ahh, the shining star of the Honeybee Inn. Now, are you the one who made the appointment, sir? Can I have your name?

Cloud: Oh, we don't have an appointment.

Receptionist: I see… I'm terribly sorry, sir. An appointment is required, and the earliest available slot is three years from now.

Aerith: Three years!?

Cloud: All we want is five minutes. He can spare that.

Aerith: I need his help for the Corneo audition.

Receptionist: Yes, well, regardless of the circumstances, you cannot meet him without an appointment.

Aerith: Is there really no other way?

Receptionist: It is rare, but Mr. Rhodea does occasionally extend invitations to individuals who catch his eye. Otherwise, I'm sorry, but there really is nothing that can be done.

Aerith: I guess that's that, then. Ah well. Let's try someone else.

Receptionist: I'm sorry that I couldn't be of more help to you.

[They go outside and hear a familiar voice from afar.]

Johnny: The hell is this bullshit? I ain't payin' that much!

Madam M: Well, this ain't a charity—so if you don't have the gil to pay, then get the hell out!

[Johnny flies out of the place and runs away. Cloud and Aerith enter and find themselves in an establishment decorated in traditional Japanese style. Madam M, a lady wearing a kimono and carrying a fan, greets them.]

Madam M: Welcome, welcome. Just the two of you? Step right up. Now then, what manner of massage do you desire?

Aerith: Say what?

Madam M: This your first time in our establishment? We are a hand-massage parlor. An excess of fatigue and tension can make even the simplest task a terrible strain. It is our pleasure to relieve our patrons of that tension. And what better way to seek relief than through the skilled ministrations of a professional? So now that we understand each other, what manner of massage do you desire?

Cloud: We're not customers.

Madam M: Then you are…?

Aerith: Hoping you can help us get an invite to an audition with Don C—

Madam M: (angrily) Oh for the love of—Say another word and I'll shove this fan right down your throat! This is the last thing I need. You're young and stupid, and I suppose that means you think I'll let you off easy. So you want what? A favor? Well, here's the thing… This is a massage parlor—a respectable establishment. But if you don't require our services… (screams) Then tell me! Is there any reason I shouldn't have you dragged outside and shot for wasting my valuable time!? Well!?

[She approaches Cloud, clearly interested in his appearance.]

Madam M: Hm. Name?

Cloud: …Cloud Strife.

Madam M: Hand.

Cloud: Huh?

Madam M: Give it to me! The strong, firm hands of a fighter… yet they possess a certain elegance and grace. Okay, Cloud. Let's see what you're made of. After that… we'll talk. So. Which course will it be?

Luxury Course - 3,000 G ✓
Standard Course - 1,000 G 
Poor Man's Course - 100 G
Not today.

Madam M: Then make your way to the room in the back… and wait.

Aerith: Cloud…

[Madam M goes behind the screen with Cloud.]

Madam M: This exclusive treatment is reserved for our most well to-do patrons… First… the hand creams. A generous coating for each and every one of your richly deserving fingers… Let’s start… with the tips… That's it. Relax. I'm only here to help. Oh? Did that hurt?

Cloud: No…

Madam M: Then I'll move on… to the base of the fingers… Let's see if we can't improve your circulation. Get that blood flowing. No, don't fight it. Stress is poison to the body. And finally… some gentle stimulation for the palm. No more than a touch. Just like this. Oh? What was that? A cry of pleasure? Is this how you like it? How about this? Or maybe this?

[Cloud moans with pleasure. After a while, the massage ends. Madam M comes out from behind the screen.]

Madam M: If that was to your liking, do come again.

Cloud: Right.

Aerith: How was it?

Cloud: Huh?

Aerith: You okay?

Cloud: Yeah…

Aerith: You're acting weird, Cloud.

Cloud: I am?

Aerith: Really weird.

Madam M: Think you'll make a habit of it? All right then. I think I've seen everything I need to see.

Aerith: So…

Madam M: Tell me what you want and we'll take it from there.

Aerith: You're one of the Trio, right? I want to get into Corneo's next audition.

Madam M: And why in the world would you want to do that? Hmmm… Okay.

Aerith: Really!?

Madam M: But. You cannot go dressed like that.

Aerith: Huh?

Madam M: I could never send Corneo a candidate wearing such a plain-looking getup. Doing so would call my position as one of the Trio into question.

Aerith: Is something wrong with my outfit?

It's alright.
Looks comfortable. ✓ 
It matter what I think?

Cloud: It's comfortable, isn't it?

Aerith: Cloud, the fashion critic.

Madam M: Look, just… take it outside the parlor, would you?

Aerith: Sorry, we'll stop. So… what should I do about the outfit?

Madam M: You just leave that to me. I put you in a dress so fabulous, you'll look like a million gil. So long as you can afford it.

Cloud: How much?

Madam M: What I said. But don't worry. It's obvious you can't afford a dress with that kind of price tag. So listen. I have an idea. There's an underground colosseum in this town. Up for a fight, Cloud? Good, because I'm getting you into that arena. If you win the tournament, I'll transform Aerith into a drop-dead gorgeous beauty.

Cloud: There any prize money?

Madam M: Yes—for the person who got you in. So? What do you say?

Cloud: All right.

Madam M: That's what I like to hear. You'll need this. They're already letting fighters inside. You should hurry, run along. Remember: you are going to win me that money.

[Cloud and Aerith come out of the massage parlor.]

Aerith: What have we gotten ourselves into?

Cloud: Nothing good. I wouldn't expect a fair fight in this town…

Aerith: Think we can win it all?

Cloud: That's one thing I'm definitely sure of.

Aerith: I appreciate the confidence, just… don't get too cocky, okay?

[They come into the coliseum.]

Staff: You lost? This is for spectators only.

Staff: What's this? You're here to compete? I hope you know you're cutting it really close. So—the two of you are a team?

Cloud: Team? No, it's just me—

Aerith: Yes! The two of us are a team! I need to get into that audition, but I won't let anyone else fight my battles for me. That includes you, mister.

Staff: All right, team it is. Head to the waiting area down below.

[Cloud and Aerith take the elevator down to the arena.]

Aerith: Down, down, down we go. So how deep does this thing go, you think? I wonder how many people are fighting. Hey, you're not nervous, are you?

Cloud: Nope.

Aerith: Really? You're even more quiet than usual.

Cloud: Just trying to focus. Like you should.

[They get off the elevator and walk down the long hallway to the arena.]

Staff: Hey, lovebirds! Over here!

[Meanwhile, the show has already begun!]

Scotch: In the city that never sleeps! 

Kotch: In the paradise of debauchery and sin—of pain and pleasure! 

Scotch: Where your every desire can be indulged for the right price—Wall Market!

Kotch: To you esteemed connoisseurs of chaos and bloodshed—we bid you the warmest of welcomes!

Scotch: Are you sitting comfortably? For tonight, the most gruesome spectacle anywhere in Wall Market or beyond shall be yours to witness! Here in the Corneo Colosseum!

[Behind their backs, firecrackers explode and sparks fly upwards in a bright fountain.]

Kotch: Tonight's grand prize is no less than one million gil! And there is only one way to get it: brutalize your opponent!

Scotch: Thoroughly and utterly!

Kotch: Viciously!

Scotch: Without mercy!

Kotch: Until they vomit blood!

Scotch: Only the most ruthless fighters—

Kotch: The savages still standing here at the end—

Scotch: Shall claim the gil and the glory!

Kotch: And now, the long-awaited event in which the blood starved beasts will battle for your amusement is upon us!

Scotch: Warriors of every shape and size will fight to the death before your very eyes! In tonight's Corneooo Cuuup!

[We return to the corridor where Cloud and Aerith are standing.]

Aerith: Wow, this place is really something.

Staff: You two-wait here until it's time.

[Cloud and Aerith go into the waiting room. As they rest, they hear crying coming from the next room…]

Johnny: Oh… You again.

Aerith: Ouch! What happened to your face?

Johnny: I just needed a little scratch, you know? So I signed up for the preliminaries, and well… I hope you guys realize what you're getting into. I don't wanna scare you but if you can make a run for it, you should.

Announcer: (via loudspeaker) Cloud and Aerith. Your match will begin shortly. Please make your way to the gate.

Aerith: We're in way too deep to back out now.

Johnny: Never been more scared in my entire life. It's a gift from Don Corneo. Drink it, and they say you'll be raring to go for hours on end. If I had, maybe things would've gone differently for me. Maybe you should. It's yours if you want. 

I'll taste it. ✓ 
I don't need that.

[Cloud drinks the potion.]

Aerith: How is it?

Cloud: It's thick…

Aerith: But you… like it so much you couldn't possibly share, right?

Gatekeeper: You two ready?

Ready. ✓
Not yet.

Gatekeeper: Try not to get yourselves killed.

[Cloud and Aerith enter the arena!]

Scotch: For our next match, we welcome two fighters—a young couple, no less!

Kotch: Talk about a bad date!

Scotch: This is their first tournament!

Kotch: A bad first date!

Scotch: And most likely their last, inexperienced as they are or are they!! Give it up for Cloud and Aerith!

Kotch: Booo! Get lost! Go home! You suck!

Spectator: "Couple"!? Get outta here with that lovey-dovey bullshit!

Spectator: ‘Sup with the pole!? Gonna do a little dance for us, baby girl?

Aerith: Okay. Now I'm mad.

Kotch: Their opponent—one of Wall Market's own, a renowned master of beasts! Will his pets make a meal of our iwo challengers. before our very eyes?

Scotch: They've already been given their appetizer!

Kotch: Their hunger for flesh and fear is unquenchable—the demon dogs of hell, the Sanguine Stalkers!

[The gate opens and a man runs out. He falls to the sand and is attacked by two red-skinned hyena-like beasts.]

Staff: No, please!

Beastmaster: Feast!

Aerith: You brought animals?

Beastmaster: Oh? First-timers, huh? There's no rule that says you gotta fight man-to-man.

Scotch: We're in forma treat, ladies and gentlemen! Who will prevail in this brutal contest between man and beast!? This could be over in an instant, so don't even blink! Without further ado, the fourth match of the first round… begins now!

[Cloud and Aerith defeat the Beastmaster and his beasts.]

Scotch: Can you believe it!? I don't think anyone saw this coming!

Kotch: What a completely unexpected turn of events!

Scotch: And the winners of our match are… Cloud and Aerith!

Announcer: (via loudspeaker) Contenders, please return to your waiting room.

[Cloud and Aerith go to the waiting room to take a break.]

Aerith: Well that's one win down. Go team! What's wrong?

Cloud: The rules don't make sense.

Aerith: Yeah, true. But maybe it'll be better in the next match?

Cloud: Nah, wouldn't bet on it. Better to expect the worst.

[In the waiting room they find the defeated Beastmaster. He sits dejectedly on a chair.]

Beastmaster: Well that was some bullshit.

Announcer: (via loudspeaker) Cloud and Aerith. Your match will begin shortly. Please make your way to the gate.

Staff:  You've got some time before your next match. Get some rest.

Gatekeeper: That's what they call beginner's luck. But the next match won't be so easy. Ready to rock?

Ready. ✓
Not yet.

Gatekeeper: Just remember: try not to die.

Scotch: For the second match in our spectacular semifinals… Fresh from their first date with death, I present… the lucky couple!

Kotch: More like “unlucky” for the rest of us!

Scotch: Give it up once again for Cloud and Aerith!

Spectator: "Couple" my ass! The hell you two tryin' to pull!? You assholes cost me a fortune!

Kotch: Their opponents—reavers of the scrapyard, thieves and killers through and through! Too criminal for common criminals—the worst of the worst!

Scotch: Ladies and gentlemen, check your pockets, because they may have already robbed you blind!

Kotch: The most contemptible sons of bitches this side of Wall Market—Beck's Badasses!

[Three of the idiots we already know come out of the gate.]

Aerith: Hey, it's those guys.

Burke: Hey… It's those guys!

Beck: Well, hot damn! Been fixin' to feed you two your just desserts! So open wide, 'cause we're gonna serve up a heapin' helpin'!

Butch: Hey, what do "just desserts" taste like?

Beck: Like justice! Like payback!

Aerith: Huh? More of 'em?

Scotch: And who are these unscrupulous-looking gentlemen!?

Kotch: It would seem that there are actually eight members of Beck's Badasses!

[A few more thugs come out of the gate.]

Aerith: Hey! That's cheating!

Beck: The only rule here is that there are no rules! If Corneo says it's okay, then you gotta suck it up!

Kotch: The don has granted his approval!

Aerith: This is ridiculous!

Kotch: The odds are overwhelmingly stacked against them!

Scotch: This could be a real bloodbath! So I implore you, ladies and gentlemen—don't look away, or you may miss the best part!

Kotch: The second match of the Corneo Cup's semifinals… begins now!

[Cloud and Aerith beat Beck's team.]

Kotch: Un-freaking-believable! What the hell did I just see!?

Scotch: It was two against, uh, I don't remember how many exactly, but a lot! But somehow, the winners of our match are… Once again! Cloud and Aerith!

[Cloud and Aerith go to rest. Meanwhile on the podium. In a designated area for important guests…]

Sam: That kid's really something.

Madam M: Well, of course he is. I did give him a massage, you know. His palm told quite the tale. He's cheated death more than a few times…

Sam: So have half the people in this town. Anyway, we're both still alive. Call it?

[He pulls out another gold coin.]

Madam M: There you go again. One of these days your "luck" is going to run out.

Sam: When I fall from grace, maybe I'll land in your parlor once more.

Madam M: That is one mistake I will never repeat.

Honeygirl: You gotta admit, Andi—the way he moves is totally amazing!

Honeygirls: Andi!

[We return to the waiting room.]

Aerith: Next up: the big finale.

Cloud: Yeah.

Aerith: I thought you'd be happier.

Cloud: Just thinking about what we might face next.

Aerith: But you know, we've made it this far. I'm sure we can handle anything they throw at us.

Announcer: (via loudspeaker) Cloud and Aerith. The final match will begin shortly. Please make your way to the gate.

[Cloud visits Beck's defeated gang in the next room.]

Butch: Does… this mean I don't gots to play dead no more?

Beck: Damn, you two are really somethin' else. I could use, that kinda muscle in my gang.

Burke: So… hungry.

Gatekeeper: Man, you proved me wrong! You guys are pretty good! It's the final match! You good to go?

Ready. ✓
Not yet.

Gatekeeper: I've got a lotta money riding on you two. Win it for me!

Kotch: Ladies and gentlemen, our time together is almost over!

Scotch: Tonight's thrilling Corneo Cup-filled with unprecedented upsets and drama—has only one match to go!

Kotch: We know—we're just as disappointed as you are! But ladies and gentlemen, all good things must come to an end! So let's celebrate by getting so damn loud—they'll hear us up on the plaaate!

Scotch: Once more, the sweethearts who've surprised us with upset after spectacular upset! The power couple with a boundless love for bloodshed! The champions of Madam M—Cloud and Aerith!

Kotch: Yeah! Come on now! Come on, you can do better than that! And now—five-time winners of the Corneo Cup! Murder machines with countless kills to their names!

Scotch: Along with a handful of meanings.

Kotch: The deadly duo that takes out the trash with a vengeance!

Scotch: The electric executioners… Chocobo Sam's champions… Cutty and Sweepy!

Kotch: Come on out!

[Two robots with metal circular saws on their hands come out of the gate.]

Aerith: Robots!?

Cloud: More like Shinra armor.

Aerith: More like cheating!

Scotch: Who will walk away with the one-million-gil prize!?

Kotch: Get ready for a fight guaranteed to go down in history!

Kotch & Scotch: The final match of the Corneo Cup… begins now!

[Cloud and Aerith defeat the robots.]

Kotch: This has never—! I can't believe it! And the winners of the Corneo Cup—the deadly and dynamic duo, Cloud and Aerith!

[The guests of honor sitting on the podium are vividly discussing the fight.]

Madam M: My condolences.

Sam: Hmph.

Madam M: Oh! You're taking this rather well. I was looking forward to a little temper tantrum.

Sam: When you bet it all on a toss, sometimes you get burned by lady luck. Every coin has two sides.

Madam M: You're right of course—even if they are both the same.

Sam: Later.

[He leaves.]

Madam M: And now, I believe I have a prize to collect.

Leslie: Sorry—the madam will have to wait. The don's demanding that we tack on one more match, it seems.

Madam M: What?

Leslie: If they win out, then you get paid in full.

Madam M: (angerly) Now hold on just a goddamn minute!

Leslie: His call, not mine.

[Meanwhile, in the waiting room.]

Aerith: Now that that's over, we can go save Tifa.

Cloud: So we'll head back to Madam M's, get you changed, and then it's off to Corneo's.

Aerith: Right!

Madam M: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But… you still have one fight left.

Aerith: What do you mean?

Madam M: The crowd loved your show a little too much. People were placing hefty bets, much heftier than you can possibly imagine. Corneo's going to milk this for as much as he can.

Cloud: Meaning what?

Madam M: You face and defeat Corneo's fighter of choice, and only then will you be declared winners of the tournament.

Aerith: Hey! That wasn't the deal!

Madam M: (angrily screams) Don't you think I know that!? You greedy bastard! Scum-sucking piece of shit festering asshole!

[Cloud and Aerith are discouraged by her angry tirade.]

Madam M: But that's the way it is. Corneo's the one who makes the rules around here. But if you win this match, Corneo will have to accept your victory. And the crowd will make sure he does.

Cloud: So this is the last one?

Madam M: I sure hope so. Go on, now. That prize money is going to pay for your dress.

[Cloud goes into the next break room and meets Sam there.]

Sam: Well then. You sure fixed my wagon. Do you two have any idea how much those mechs cost me? Sure you got time to shoot the shit with me?  Don't think you do.

Gatekeeper: Watching you guys fight gave me goose bumps. Hope your next match is even better than the last! Ready to kick ass!?

Ready. ✓
Not yet.

Gatekeeper: It's not even about the money anymore, man. I just want you guys to win it all! Show 'em what you got!

Scotch: Tonight's Corneo Cup has been a spectacle like no other. And we shared your disappointment, ladies and gentlemen, when we told you that it was coming to an end.

Kotch: But nobody felt it more keenly than one Don Corneo…who has decided that a bonus match is in order!

Scotch: Participating in this match will be this evening's leading lights--the dynamic duo that has crushed all competition thus far! Cloud and Aerith!

Spectator: Cloud! Cloud! Over here!

Spectator: Look at them! They're so adorable!

Spectator: You're the man, Cloud!

Spectator: Aerith! I love you! Marry me!

Kotch: Their opponent! Buried in the bowels of the Colosseum… An unspeakable horror, long imprisoned, set free tonight for your entertainment!

Scotch: The secret star of Don Corneo's stellar stable!

Kotch & Scotch: Enter: the Hell House!

[This time the gates open in the center of the arena. From there, an entire house rises in a cloud of smoke!]

Aerith: It's just… a house.

[The house begins to blaze with fire and act as if it were alive.]

Cloud: That's no ordinary house!

Kotch: The manifestation of pure evil versus the most badass couple this side of Midgar—have you ever seen a fight more incredible, more epic!?

Scotch: You have noi! No sir, you have not!

Kotch: They'll be singing songs about tonight for generations to come!

Scotch: Keep your eyes glued to the action, ladies and gentlemen!

Kotch: The Cup's final, final battle…

Kotch & Scotch: Begins… now!

[Cloud and Aerith fight the, uh, house and after a while it falls, uh, on its foundation as if tired of fighting. Aerith goes to it but Cloud stops her.]

Cloud: Wait!

Madam M: It's almost disappointing.

Andrea: No. Not yet…

[The house transforms into a robot that looks like a chick in an eggshell. Using the wheels, the robot house chick begins to hunt for Cloud.]

Scotch: Ladies and gentlemen!

Kotch: What is happening!?

Aerith: What the—

Cloud: Look out!

[After a long and grueling fight, Cloud sticks his sword into the robot's head and defeats him. The crowd swoons with delight, and then begins to shout for joy. Fireworks light up on the sides of the arena.]

Aerith: We did it!

[She gave him a high five.]

Kotch: And the winners—

Scotch: And champions—

Kotch & Scotch: Cloud and Aerith!

[Madam M jumps for joy from her chair.]

Andrea: That boy…

Madam M: Awfully rare, you showing an interest in someone. What will you do?

[Meanwhile, Cloud and Aerith go out into the corridor.]

Staff: Why didn't you tell me you guys were gonna kick so much ass!? Can I get your autographs?

[Cloud shakes his head and walks away.]

Gatekeeper: There you are. I've been looking for you two. So Madam M wanted me to give you a message. She says you guys did pretty damn good, and that you should swing by her shop when you're done here. Got it? I was also hoping you might be interested in a few more matches here at the colosseum. Big events like the Corneo Cup are pretty sporadic, but there's always action if you wanna get a piece.

Staff: Aerith, you were amazing! There's never been a female champion before.

Staff: Watching you win was so inspiring! It made me want to fight too!

[The heroes go out into the city and go to Madam M's massage parlor.]

Madam M: You're here. Good. I have everything I need to get started. Just one thing before we do. You're the Cloud, right? Cloud the merc? I'm told you did a wonderful job helping the people of Sector 5. You have a very impressive work ethic. (laugh) It's like they say, "Good things come to those who work." What goes around, comes around and in ways that might surprise you. (laugh) I'm gonna put Aerith in the most gorgeous dress you've ever seen. It'll be a real jaw-dropper. All right. Now that that's out of the way… Once you change, you won't be able to leave town. Are you sure you're ready?

[Cloud nods.]

Madam M: All right, then. Let's get started. Beauty takes a lot of work and preparation far more than you'd know. In the meantime, let me see, let me think… There oughta be things you can only do without your friend. Now's your chance to get out and have some fun. (laugh) I can tell you're already beginning to feel at home here. Though being so new to it I assumed you still wouldn't know how to enjoy yourself properly. So I went and had a chat with Sam. He said he'd be happy to help you out.

Cloud: Hey. No one asked you to do that.

Madam M: But there's so much you don't know! This is the perfect opportunity for you to learn the ways of the world and man the hell up! And that's enough of that. Aerith, come with me.

Aerith: Oh boy! I can't wait to see the dress!

Madam M: The dress is part of it, sure… but we'll also need to do something about that plain-Jane makeup and hairdo. This is gonna take some work.

Aerith: Ouch! Well, I'll see you later, Cloud!

Madam M: Peek and I'll poke out your eyes.

[She goes behind the screen with Aerith. After waiting a few minutes, Cloud can't help but go peeking…]

Madam M: I thought I told you, no peeking! You have a lot of nerve. How old are you?

[Without waiting for Madam M to run out of patience, Cloud goes out on the town to take a walk while Aerith dresses up.]

Undercity Resident 1: Hold it. Best to steer clear of this alley. You may not like the people you find down here—and they may not like you.

Undercity Resident 2: We're cool, though. Just blowing off work, is all.

Undercity Resident 3: Hey, you think that guy's doing okay? He wasn't looking so hot, you know. Maybe we should go check on him.

Undercity Resident 4: But this street. Isn't it…

Undercity Resident 5: The one that everyone says is bad news? Shit, you're right. I don't wanna go down there now.

Undercity Resident 6: Aren't you a curious cat. Walking dark alleys. You've got balls, so I'll give you a pass… this once. You didn't see or hear anything. You get me?

Person with Indigestion: My stomach… Aaah… Urrrg…

Barker: So, what kind of mischief you looking to get up to tonight?

[Cloud goes to check on Sam at his farm.]

Sam: Howdy. Madam M said you'd be swinging by. Lemme see if I've got this straight. You ditched your lady friend and fellow champion to have a boy's night out in Wall Market? 

[Cloud gets a little tense.]

Sam: Kidding! If I know the madam—and I do—this was all her idea. I can see why. There's no denying you're skilled with a sword, but when it comes to damn near anything else, well… can't help but have my doubts. Ain't nothing wrong with that, but then there's nothing wrong with expanding your horizons neither. Seeking new experiences. Knowing the ways of this here world will help you to better protect her while you're in it. Reckon I've got a few solid gigs for you. Whaddya say? You game?

Cloud: …Yeah, why not.

Sam: That's the spirit. You have yourself a grand time tonight, mister merc.

[Cloud returns to town and walks into a gym where he meets a transvestite jock and two muscular guys beside him.]

???: Cloud! Been waitin' for you to show up. Thanks for coming, and welcome to our humble training hall. Jules—head trainer. If you've got some time to spare, how about a little bit of fun? Wanna try taking on one of our guys?

Ronnie: You're not serious, are you? Look at him! He's a scrawny little thing. I could snap him like a twig!

Jules: Now, now—I wouldn't judge this one by his muscle mass. What do you say, Cloud? If you wanna give it a go, just let me know. So? You up for a round?

Yes ✓
No

Ronnie: Ha! You're taking me on? You look like a dried-up old, terpsicolt left out in the sun. You got no idea what you're getting into, little man.

Jules: All right, enough talk. We'll settle this the tried-and-true traditional way: a squat-off. Now, let's all see what you've got.

[They are competing in squats. Cloud wins.]

Cloud: Was never in doubt.

Ronnie: How—? How the hell did I lose to this scrawny little kid who looks like he doesn't even consume his daily recommended amount of protein?

Jules: Ronnie you know it's all about quality, not mass! You're too quick to judge people by their build. That, and your overtrained ego are the main reasons you lost to our bold challenger here! Thanks for helping me teach my boys a valuable lesson. And sorry for dragging you into it. Cloud, we're all one big family here at this gym, and now you're part of it. If you're ever up for training, our doors are always open to you. Let's work together to maintain healthy minds and bodies. If you're ever in the mood for another workout, just talk to Jay or Ronnie.

Jay: You wanna go, do ya? All right then, bring it on!

Yes ✓
No

[Cloud beats Jay in the squats.]

Cloud: That it?

Jay: You did it, you really beat me. You gotta be in incredible shape!

Jules: It's unfair that you guys are having all the fun. What do you say? May I have this squat? You up for some exercise?

Yes ✓
No

[Cloud wins again.]

Cloud: Nothing to it.

Jules: I had no idea how strong you really were. You truly are something, aren't you? Listen up, everyone. We can be stronger, better. Let's hit those weights!

Gym Members: You got it, Jules!

[Cloud goes to the clothing store.]

Clothing Store Owner's Son: Welcome! Anything in particular you're looking for? Oh, you must be the merc I've been hearing about! I need you to help me out with… my dad. His drunk ass has been at the bar for hours now. Could you bring him back here? He's probably three sheets in over at Drunkards'. Just over there.

Johnny: Wait up, Cloud! Sam caught me up on everything. He said you're gonna go rescue Tifa. And to do that, you're trying to learn all about Wall Market. Bro, I know this town like the back of my hand, so I can answer all of your questions! Now, let's go knock this one out! The bar's this way, Cloud. This is the Drunkard's Den—the best place in Wall Market to drink away your problems!

[They enter the bar.]

Singer: Thank you. I signed with Shinra Records a while back, but I'm still looking for my first big hit. It's been seven years now. Not easy, but you gotta do what you love─and I love to sing. This is a new song of mine. Maybe it'll be that number one.

[Johnny notices the father of the clothing store owner and approaches him.]

Johnny: Hey! Old dude!

Clothing Store Owner: Huh…? Son is that you? Did you always look so… moronic?

Johnny: Wha─? Well, right back at ya! Ugh, whatever. We're here to take you back to the store.

Clothing Store Owner: I'm not going back! Not ever! My life is ruined. It's over. Kill me now!

Johnny: Come on, there's no need to talk like that, old dude! I’ll help you out or whatever you need!

Clothing Store Owner: Really? Oh, thank you, son! See, I made this bet with the materia merchant—a sure thing but then I lost… And so I had no choice but to steal my heart and surrender my precious inspiration!

Johnny: Your precious inspir—who with the what now?

Clothing Store Owner: INSPIRATION! Without it, there's simply no point in me ever going back to the store…

Johnny: Got it mean, I don't got it, but… I just need to get your inspiration back, right? Whatever the hell that is. Leave it to me, old dude!

Clothing Store Owner: Uh, hey… aren't you gonna go with your friend? (to himself) My dear beloved girls, I'm so sorry…

[Cloud comes out of the bar.]

Chadley: I hope you will continue to help me gather vital information for my research. I look forward to receiving all of your future battle intel submissions.

[Cloud goes in search of the salesman with whom the store owner has made a bet.]

Johnny: This place looks kinda creepy, don't you think? Like maybe they practice ritual sacrifice or…

[They walk into a store in the dirtiest alley of the city. The salesman, a bearded man with dark glasses, is lying on the floor and resting.]

Johnny: Sooo… this is it, huh?

Materia Vendor: And whadda you two want?

Johnny: I'm here for the precious inspiration" you took from the old dude.

Materia Vendor: Inspiration…? Oh, that thing. But I didn't take it, I won it fair and square. It's mine by right now.

Johnny: Well, that's true!

Materia Vendor: But I tell you what I'll consider giving it back in exchange for… a favor.

Johnny: …Whatcha need?

Materia Vendor: Something only… “real men” can deliver.

[Johnny gets a little tense.]

Materia Vendor: I need you to go and get me something from the vending machine at the inn. You know what. You know!

Johnny: No, I don't think I… Wait. The Sauce!

Cloud: The Sauce?

Materia Vendor: Stop saying "the Sauce!" …Anyway. Good luck.

[Cloud leaves the store.]

Johnny: I wish I was here with Tifa. No offenses, bro.

[He goes to the hotel, where he finds a vending machine.]

Johnny: That's it. That's the one! It looks like a regular old vending machine, right? But wait! You ready for this? All right. This particular model has secret buttons.

Cloud: Where?

Johnny: Well… I can't tell you it's a secret! You just need to tap into your knowledge and expertise-like, grab it and whip it out! And then you'll be able to see everything!

[Cloud takes a ball of materia out of his pocket.]

Cloud: I don't need to “whip it out.” I've done this before. Watch this.

Johnny: Whoa, look at you, bro!

[Cloud throws materia into the vending machine and gets a random item.]

Johnny: Huh? Is this the Sauce? I dunno… Come on, brol You know there are more hidden buttons waiting to be pushed!

[Cloud tries again.]

Johnny: Oh… So this is the Sauce. Neato… It-it's time. The last button…

[Cloud is trying his luck for the third time.]

Johnny: The Sauce! P-put it away! Put it away before someone sees you! No one can know that we have it!

Vending Machine: You're the grand prize winner! Have a special prize!

Johnny: Don't scare me like that! Whatever! We got what we came here for. Let's get outta here and head to the materia guy!

[They go back to the store.]

Materia Vendor: Ohh! It's you two!

Johnny: It's time, bro! The Sauce.

Materia Vendor: Could it be…? It is! The Sauce! The Sauce! Whoa… Never thought I’d live to see the day…

Cloud: It's just sauce. No big deal.

Materia Vendor: Don't sell yourself short! This is only given to one who is truly a man among men.

Cloud: (smirks) I know.

Johnny: Damn, bro! That's why you're such an awesome dude!

Materia Vendor: Oh, right… Hate to break it to you, but that thing you were looking for? Not here. It's long, long gone.

Johnny: You shittin' me!?

Materia Vendor: Nope. Sorry. As I recall… the guy who runs the restaurant should have it.

Johnny: Well, I guess we know where we're headed next. Come on, bro!

Materia Vendor: Well, that's that. Time to polish the ol' orbs, give them a spit shine so they positively sparkle! Hey. If you're done here. then get goin' already!

[Cloud and Johnny go to the restaurant.]

Restaurant Owner: Welcome! Feel free to take any open seats.

Johnny: Sorry, we're not here to eat. The material guy gave you something, yeah? We want it.

Restaurant Owner: Materia guy? Ohhh, you're here for that. I'm surprised—didn't like you for the type. Lemme ask you something. Either of you know anything about cooking?

Johnny: Nope. Never cooked once.

Restaurant Owner: That's too bad. For some reason, my food doesn't taste nearly as good as it used to. I was hoping one of you two might be able to help me figure it out. I've narrowed it down to the fridge, the stows, or the power supply, but I'm not sure what's to blame.

Johnny: Man. I seriously have no idea what it could be. This sucks.

[Cloud decides to answer something at random.]

Stove ✓
Fridge 
Power Supply

Johnny: I've got it! The problem is the heat's not high enough.

Restaurant Owner: Oh? Know a little something about fire, do ya? Okay then. Let me try turning it on to see if you're right.

[He tries to prepare a dish by taking advice.]

Restaurant Owner: Well, would you look at that! Works fine. Here! Eat up.

Johnny: Man, this looks great!

[They taste the food they have prepared - a big bowl of rice, some kind of soup, roast meat, and pickled vegetables. After the meal, Johnny runs out of the restaurant to throw up.]

Johnny: I can't…

Restaurant Owner: What a shame. He seemed to be enjoying the meal so I wanted to ask him what he thought. Maybe next time. Anyway, thanks for your help. Oh—and here's a voucher with my apologies. Get the poor guy some medicine, will ya?

[Cloud takes Johnny to the pharmacy.]

Johnny: Sanctuary…

Pharmacist: Hey, you. This yours?

Cloud: Well…

Pharmacist: Oh, that a voucher you got there? Should've said something sooner. Come on in. What is it with today? People are dropping like flies.

Cloud: Besides this dumbass?

Pharmacist: Loads of 'em. I got enough outstanding orders to fill a book. I was about to leave and make some deliveries, but…

Johnny: I'm gonna hurl…

Pharmacist: Can't very well leave him alone, now can I? Hey, you’re not doing much. Maybe you can deliver that medicine for me. You're, what, military or something, right? Then you must know a thing or two about dealing with the sick and injured.

[Cloud agrees to help.]

Pharmacist: You're a lifesaver—literally. So, lemme see, what needs delivering… Here—need you to deliver this to someone. You probably find this guy sprawled out on the ground somewhere. But make sure you check his symptoms before giving him meds.

Johnny: My body…

Pharmacist: If I had to guess where a sick person'd end up, I'd say the toilet. Start by checking those. Maybe ones in the shops nearby?

[Cloud begins to explore the city in search of sick people.]

Man in Line: C'mon, asshole! Hurry the hell up!

Patient: It was poisoned, I tell ya. The sick sonuvabitch puts poison in his food…

Cloud: I've got meds. Lemme take a look at you.

Patient: Thanks, buddy! You saved my life. Here, it's not much, but it's yours.

Patient: I'm grateful for your help but… do you think a guy could get a little privacy?

Cloud: Should probably head back.

[He goes back to the pharmacy. Johnny turns out to be healthy and tells the pharmacist his retarded stories.]

Johnny: And then there was this crazy-looking house, right? And it was all like trying to kill 'em! But then Cloud was all like bing bang, boom!

Pharmacist: Your friend fought… a house? A house?

Johnny: Oh, hey! Welcome back, bro.

Cloud: Better already?

Pharmacist: Yeah and now he won't shut up. Anyway, how'd the deliveries go?

Cloud: I did about as much as I could.

Pharmacist: Thanks for the help. And great work. Anyway, I promised it'd be worth your while. Here, I've got something you’re definitely gonna like.

Johnny: What is it?

Pharmacist: Well, it belonged to the owner of the clothing store first. Heard from the cook that you boys been running all over the town looking for this, am I right?

Johnny: Wait, we have? Hold up. What were we going before all this? Oh shit! The inspiration!

Pharmacist: Bingo. Y'see, all us Wall Market entrepreneurs go way back. We get together for a game every night. It all kinds of stuff. This found its way into the pool, and eventually into my possession. And now it's yours 'cause hey—why the hell not. It's a VIP card, highly coveted and extremely rare. They’re only given to a select few. Not that having it's gonna do you much good, but…

Johnny: Holy mother of… No way! Bro! We gotta get to the Honey—er, um, I mean Drunkards' on the double!

Pharmacist: Tell the old man I said hi!

[Cloud and Johnny return to the bar.]

Johnny: You still got the inspiration, right? You didn't lose it!? Hey, old dude. We're back.

Clothing Store Owner: Huh? Who're you? You're no son of mine. I think.

Johnny: Special delivery just for you.

Clothing Store Owner: (joyfully) My inspiration! You've returned to me at long last!

Johnny: Yo, is that… what I think it is…?

Clothing Store Owner: Oh you bet it is. And it was hard won! I sewed dresses day and night for those ladies, until I got what I was after. A Honeybee Inn VIP card.

Johnny: I know it!

Clothing Store Owner: Now make way for the VIP, boys. I don't wanna keep my ladies waiting any longer! But first—I should pick up a dress!

Johnny: Lead the way, old dude! We are comin'!

[Cloud goes to the clothing store to talk to the son of a perky old man.]

Clothing Store Owner's Son: Well, thanks for bringing him back. Can't imagine what you went through. Here, you earned it.

Johnny: Hey—you're coming, right, bro? Get ready for a real Wall Market education!

Cloud: I'm done with this. You—you can do whatever the hell you want.

Johnny: I get it, bro. You're scared. It's only natural for people to fear the unknown.

[Cloud sighs.]

Johnny: It's a pity you're not gonna join us, but I swear to you, bro, as an aspiring Wall Market connoisseur… I'm gonna go in there and get as much inspiration as I can handle. For you bro! For you! Because Cloud—you are my one true bro. Honeybee Inn, here I come!

Clothing Store Owner: Inspiration, here I come!

Clothing Store Owner's Son: Perfect example of how age has absolutely nothing to do with maturity.

Cloud: Couldn't agree more. (to himself) Should probably go see Sam again.

[He goes to the chocobo farm.]

Sam: So, tell me. What'd you see in our little enclave of sin and debauchery? Bet it was an eye-opening experience.

Cloud: Nothing I haven't seen before. That it for jobs?

Sam: Not exactly. I got one more favor to ask. You wanna get Tifa out, right?

Cloud: What's your angle?

Sam: Heh, just get your ass to the colosseum. You’ll see.

Gatekeeper: We've been waiting for you champ! Take on which challenge?

Special Match ✓
Free Battle
Cancel

Gatekeeper: Stands are packed, thanks to you! Now get out there and give 'em a show!

[Cloud enters the arena!]

Gatekeeper: Lovers of bloodshed and mayhem! Your favorite champion, Cloud, is back in the ring! Right now, this boy may be hot, hot, hot… 

[Cloud is confronted by two fiery Bombs!]

Gatekeeper: But look out, folks, 'cause these dynamite challengers may just blow the champ clean off his throne! I hope you brought shades because you're about to see some fireworks! Fighters… begin!

[Cloud wins the fight.]

Gatekeeper: The reigning champ does it again! Was that hot enough for you, fight fans? Did the champ bring the heat!? Indeed he did─he proved there's nothing more explosive than the guns he's packing!

[Cloud goes to Sam.]

Sam: Nice going, champ. You were in fine form today. Here's your cut. You earned it.

Cloud: Not here for the cash. Tell me about Tifa.

Sam: Ahh, Tifa… She's something of a bombshell herself, huh? Girl keeps in shape, and boy does it show.

Cloud: Hey.

Sam: Just making an observation, that's all. Anyway, seems like you're serious about getting the poor girl out of her predicament. I could tell easy enough by the way you fought back there.

Cloud: Cut to the chase. Well? You helping or not?

Sam: Never said I would─opposite, even. Getting mixed up in other people's business isn't my way. Plus… As you are now, I reckon you could ride to her rescue without anybody's help. And that's the truth. You've changed since you first rolled into this here town. For the better. At any rate, I've said all I'm gonna say. Your lady friend oughta be done changing by now, am I right? She ain't no Tifa, but she is a firecracker. Keep her waiting too long and she might just blow up in your face.

[Cloud returns to the massage parlor.]

Check in on Aerith?
Yes ✓
No

[As soon as Cloud touches the doorknob, Johnny runs up to him.]

Johnny: Nooo! Cloud! Finally! Tifa! She─I─ Tifa! Sh-she's─ I don't─

Cloud: Take a deep breath. What about Tifa?

Johnny: I heard Corneo was gonna audition new girls soon, and Tifa's… Tifa's gonna be─I just… I-I don't know what to do.

Cloud: Well I do.

Johnny: I'll come too! Hey Cloud! Bro! I can call you bro, right?

Cloud: Nope.

Johnny: Just wanna say, bro, that I'm totally relieved that you're looking out for Tifa. So like, how'd you get so strong anyway, bro?

Cloud: I said─

Johnny: The way you fight, bro, is like poetry in violence. "Bam! Bam! Whoosh woosh!" You know? I really wish I could be just like you. My problem is that I tend to overthink and overanalyze everything. So─bro, do you have any advice for a smart, stand-up guy like myself?

[They come to the Japanese-style mansion behind the bridge, which they have been to before with Aerith.]

Johnny: Well, this is it for me. Call me crazy, but I have a feeling that I'll just be getting in the way.

[Cloud sighs and puts his palm to his face.]

Cloud: Go find Aerith at Madam M’s. Tell her to wait for me there once she's done. Think you can handle that?

Johnny: Yessir!

[He runs away. Cloud enters the mansion.]

Leslie: You again.

Cloud: Got a letter of approval right here.

Leslie: You know that's only good for women, right?

Cloud: Yeah. It's for Aerith.

Leslie: Who? Oh, that girl you were with. Sorry to hear that. Well, either way, you're stuck out here, pal. I can't let you in.

[Cloud grabs the hilt of his sword.]

Cloud: I wasn't asking for permission.

Leslie: Wouldn't try it if I were you. Trust me, you don't wanna screw with the don. If you even think about causing any trouble, he'll make sure someone pays for it. And that 'someone' might wind up being the girl you're trying so hard to break out. Or it could wind up being someone you've never even met before. Get it? You're in the don's world now. Anyway, you've got some time yet. The audition won't start for a while. If you're sure you wanna go through with this, then bring the girl and the letter. But… if I were you, I wouldn't. Go on, get outta here.

[Cloud comes out of the mansion and notices a large crowd of people. They are fussing over someone. As he gets closer, Cloud sees that it is Johnny. They take his picture and don't let him pass.]

Johnny: Hey, get outta the way! Quit gawking! Move it move it! C'mon! 

[However, people are not gathered because of this moron. A dazzlingly beautiful girl in a red dress approaches the bridge. Cloud notices her, and at that moment his eyes light up the fireworks in the sky.]

Johnny: Yo, clear the road!

[This is Aerith. Johnny rolls out the red carpet in front of her.]

Johnny: Ma'am.

[Aerith approaches Cloud.]

Aerith: Heya.

Cloud: That's really…

Aerith: Yeah. Corneo's got certain tastes. This dress is so gaudy and impossible to move in…

Cloud: Y-yeah…

[His brain is already somewhere in the sky.]

Aerith: Cloud!?

Cloud: ‘Scuse me. Hey, wait a minute. Did Johnny forget to give you my message?

Aerith: The one asking me to stay put? No, got it. I was worried about you.

Cloud: I'm starting to think this place is more dangerous than we thought. Who knows what they'll ask you to do in this "audition." No way in hell I'll let you go in there by yourself.

Aerith: By myself? Oh, don't worry, I wasn't gonna. Come on. You'll see.

Cloud: See what, exactly?

Aerith: According to Madam M, you've caught the eye of a certain fabulous someone, and they'd like to meet in person.

Cloud: Huh?

[He follows Aerith. Passersby keep their eyes on Aerith. She is dazzlingly beautiful.]

Loitering Man: Look at you all dolled up and fabulous. Where are you headed tonight?

Sweet Old Man: Well, what do we have here? You're quite the pretty little lady.

Woman in Lowe: What? Say that again.

Man in Love: Don't be like that. You're still the most beautiful girl in the world. And I'm lucky to be with you.

Womanizer: Hey there, cutie. Where you headed? Why don't you let me buy you a cup of coffee?

Aerith: C'mon Cloud, this way! Cloud! It's going to start soon. No time to dillydally─let's go!

Sharp-Tongued Woman: That dress is completely overshadowing her. She's got a lot to learn.

Poet: You are like the beautiful flower that blooms under the brilliant moonlight.

[They approach the Honeybee Inn.]

Cloud: Why are we here?

Aerith: To see the Honeybee Inn's Andrea Rhodea, and convince him to give you his stamp of approval. You said you didn't want me going alone, right? Well, with Andrea's help, you can join me. It'll be fun! And honestly, I think you'll look pretty cute in a dress.

Cloud: What!?

Aerith: It's pretty rare for Andrea to take a personal interest in someone. At least, that's what Madam M said. Trust me, this is gonna work out great.

Cloud: Uhh…

Aerith: C'mon. Don't you wanna save Tifa?

Cloud: Wait─

Aerith: No can do, Cloud. This is our plan, and you'll learn to love it. So! Here's how I think we should approach him. Madam M said Andrea was a man who'd give anyone a fair chance to win him over. So I say we march right up to him, explain the situation, and see where that gets us. Sound good?

[Cloud walks into the Honeybee Inn with a heavy heart. He has a hunch that something bad is about to happen…]

Receptionist: Good evening. Welcome to the entertainment extravaganza that is the Honeybee Inn.

Cloud: We're here to see Andrea Rhodea.

Receptionist: You must be Mr. Cloud. He's waiting for you.

Cloud: "Mr. Cloud"?

Receptionist: I've been instructed to send you through without delay, sir. Please, make your way to the stage in the back.

Cloud: What stage?

Receptionist: The one in the back, sir. Straight through those doors and down the hall.

[Cloud walks through the chic interiors of the hotel looking for the right scene.]

Honeygirl 1: And here's the man of the hour!

Honeygirl 2: Chosen by Andrea himself.

Honeygirl 3: Our honored guest!

[Cloud decides to enter the scene.]

Honeygirl 1: This is your first time, right? It's okay. Do you want to practice your dance moves first?

Cloud: Why would I want to do that?

Honeygirl 2: Andrea thought it might be a good idea.

Honeygirl 3: Over here, c'mon now!

Cloud: Hey! Hold on!

[The girls drag him to the stage and Cloud has to dance a little…]

Honeygirl 1: Fabulous!

Honeygirl 3: Just like that!

Honeygirl 2: Wow!

Honeygirl 1: Deeelicious.

Honeygirl 3: Perfection!

Honeygirl 1: Work it, honey!

Honeygirl 2: You've got real rhythm, mister. Move over girls, a new dancer's come to town!

[Having finished training, the girls drag Cloud on the real stage.]

Honeygirl 1: C'mon, c'mon─the show's about to start!

Madam M: My, my! Is that Cloud? Darling! I had no idea. (laugh)

Honeygirl 1: Now you just sit tight until Andrea takes the stage!

Honeygirl 3: Look at his muscles!

Honeygirl 2: Aww, he's blushing!

[The show begins! To a specially written song, the girl bees dance with the guys in cylinders. Andrea, the innkeeper, who looks very much like a homo, emerges from the flower.]

Andrea: Welcome to the Honeybee Inn… Cloud. 

[He starts touching Cloud, to which he turns to him with a legitimate WTF on his face. Andrea puts his finger to his mouth.]

Andrea: You seek my approval, do you? I understand. But those who crave my favor must first prove that they know how to move. 

[He and his bees start dancing. A stunned Cloud tries to leave, but the girls won't let him. Aerith cheerfully supports Cloud's torment, for whom this whole gay-club thing is not a source of much joy. After the dance, the girls part, giving way on the dance floor to their boss. He asks Cloud to dance. Exhaling, Cloud agrees. He has no desire to lose to this fag!]

Andrea: Think you can follow my lead?

[They're doing some kind of extremely gay dance.]

Aerith: (cheerfully) You're a star!

[Another gay dance.]

Aerith: (cheerfully) Nice moves! I love it!

Andrea: Honey… I'm in love.

[A heart goes out of his hands.]

Andrea: Yes. Yes, I will transform you into a vision of beauty. Now, without further ado, let us begin! 

[The girls bring the throne and sit Claude on it. Judging by the look on his face, he did not expect this turn of events. A homo in a hat comes up, dyes him and changes his clothes.]

Honeyboy: You were born for this.

[Aerith seems to have lost her mind. She rejoices so much as if she were drugged. The girls remove their feather fans, revealing us the "new" Cloud. Yes, it's just Cloud with lipstick and in a blue dress. They even braided his hair for some reason - Cloud doesn't have that long hair. Aerith is ecstatic to look at this squalor. Cloud is hard at work figuring out an escape plan, but all routes are blocked. The queers dancing around surround him, and Andrea blocks his exit from the stage. That's why his sword was taken away…]

Andrea: Come.

[He dances with Cloud pretending to dance with a woman of unclear reason.]

Andrea: Perfection! True beauty is an expression of the heart. A thing without shame, to which notions of gender don't apply. Don't ever be afraid, Cloud.

[At last the torment ends. Aerith is waiting for Cloud at the exit of the inn. We are given control of her as a reward for Cloud’s torment.]

Showgoer: That show today blew my mind!

Showgoer: Hey, look at me! I can dance too!

Poet: But one must behold such flowers from afar.

[Aerith walks over to Cloud, staring off into the wall. He's still shocked by what happened and by the fact that he'll have to wear a dress for a while.]

Cloud: Please, don’t. Not a word.

Aerith: Not even one?

Cloud: No!

Aerith: But you're so pretty! Hey! Watch the way you walk.

[They leave. Cloud has to walk carefully so as not to ruin his dress. That's how he walks through town.]

Womanizer: Whoa! Be still, my heart! It's the girl of my dreams!

Chadley: Ohhh… Ahem. Forgive me, miss, but the way you're staring at me is rather… O-oh goodness… I'm experiencing an emotional response… What is this emotional response…?

Woman in Love: There you go again. Stop looking at other girls!

Man in Love: I only do it to compare them with you so I can realize how lucky I am!

Woman in Love: You know, I'm starting to think you're kind of an idiot. Eyes on me, babe. Just me.

[Cloud enters the mansion behind the bridge.]

Leslie: No way.

Aerith: Here you are─letters from Andrea Rhodea and Madam M. That ought to do the trick, right?

Leslie: You serious?

Aerith: Is there a problem?

Leslie: I hope you know what you're in for.

Aerith: Oh, we'll be fine.

Leslie: If you say so. Come on.

[He opens the gate and lets the heroes pass.]

Corneo Lakey: The two of you here for the audition? Second floor, at the very end of the walk. And don't go pokin' your nose in where it doesn't belong!

Corneo Lakey: That one's Madam M's girl, ain't it? Man, she's hot.

Corneo Lakey: We've been waitin' for ya to show.

Corneo Lakey: That Andrea's girl? I'd let her do things to me.

Corneo Lakey: Hey, hands to yourself!

Corneo Lakey: Go to your room and wait. Quietly.

Corneo Lakey: You can't afford a single thing in this place, so don't break shit.

Corneo Lakey: Room's at the end. Keep walking!

[Cloud and Aerith walk into a closet-like room. Something's wrong - it's not right for such beauties to be in a place like this! Suddenly the door slams shut.]

Aerith: What's that weird, sweet smell? And why do I feel so dizzy?

Cloud: Gas. Come on.

[He tries to open the door by force, but it doesn't work.]

Cloud: Dammit.

Aerith: Cloud…

[They fall to the floor. At that moment, lakeys in gas masks enter the room.]

Corneo Lakey: Wassup? How you pretty ladies doin'? Feeling a little light-headed? Well, we can't have that. What say we escort you to the parlor, so you can make yourselves more comfortable?

Corneo Lakey: Let's get this show on the road.

Aerith: Where… are you… taking us?

Corneo Lakey: C'mon now. Upsy-daisy…

Corneo Lakey: Hey! Handle with care, asshole!

Corneo Lakey: The hell!? You wanna throw down!?

Corneo Lakey: They're Corneo's girls… so if ya leave a mark on 'em, you ain't gettin' off with a warning.

Corneo Lakey: Yeah, I know.

Corneo Lakey: Managed to wrangle some real lookers this time though, know what I'm sayin'?

[Cloud falls asleep and when he wakes up and opens his eyes, he sees Tifa in front of him.]

Tifa: Hey, can you hear me?

Cloud: Tifa!?

Tifa: Yes…?

Cloud: You okay?

Tifa: …Mm-hmm.

Cloud: Good.

Tifa: Wait a minute. Cloud!? Is that you!? Oh my god, that makeup! And that dress!

Cloud: Nailed it, I know. Thank you. Moving on.

[He notices Aerith getting up from the floor. They find themselves in what looks like an abandoned building. There is a pile of dust, boxes, and junk everywhere.]

Cloud: You good?

Aerith: Yeah. Bit woozy, but I'll manage. Hey, Tifa. How you doing?

Tifa: Okay…

Aerith: Oh right─I'm Aerith. A friend of Cloud's. We were worried and thought we'd come help you out.

Tifa: Thanks…?

Cloud: Cut the chatter. We gotta leave.

Tifa: Huh?

Cloud: Right now.

Tifa: No! Not until I've got what I came for.

Cloud: What?

Tifa: So… After we made it back to the slums, some guys came around asking all kinds of questions. So I did some digging…

Cloud: And found out they were Corneo's men.

Tifa: Right. They were interested in Avalanche… But… I couldn't figure out why. So I thought I'd come and ask the man himself.

Cloud: Seriously?

Tifa: Thought if I could find a way in and get some one-on-one time… But then I realized I'd only be one of three candidates. And that if he didn't pick me… it would all be for nothing.

Aerith: Then your worries are over, aren't they? Because the other two candidates are right here. Right?

Cloud: Right…

Aerith: So yeah! If we're all in on it, then nothing can go wrong!

Tifa: Uh, I guess not…

Aerith: You─me─Cloud. Makes no difference who gets chosen, does it?

Tifa: I dunno, Aerith. It feels wrong getting you involved in all this.

Cloud: Don't even bother trying to talk her out of it.

Aerith: Aww! Cloud gets me! Took you long enough.

[She pats him on the shoulder.]

Cloud: So what happens now?

Tifa: I think they'll call for us when it's time.

Aerith: This room gives me the creeps.

Corneo Lakey: Now ladies, listen up. I'm sure you're still feeling a bit woozy, but tonight's audition's about to begin. Head out the door to the left and up the stairs. Come on, ladies, let's hustle.

[The door opens.]

Cloud: All right guys. Let's do this.

Tifa: Do you want to do this?

[They go up to the second floor and come out into a beautiful room, in design reminiscent of Madame M's massage parlor (that is, done in the traditional Japanese style).]

Kotch: Okay, my beautiful ladies! Time to line up for the don!

[He looks at Cloud.]

Kotch: Wait. You look kinda familiar. We haven't met before, have we? Eh, whatever. Alright! Y'all good to go? Then let's do this thing! Introducing Wall Market's most eligible bachelor… The one and only Don Corneo!

[A fat man who resembles the fat Pagan Min from Far Cry 4 looks with his greasy face from around the corner.]

Don Corneo: Ladies! Nice. Very nice! 

[The fat man has disgusting manners, a nasty grin, and a nasty laugh.]

Don Corneo: Whichever one shall I pick? 

[He walks up to Aerith and sniffs her from bottom to top.]

Don Corneo: Shall I pick you?

[He considers Tifa's considerable breasts.]

Don Corneo: Or maybe… you?

[Then he walks up to Cloud, whose face says “stay away from me.” Don Corneo grabs Cloud with his fat hands and shakes him happily.]

Don Corneo: Oh yeah! I've got it! I've got it! Today's bride-to-be is…

Aerith: "Today's"?

Kotch: And tomorrow's or the day after's─if the don takes a shine to you.

Cloud: Pathetic.

Don Corneo: Hey, which one of you said that?

[He walks up to Cloud.]

Don Corneo: Was it you? Ohhh, you got a mouth on you! I'm gonna enjoy breaking it in! Today's lucky lady is the big-boned girl!

[He pulls Cloud with him, but he doesn't move. You can tell by the look on Cloud's face that he's about to bury the fat man.]

Don Corneo: Still playing hard to get? I can dig it. Oh yeah. The leftovers are all yours.

[The fat man's lackeys are triumphant.]

Kotch: Hell yeah! Okay ladies, y'all coming with me.

[The fatty himself, meanwhile, takes Cloud into the bedroom.]

Don Corneo: Don't be shy, little kitten. Shimmy on over and give daddy some sugar! No need to play coy. Nobody here but you and me… You're even cuter than I thought!

Cloud: Back off.

[The fatty rolls off the bed for joy.]

Don Corneo: This kitten's got claws! I love it!

[He presses a button and takes a photo.]

Cloud: What was that?

Don Corneo: Don't you worry your pretty little head. Just a picture to preserve the moment! And to ensure you don't do anything inappropriate like say "No"…

Cloud: Asshole…

Don Corneo: Oh! Praise me more!

[Meanwhile, Tifa and Aerith are led to a filthy bedroom where the fat man's henchmen pass the time.]

Kotch: Ayo, fellas, we've got guests! And y'all got first crack at "entertaining" them! Courtesy of the ever-generous Don Corneo himself! Never forget─the don provides!

[The lakeys cheerfully chant the name of their boss.]

Corneo Lakeys: Corneo!

Scotch: So, ladies. Ready to… get to it?

Aerith: Yeah… I guess I'm good to go whenever. How 'bout you, Tifa?

Tifa: Mmm… Four guys between us… Okay. Let's not keep Cloud waiting.

Aerith: Right.

Scotch: Wait… I know you… The colosseum!

[She punches him in the nuts and Tifa kicks him in the face!]

Corneo Lakey: What the hell!?

Tifa: Get down!

[They begin to expertly kick ass.]

Corneo Lakey: Oh, you stupid─

[Aerith swings a chair at him.]

Corneo Lakey: W-wait!

[After a while, all the lackeys are defeated!]

Tifa: Good job, Aerith!

Aerith: It was nothing compared to you!

[She gives Tifa a high five! Suddenly Leslie enters the room…]

Leslie: Andrea filled me in on the situation. I come bearing gifts─your gear. I'll do what I can to clean this up. Just finish the job.

[He leaves for the next room.]

Aerith: Thank you!

[Aerith and Tifa change into their usual clothes and arm themselves.]

Aerith: Okay, let's go rescue Cloud.

Tifa: Corneo's room, right?

Leslie: Better hurry.

[Tifa and Aerith walk out into the main hallway of the second floor.]

Corneo Lakey: Man, I'd love to spend some quality time with girls like that. 

Corneo Lakey: Bet they're going at it right now.

Corneo Lakey: Lucky bastard!

Corneo Lakey: What're you doing here? Hey! Ain't you two the rejects!?

[The girls defeat Don Corneo's bedroom guards. Meanwhile, in the bedroom…]

Don Corneo: Don't stop! Tell me what a bad boy I am!

Cloud: You depraved bastard.

Don Corneo: Yes! Yes, I am! Here I come, baby!

[He tries to jump on Cloud, but the latter repulses the fatty with a nimble kick.]

Don Corneo: Hey! Who the hell gave you permission to do that!? One of you get in here and teach this bitch some manners!

[Aerith and Tifa run into the room.]

Aerith: Sorry, but… Your boys had to learn some manners too.

Don Corneo: What the─!?

Aerith: Cloud! Your clothes!

[Cloud changes his clothes, and the fat man watches the process with admiration. At some point he realizes that something is wrong…]

Don Corneo: So you're a man, huh? What are you three up to?

Tifa: We'll ask the questions. Like: why'd you have men in Sector 7 asking about Avalanche?

Don Corneo: Huh? Dunno what you're talking about.

Tifa: Don't play dumb with me. Let's try again. Why did you have men in Sector 7 asking about Avalanche? Spill the beans or… 

Cloud: I'll cut 'em off.

Don Corneo: Alright, alright! I'll talk! I'll talk! Some guy with a gun for an arm─I was paid to find him!

Tifa: Paid by who?

Don Corneo: I can't tell you that! They'd hunt me down like a dog!

Tifa: Well you better… 'cause if you don't…

Aerith: I'll rip 'em off!

Don Corneo: It was the director of Public Security! Heidegger! It was Heidegger!

Tifa: Shinra!? And what were they planning?

Don Corneo: Some things are better left unsaid, ya know!?

Aerith: See, I'm not so sure they are. Better keep talking…

Tifa: Or I'll smash 'em.

[She stomps her foot on the bed as proof of her intentions. Sexual desire and fear are fighting in the fat man, expressed in nervous laughter.]

Don Corneo: Heh. Alright, you got me. I could never say no to a sexy girl. Since Avalanche blew up two reactors, Shinra's decided they ought to stamp them out, home base and all. And I mean "stamp out." By targeting the support pillar and blowing it up.

Tifa: The pillar?

Don Corneo: Did I stutter? The plate will come crashing down! 

[He is acting out an explosion by waving his hands and making sounds.]

Don Corneo: It'll be Sector 6 all over again. I'm sure you've been there and seen the wreckage for yourself. So you know exactly what Sector 7's gonna look like!

Tifa: They wouldn't…

Aerith: Come on, guys! We gotta go!

Don Corneo: Before you do!

Cloud: No.

Don Corneo: Please! This won't take long! As everyone knows, villains only divulge their plans in a certain situation. But what is that situation?

When they’re faced with certain death.
When they think they've already won.
When they've lost their minds.

[Cloud doesn't have time to answer, discouraged by the question.]

Don Corneo: Oh, I'm sorry! Time's up! The answer lies… in the sewers!

[He pulls a lever and a secret hatch opens under the heroes' feet…]

Don Corneo: Hee hee hahaha! Enjoy the sights and smells!

[He falls on his bed and rolls around laughing. On the blanket we see the character 天, which means heaven. The screen fades and we are transported to the headquarters of the sinister Shinra Corporation.]

President Shinra: Are we on schedule?

Heidegger: (laughs) The Turks are on top of it. Yes, there will be no delays.

Reeve: Please, Mr. President! I am asking you to reconsider─no, begging. The Sector 7 undercity is home to more than 50,000─

President Shinra: (sighs) Director Tuesti.

Reeve: At least let us issue a warning, sir.

Heidegger: The stench of the director's cowardice fills the room yet again.

President Shinra: Reeve. Progress requires sacrifice. Learn to live with it.

[Reeve clenches his teeth in anger and frustration.]

Chapter 10: Rough Waters
[We return to our heroes who found themselves in the sewers. The fall was not too soft, for they fell on the stone floor. Cloud wakes up first. Muddy water drips down on his face. He gets to his feet and notices that Tifa and Aerith are unconscious.]

Cloud: Where in the…?

[He looks around and realizes that they are in a sewer.]

Cloud: Damn, it reeks.

[He approaches Tifa.]

Cloud: Tifa?

Aerith: Cloud… We have to get back to the slums─right now!

Cloud: Yeah.

Tifa: I didn't wanna drag Aerith into all this…

Cloud: She'll understand.

Tifa: How do you two know each other?

Cloud: I saved her, she saved me… Round and round it goes.

Tifa: And… that's all there is to it? Sure there isn't something else going on?

[Meanwhile, Aerith comes to her senses.]

Aerith: Dammit.

[They hear a terrifying roar coming from somewhere in the depths of the sewers. A huge monster, a mix of a minotaur and a pig with a snake's tongue, rattles toward them. It roars eerily. Cloud draws his sword.]

Cloud: Good to go?

Aerith: You bet!

Tifa: Bring it on!

[Together they defeat the monster, which is called Abzu by the way. It falls to the floor, but then stands up with the last of its strength and with a powerful tug it breaks through a brick wall and leaves.]

Tifa: There it goes…

Aerith: Do you think it lives down here, or…?

Cloud: Was probably Corneo's pet. And we were dinner.

[Aerith shudders at the thought of it.]

Tifa: Hey… You don't believe that crazy story of his, do you? Shinra wouldn't sacrifice a whole sector just to take out Avalanche, would they? Destroying part of the city─killing all those people, just to get at us?

Cloud: I dunno… Is Corneo the kind of guy who'd make up shit just to screw with you?

Tifa: I wouldn't put it past him.

Aerith: But… if he was telling the truth… And there's still a chance he was, isn't there? Then… we should go. And if it turns out he was lying, then so what? Right?

[After thinking for a while, Tifa runs away.]

Cloud: Tifa!

[Soon the heroes hear her voice from afar.]

Tifa: I knew it. These tunnels are all connected.

[Cloud approaches her.]

Cloud: What is it?

Tifa: I'm pretty sure we can use these tunnels to make our way back to Sector 7. The sewers under Sectors 6 and 7 should be connected. "If you get in trouble, just follow the stench."

Cloud: Another one of those lessons?

Tifa: An Avalanche saying, actually. We use them to move around the undercity. In emergencies.

Cloud: Sure we're not lost?

Tifa: Positive. There should be a big waterway just up ahead. Let's find that first.

Aerith: Lead the way.

[They begin to investigate the gutters. After a while, they manage to find a switch that drains part of the gutter.]

Aerith: Ugh, it reeks down here.

Tifa: Well the undercity isn't exactly the prettiest place, and we're under that so…

[They descend into the drained gutter and move on, intermittently interrupting to fight monsters.]

Tifa: Is it safe to go through here?

Aerith: It's really dark.

Tifa: I'm sure we'll be fine. Come on. Hey, Cloud… Assuming Corneo was telling us the truth… What do you think Shinra's really up to? I mean, they've gotta have an endgame, but I can't imagine what it is. Destroying a whole chunk of the city just to get back at us doesn't make any kind of sense.

Cloud: Yeah. I can't imagine any way they could profit from it. It's gonna cost them a fortune to rebuild.

Tifa: Corneo's lying. He's gotta be. Guys like him do it all the time out of habit.

[They enter the pump control room.]

Cloud: That's a power generator, all right.

Aerith: Wow. Talk about ancient.

Cloud: It's an antique─older than the mako reactors even. It'll be a miracle if it still works.

[He pulls the switch on the panel. Nothing obvious happens and the characters leave the room.]

Tifa: Hey, would you look at that!

Aerith: And let there be light!

[They continue to explore the sewers.]

Tifa: Wait a minute. I know this place. Sector 7 should be just on the other side of this waterway.

Cloud: So this is where Sector 6 ends.

Tifa: And where Sector 7 begins. Once we cross over we can start looking for a way back to the surface.

Cloud: Might be harder than you think.

Tifa: Let's just try to make our way down this tunnel. See if we can't use those gates to clear a path. We can do this. We'll figure it out.

Aerith: Yeah, for sure.

[They keep trying to get out of the sewers. By controlling the flow of water, Cloud lifts several pontoons to form a makeshift bridge.]

Cloud: I'll go first, okay?

[He steps onto the pontoon and carefully walks to the other side.]

Tifa: Dammit. I can't stop thinking about what Corneo said.

Aerith: I know… Me too.

Tifa: It's gotta be a trick. There's no way they'd go that far. But… But what if Corneo really was telling the truth…? We have to get there in time to stop it. We have to.

Aerith: Right.

Tifa: Aerith, what are you not telling me?

Aerith: Huh?

[Cloud, meanwhile, is already on the other side.]

Cloud: Guys! C'mon! We gotta keep moving!

Tifa: Coming! I'll go first.

[She gets to the other side.]

Tiaf: Okay Aerith! Your turn!

Aerith: On my way! Here we… go. 

Tifa: Almost there!

[The pontoon begins to shake and Aerith is frightened.]

Cloud: Aerith! Jump!

[Aerith jumps abruptly and Tifa grabs her.]

Tifa: That was close.

[The pontoons are sinking in the muddy water.]

Aerith: Thanks. You saved me.

Tifa: Least I could do.

Aerith: Hear that, Cloud? C'mon.

[She walks up the stairs. Tifa follows her. After looking around, Cloud follows the girls. It's always nice to be the last one up.]

Tifa: Focus!

Aerith: Still thinking about the plate?

Tifa: Yeah.

Aerith: The future isn't… set in stone. That's what I always tell myself.

Tifa: Yeah…? I hope you're right.

Aerith: How 'bout this, then? Think of something fun. After saving Sector 7, you're gonna…?

Tifa: I'm gonna… Go shopping─topside! I'll buy… Stuff for the bar! Decorations, coasters…

Aerith: Can I come?

Tifa: You'd better!

Aerith: Then it's a date!

[The girls laugh.]

Tifa: Cloud can carry all our stuff!

Aerith: He'll be our pack chocobo!

Cloud: What was that about me?

Tifa: Nothing!

[Suddenly the asphalt under their feet begins to crumble!]

Tifa: Huh!? No way!

Aerith: C'mon, Tifa!

[Cloud runs to the girls, either to save them or just not to be left behind.]

Aerith: Cloud!

[She holds out her wand to him and Cloud manages to grab it at the last second.]

Aerith: Hold on tight!

Tifa: On three, okay? One, two, three!

[The girls pull Cloud out, falling to the floor from the effort.]

Cloud: Sorry 'bout that.

Aerith: No need to be.

[They continue wandering through the sewer tunnels and fighting monsters. After a while they discover a new control room with lots of ancient machinery.]

Tifa: Guys, check it out. Seventh Heaven's water tank has something similar. I'm betting we can use this to control the sewage level.

Aerith: Hey Cloud─you wanna give it a try?

Cloud: This oughta drain the water… right?

[He tries a lever at random.]

Aerith: No luck?

Cloud: Must be busted.

Tifa: A red light indicates a blockage, apparently. We can use the hand pump to clear the blockage. Sounds about right. I remember having to do this at the bar before.

Cloud: All right. I'll─

Tifa: Aerith, you mind giving me hand? Cloud, you stay put. Keep an eye out for more red lights.

Cloud: Wait, I'm not sure─

Tifa: Trust me. This is the best way to handle it. We'll be back soon.

[The control switches to Aerith. She approaches Cloud.]

Cloud: Just shout if you need anything.

[Aerith follows Tifa, who disassembles the pump control mechanism.]

Tifa: So maybe this is a little different from the one at the bar. More… industrial?

[The girls start pumping and equalize the pressure.]

Tifa: Try to stay in sync. Spectacular! Coulda gone better… That went well. Alright, I think that did it!

Aerith: Wonderful!

Tifa: Okay, let's head back. Cloud's probably getting worried.

[They return to the control room, which by the way is five steps away. Aerith pulls the lever and the pump begins to work. The water is pumped out of the gutter.]

Cloud: Nicely done.

Tifa: We make a great team.

Aerith: Go team!

[Control returns to Cloud. They make their way through the crowd of monsters.]

Cloud: Hang back. I'll go on ahead and secure the exit.

[As Cloud approaches the ladder, several lizards with tridents leap out of the water.]

Tifa: Cloud!

[Cloud pulls out his huge sword.]

Tifa: Looks like they're hungry for more.

Aerith: We're not delicious! Not even a little bit!

Cloud: Get going.

Tifa: Now!

Aerith: Okay!

[She runs away. Cloud and Tifa, meanwhile, fight off the monsters, covering each other epically and standing back to back.]

Cloud: You too!

Tifa: But there's too many of them!

Cloud: Not for me.

[Tifa has Aerith's back.]

Tifa: Hurry.

Cloud: (to the monsters) Last warning! Back off, or die!

[He throws a few blows with his sword and retreats, climbing a ladder.]

Tifa: Cloud!

Aerith: C'mon!

Chapter 11: Haunted
[The heroes make it to the surface. They end up in a train graveyard. A helicopter flies above them in the sky and surveys the area with a spotlight. You can see the Shinra logo on the door of the helicopter. Inside the helicopter we see the already familiar bald man with sunglasses, Rude, and the young guy with red hair, Reno.]

Rude: …Understood. The Avalanche mission's been approved. We are to proceed as planned.

Reno: This is bullshit. What the hell are they thinking?

Rude: "Threats to public order are to be summarily put down." This is what we've always done.

[Reno turns to the window and smirks.]

Reno: "Summarily put down." Guess it's a little late to grow a conscience. …Meh.

[The helicopter takes off.]

Cloud: Just on patrol.

Aerith: Don't worry. We'll make it in time.

[The heroes look around the place they find themselves in. The entire region is littered with rusted railroad cars and various debris. Navigating such a dump is not easy - you have to climb on and through the cars.]

Cloud: We could get lost in here.

Tifa: This is the train graveyard all right─a real treasure trove of scrap. Sector 7 should be just past that large maintenance facility over there. I vote we stay in the light so we can see where we're going.

Aerith: Dark, dark, everywhere…

Cloud: That it?

Aerith: It's deserted… and kinda creepy.

Tifa: People don't come around here often. And not just because of the monsters, but… because of the stories.

Aerith: What kind?

Tifa: Everyone seems to think that the train graveyard… is haunted. "Those who lose their way out there in the dark of night will never, ever find their way back home again."

Cloud: Is that right?

Tifa: I mean, it's not like I think it's true or anything, but you know… it's just…

Aerith: Then let's hurry.

[The heroes continue to explore the grim train graveyard, lit only by burning barrels and dim lamps. On their way they encounter several monsters that they easily defeat. Soon they manage to find some. The door to it opens ajar and then sharply slams shut.]

Tifa: Guys, what was that!?

[Cloud cautiously approaches the door with his weapon at the ready. Several monsters jump out of the door, breaking it down.]

Aerith: Don't scare me like that!

Tifa: I think I just heard a little kid… Did you guys hear it too?

Cloud: Why would there be kids out here this late?

Tifa: What? Then─

[The heroes continue on their way until they find several drawings on the ground made with glowing paint. Cloud hears otherworldly giggles and grabs the hilt of his sword. Once again, however, it's just monsters. Having defeated them, the heroes move on. They fall inside one of the cars through the roof. Aerith shakes off the dust from her lush skirt.]

Cloud: You okay?

Aerith: All good…I think.

Tifa: Still in one piece here too. Guys?

[On the gate appears a drawing just like the characters saw on the ground and the inscription "come on".]

Cloud: Seriously?

Aerith: "Come on," huh? Well, that's… inviting.

Cloud: Alright, let's see what's inside.

[The heroes go to the door and hear the otherworldly laughter of children again. Cloud opens the heavy gate.]

Tifa: Well, whaddya think…?

Aerith: I'm game!

Tifa: But…

Aerith: It'll be fine! We've got a bodyguard, don't forget. Mine! Right?

[She runs up to Cloud and grabs his hand.]

Cloud: Ghosts aren't my thing.

[Tifa also runs up to Cloud and grabs his other hand.]

Tifa: You're just being modest! After you!

Cloud: Mind letting me go, then?

[Breaking free from the embrace, Cloud walks forward. They enter an abandoned station. From afar something like bats are coming from the service.]

Tifa: What was that!?

Aerith: Look! Over there!

[She notices someone around the corner.]

Aerith: Found you. Hey… can we talk? Just for a bit?

[From around the corner comes… the phantom of a child. The phantom turns into a funny flying cartoon ghost covered in a sheet. Soon the phantom is joined by his buddy, who attacks the characters.]

Cloud: Get back.

[After defeating the phantoms, Cloud goes to the first phantom he encounters, grabbing his sword.]

Aerith: Don't!

Cloud: That thing's dangerous.

Aerith: I know, but even so…

[There are many ghostly voices coming from everywhere.]

Tifa: What the─!?

[The child's phantom flies away. The station shakes slightly and the cars attached to the top begin to fall.]

Cloud: Run!

[They manage to escape, but the passageway is now blocked.]

Cloud: You okay?

Tifa: Yeah.

Aerith: Thanks, Cloud. You saved us.

Cloud: Gonna need to find another way through.

[They run to the exit from the station, but the gate closes right in front of them.]

Tifa: Wh-what now?

[They hear a mystical announcement in a nearby carriage. The problem is that it is a broken-down car that has not been connected to electricity in any way for a long time.]

???: This train will be stopping at the Sector 7 slums… and is bound for the train graveyard. The train will depart shortly. Please stand clear of the closing doors.

[Heroes enter the carriage to find out where the voice comes from. At that moment, the doors close.]

Aerith: That's not funny, you know.

Cloud: Guess the crane's up there.

[They go out to the other side of the car and continue to explore the station, trying various levers.]

Cloud: It's not working. There's no power coming through.

Aerith: I wonder if this is another prank? Someone might be messing with the power supply to make us run around.

[They notice a cloud of black smoke billowing in the distance, which takes off into a room with large windows on the other side of the station. They enter one of the empty rooms.]

Tifa: Do you think there's… more in here?

Aerith: Looks like. Aha! Found you!

[They find a way to get to the control room where the cloud of black smoke flew. Cloud looks around and tries to use the ancient equipment there. Cloud activates the crane, but soon the lights go out. The screens on the monitors go out.]

Aerith: Tifa!

[The girls huddle together and back up against the wall. Cloud pulls out his huge sword. Books and various boxes start flying through the air. Cloud helps Tifa escape the pipes flying at her. Aerith is surrounded by phantoms.]

Aerith: "Coming to get you"…?

[The flying phantoms merge into one big vortex of energy and transform into their enlarged form but with several creepy arms on either side. Cloud shatters the box flying at him.]

Cloud: I don't have time for your shit.

[Together with the girls, he defeats Ghoul.]

Aerith: "That was fun"… All this time, you were waiting for someone to come and play with you.

[The Ghoul vanishes into thin air. Cloud walks perplexedly toward Aerith.]

Cloud: What're you talking about?

[Aerith smiles. The lights come back on.]

Cloud: C'mon, let's get back to the crane.

Tifa: "Those who lose their way out there in the dark of night will never, ever find their way back home again." What do you guys think would've happened if they'd caught us?

Aerith: I wonder… Maybe they're the ones who were caught.

Cloud: Can we just drop the whole─

Aerith: What if they're trapped here and can't leave?

[Cloud activates the crane and lowers the car.]

Tifa: Just like we hoped! What a relief.

Aerith: We should be able to get through now.

Cloud: Let's find out.

[They go through a few cars and find their way out of the station.]

Aerith: We're through!

Tifa: Great. Let's head outside. Wait.

[A drawing of a weeping ghost appears on the door of one of the containers. Next to the container appears the phantom of a girl. She sits on the ground with her arms around her knees.]

Aerith: A girl?

Tifa: Marlene?

[She mentally goes back in time. Tifa stands behind the bar and washes glasses. Behind the bar sits Barret's daughter, Marlene, eating something.]

Marlene: …And… the kids that the black wind carries away have to live in the train graveyard forever and ever! So you have to stay far, far away from there!

Tifa: All right, then. I will.

[She enjoys eating porridge from a shallow plate.]

Marlene: Oh, you know Betty? Yesterday she went with her daddy to… to…

[She gets a little sad.]

Marlene: When is… Daddy coming back?

Tifa: Actually… he might not make it home tonight.

[Her words upset the girl greatly. Tifa realizes this with a look in her eyes as well. The flashback ends.]

Tifa: Marlene, what are you─

[However, she vanishes into thin air. Tifa turns to the others with a serious face.]

Tifa: We can't waste any more time here.

Cloud: What was that about?

Tifa: Nothing you need to worry about. Let's get going.

[They go outside and approach the bridge moving in a circle. Cloud finds the control lever and pulls it.]

Aerith: It's moving!

Tifa: Maybe now we can get to the other side.

[The heroes defeat several monsters and continue on their way.]

Tifa: This path is blocked too? But we're so close, I can see it.

Aerith: Hey, do you think these trains might still run?

Cloud: Could give it a try.

[He enters the train control booth.]

Cloud: Good call. Looks like it still works.

[He starts the train. There is a sharp jolt from which the heroes in the cabin almost fall. The train pushes another train blocking the passage. However, after the camera switches to the general view, we see that the train is actually being pushed by a powerful swirling black cloud, which then disappears.]

Tifa: Everybody good?

Cloud: Yeah.

[Suddenly the crackle of an old radio breaks out in the cabin.]

Aerith: Huh? I think that's…

[There are voices coming from the radio, although they are barely audible.]

Tseng: (via radio) Plate separation code is… Got it?

Reno: (via radio) Yeah, yeah, of course I do! We can drop the damn thing whenever… It's just that…

[We are transported to Reno and Rude in the cockpit of the helicopter. The latter is firing a machine gun at several men standing on the metal stairs of an unfinished building.]

Reno: You got a death wish or something? Because I sure as shit don't.

Tseng: (via radio) Reno, what's happening? Do we have a problem?

Reno: Not really. Small arms fire from some local boys trying to defend the pillar.

Tseng: More would-be heroes, huh? Sending reinforcements. The more players that take the stage, the better.

Reno: So that's what we are, huh?

Tseng: Contact me when the mission is complete.

[Meanwhile, our heroes heard the whole conversation!]

Cloud: Tifa…

Tifa: They're really gonna drop the plate.

Cloud: They won't if Barret and the others have anything to say about it.

Aerith: All we can do now is keep moving.

Tifa: Please… Please let us be in time.

[They try to leave the train graveyard with redoubled fervor. Cloud notices several helicopters flying over them.]

Cloud: Why am I not surprised?

[He starts one of the trains and pushes the other car blocking the track.]

Aerith: Wow─would you look at that!

[They come out on a wide area.]

Tifa: Almost there. Come on!

Cloud: Right.

[They are again surrounded by phantoms.]

Aerith: Cloud!

Cloud: Aerith!

[The phantoms are stealing Aerith! She disappears into the black smoke. Cloud looks around, trying to figure out their route.]

Marlene: (offscreen) The kids that the black wind carries away have to live in the train graveyard forever and ever!

[The phantoms carry Aerith to a warehouse house nearby. They circle around her until a phantom with a teardrop drawn on a hole in the sheet flies up to her.]

Aerith: You're just trying to help, aren't you?

[She tries to touch the phantom, but it flies away and vanishes into thin air. Black smoke appears around Aerith and a large masked figure with a glowing hole in the center like an eye emerges from it. He reaches out his hand toward her, which causes Aerith mental pain.]

Aerith: You. You're the one who…

[She strains her thoughts trying to communicate with the phantom through telepathy. By reading the phantom's thoughts she hears the children's voices.]

Boy: Are you ready? Well, are ya!?

Boy: I'm ready now!

Girl: Me too!

Boy: Found you!

Girl: No way!

Boy: We found you!

Boy: Aw, you got me.

Boy: Hey, where's Aerith?

[Aerith realizes that these are events from her past. She sees herself as a little girl sitting with her back to the others.]

Spirit of Aerith: I'm ready! I'm ready!

[No one responds.]

Spirit of Aerith: I said I'm ready! Come get me! (sad) I'm right here…

[She sits down on her knees and begins to cry. The adult Aerith watches this.]

Spirit of Aerith: Mooom…?

[The adult Aerith puts her hands on her face and cries, too.]

Cloud: Aerith!

[He runs up to her and grabs her, dragging her behind him. At that moment a huge chariot monster bursts into the warehouse, Eligor, the monster with the glowing eye. He flies over the roof, while Tifa approaches Aerith and puts his hand on her shoulder.]

Tifa: Hey. We found you.

[She helps her get up.]

Aerith: I guess you did.

[Eligor begins circling around the heroes. Cloud grabs the hilt of his sword and takes it out.]

Cloud: Let's go.

[The fight begins!]

Tifa: How do we hurt it?

Aerith: Hit it with magic!

Cloud: It'll bounce right off. Gotta deal with the barrier first.

[Eligor throws his spear at Cloud, but he dodges. Eligor takes advantage of the moment to attack swiftly.]

Aerith: Cloud!

Tifa: Look out!

[Eligor fires a laser and Tifa tries to cover Aerith, but Cloud lands in front of them and blocks the laser with his giant sword. The fight continues until Eligor is almost defeated. Tifa looks at the handful of Avalanche members fighting Shinra's helicopter on the stairs of the unfinished building we saw earlier from the Reno and Rude helicopter.]

Tifa: Hold on, guys. We're coming.

[She turns to Eligor.]

Tifa: And you… can go to hell!

[She runs up to him and finishes him off with a jump kick.  Cloud and Aerith approach her.]

Tifa: Let's go.

Cloud: Right.

Aerith: Right!

[From the body of the defeated Eligor burst "souls" absorbed by him. The phantom with a drawn tear drop flies up to the heroes.]

Tifa: It's that ghost…

[It dissolves into thin air with the others.]

Tifa: Wow…

Aerith: So long.

[Heroes run to the unfinished building, but run into a fence.]

Aerith: We made it!

[All they have to do is watch another helicopter fly toward the Pillar.]

Chapter 12: Fight for Survival
[Meanwhile, Barrett, Jessie and a few other Avalanche members are fighting Shinra's soldiers in the stairs of the pillar. It's a hell of a fight.]

Shinra Helicopter: (via loudspeaker) Attention, Avalanche! You are surrounded! Stand down and surrender to Public Security immediately! Shinra does not negotiate with terrorists! Resist and we will use lethal force! I repeat: Shinra does not negotiate with terrorists! Resist and we will use lethal force!

[Barrett opens fire on the helicopter from which the message comes.]

Barret: Got your lethal force right here, asshole!

Security Officer: Stop! I said stop!

Security Officer: Drop the weapon now!

Avalanche Member: Screw you, you fascist pricks!

[He opens fire wildly and immediately receives several bullets in the chest, after which he falls off the building onto the pavement, breaking the crossbar.]

Tifa: Dropping a whole plate… just like that. No. No way.

[She runs toward the pillar.]

Aerith: Tifa!

[The heroes follow her and soon come to a small square. Tifa stands and looks around, hesitating to go any further. Aerith also looks around and realizes that they are not alone.]

Aerith: Please let us through!

[Three ghosts appear out of thin air, resembling the grim reapers, or, more accurately, the Dementors from Harry Potter. Without thinking twice, Cloud draws his sword and attacks the closest of them, but despite the fact that the sword stabs into the body of the reaper it doesn't seem to do any damage.]

Cloud: What are you!?

Aerith: Cloud, Tifa! We have to get past, whatever it takes!

Tifa: Right!

[They start fighting reapers.]

Tifa: There's too many!

[After a while, however, the reapers simply fly away. Aerith looks after them, folding his arms in prayer.]

Cloud: Aerith?

Aerith: Come on!

[They run up to the pillar located in the poorest slums. People in rags peek out of hastily stacked houses made of rubble and debris. The heroes hear Barrett's voice coming from above.]

Barret: What you got!? Come on!

Tifa: That's Barret!

[There is an explosion and a fat man in a red bandana comes flying out of the pillar screaming.]

Cloud & Tifa: Wedge!

[Wedge manages to get his gun-hook caught on a beam and cushions his fatal fall, suffering only bruises. The heroes run up to him.]

Cloud: You okay!?

Wedge: Cloud… It's Shinra! They're trying to take out the pillar!

Cloud: I know.

Wedge: I have to go back—Barret and the others are still—

Cloud: Stop! Stay with Wedge. I'm going up.

Aerith: Sure.

Wedge: I'm going too! I can still fight! Biggs, he—They were shooting at me and he—

Tifa: Wedge please. Let Cloud handle it.

Aerith: Don't worry. I'll patch him up.

Wedge: Hang on, guys! Help is coming!

[The reapers that the heroes recently fought are flying toward the building... Cloud notices this and realizes that this is not good.]

Cloud: Wedge—listen to me. You stay here with them.

[Cloud enters the pillar. Meanwhile, the wounded Biggs, standing on the stairs, notices him.]

Biggs: 'Bout-time you showed up, merc.

[He is checking the cartridge in his gun.]

Biggs: Gotta do my part to clear the path before you steal the show.

[Several soldiers run up to him. Cloud begins to climb the stairs of the unfinished building, mopping up floor after floor with the enemies using his enormous sword.]

Security Officer: What the—? Avalanche!?

Security Officer: Hostile contact—one target! Engage!

Security Officer: Bastards just keep coming!

Security Officer: Don't think you're gonna get away with this!

[When Biggs goes up to the floor where he was, Cloud finds him sitting unconscious against the wall. One of the reapers looms over him. Cloud runs to Biggs and comes face to face with a reaper, staring at him from under an empty hood. Cloud grabs his sword and the reapers disperse.]

Cloud: Biggs!

Biggs: You made it… though… I might not. Hey. Is Wedge...

Cloud: Don't worry. He'll bounce back.

Biggs: That's… good to hear… Could've used some extra padding myself.

[He starts coughing a lot.]

Cloud: Don't talk.

Biggs: It’s… pretty bad up there. 

[He takes Cloud's hand and squeezes it tightly.]

Biggs: Cloud. Promise me. Don't let it be for nothing.

I won't. ✓
What about you?

Cloud: I won't.

Biggs: You're a good man. Giving me that… that comfort. 

[His hand falls to the floor.]

Biggs: Oh. One more thing. The Leaf House. It's an orphanage. In the… Sector 5 slums. The kids… they're great. I used to visit—

[He is coughing heavily again.]

Cloud: That, you'll have to do yourself.

Biggs: Lemme guess… not a fan of kids.

Cloud: No.

Biggs: But you have… so much in common. 

[He touches Cloud's hair.]

Biggs: Good luck… Cloud. Our fiture… is in your hands.

[He dies and Cloud is moved by his death. He struggles with his own contradictions.]

Cloud: This isn't over.

[He gets to his feet and starts going up the floors of the unfinished pillar, killing Shinra's soldiers.]

Helitrooper: Contact—L5! Moving to engage!

Helitrooper: Wutai dogs!

[When Cloud comes out on the stairs, Reno’s helicopter flies up to him and blinds him with its powerful flashlight.]

Reno: (via loudspeaker) Testing, testing… Attention, Avalanche scum! We know all about your evil plans to destroy the pillar. But the Turks—ahem! But Shinra—that's us—won't let you get away with it! So go crawl back into whatever hole you crawled out of, or something! That oughta do it, right?

Rude: Eh. Good enough.

[Reno notices Cloud.]

Reno: Wait. I know you… Mister “First Class.” (chuckles)

[He continues to chuckle and activates the machine gun.]

Reno: First-class asshole! Gotcha now! You ain't got nowhere to run!

[Cloud dodges shots and hides behind some construction materials.]

Cloud: Not good.

Rude: (via loudspeaker) Throw down your weapon and surrender! Shinra does not negotiate with terrorists!

Reno: (laughs) Man, screw this cheap-ass play.

[He shoots at the materials - some metal beams - and they fall down, right on Aerith and Wedge! Aerith covers Wedge with himself.]

Tifa: Get down!

[She hits the falling beams with a kick of her foot.]

Aerith: Thank you!

Wedge: That was a close one…

[He gets up.]

Aerith: How is it?

Wedge: Much better, thanks.

[There is an explosion coming from the pillar.]

Tifa: I'm sorry. I can't stay here—I have to help them.

Aerith: Go. Follow your heart.

Tifa: Aerith. There's a bar in the center of town—Seventh Heaven. I need you to—

Aerith: Get Marlene to safety. Right? It's okay. I'll find her.

[At first surprised by such devotion, Tifa takes Aerith's hands and thanks her with a smile.]

Tifa: Can you take her to the bar for me, Wedge?

Wedge: Consider it done! Now get up there and kick Shinra's ass!

[Tifa runs away.]

Wedge: C'mon—Seventh Heaven is this way!

Aerith: Wedge, wait!

[The control switches to Aerith. We follow Wedge.]

Wedge: You guys can't stay here! Come on, come on! 

[He runs up to the gate at which many people have piled up, wanting to leave the dangerous region. Wedge grabs one of the guards, a Shinra soldier, and shakes him.]

Wedge: You have to open the gate! If you don't let these people through—

[The soldier pushes Wedge away and he falls into the mud.]

Senior Officer: Back off! It's not gonna happen!

Aerith: Wedge!

Wedge: I'm no good—not to anyone up there or down here...

Aerith: That's not true, Wedge. Don't give up hope yet! We can still save a lot of lives!

Wedge: You don't think we're gonna stop them from dropping the plate, do you? I wanna believe that we can still win somehow.

Aerith: Mm.

Wedge: But… something in my gut tells me we're due for a reckoning. Just this… feeling. Know what I mean?

Aerith: Yeah... I do. But… that's no excuse to give up. I don't wanna look back one day… and wish I'd done it different. Right here, right now, I need to know I did everything I could.

[Meanwhile, one of the flying Shinra soldiers involved in the battle falls from the sky. He explodes. Wedge gathers courage, shouts loudly, and runs up to the soldier.]

Wedge: I'm not sure what's gonna happen next. But I am sure I don't wanna regret the choices I make tonight. 

[He approaches another soldier.]

Wedge: Our lives are in your hands. If you don't open up, we're all gonna die!

[Suddenly one of the soldiers opens the gate.]

Senior Officer: Close it!

New Recruit: No, sir! I will not obey that order! This way, everyone! Quickly, quickly!

Senior Officer: You can't just... Wait!

Aerith: Wedge! Seventh Heaven is just down this road, isn't it?

Wedge: Head straight and look right—you can't miss it! 

[He sluggishly covers the soldiers with himself, creating the pathetic illusion that he is powerful and formidable.]

Aerith: Don't worry about me!

Wedge: Alright, I'll get these people to safety!

[Dumping the ballast, Aerith runs to the bar while organizing the evacuation of people.]

Aerith: Get out of Sector 7, please! You need to get as far away from Sector 7 as possible! Right now! Go to Sector 5 or 6—anywhere but here! You all have to get out of Sector 7! Now! Please!

Marle: Slow down! Do you know what's going on? What do they want with the pillar?

Aerith: Well, there's still time, but…

Marle: They're going to drop the plate on us?

Aerith: Yes.

Neighborhood Watch Member: Those sons of bitches!

Neighborhood Watch Member: What good do they think that'll do!?

Marle: Feel free to cry about it later! Right now, we need to get everyone to safety.

Neighborhood Watch Member: Wait—the watch should clear the roads first!

Marle: Ah, good thinking! Hop to it!

[She turns to Aerith.]

Marle: Avalanche, I take it?

Aerith: Just a friend.

Marle: Tell Tifa to lay low. We'll take care of things here.

Aerith: I've got to get to Seventh Heaven!

[She finds the bar pretty quickly.]

Aerith: That's it!

[She notices a downed helicopter falling right on top of people!]

Aerith: Oh no…

Under city Resident: Look out—it's gonna crash!

Aerith: Marlene!

[She doesn't budge, not knowing what to do. The helicopter breaks apart and falls very close to her, knocking her to the ground.]

Neighborhood Watch Member: We need water! Hurry! The fire's spreading!

Aerith: Ow… Marlene…

[She's looking for a way around the burning helicopter and into the bar...]

Aerith: Oh, no! Need to find another way to get there! Gotta get through. Gotta find a way. Finally!

[However, on the other side, another part of the helicopter explodes. People run away in a panic.]

Aerith: Hold on.

Undercity Resident: Go, go, go!

Undercity Resident: Quit pushing!

[The little girl falls to the ground. Aerith runs up to her.]

Aerith: Oh, you poor thing! I know it must hurt… but you've got to be brave now, okay?

Marle: C'mon, keep moving! This way! Hey! Hey! Over here! C'mon!

Aerith: I'll take you to her. Ready? 

[She takes the girl in her arms.]

Aerith: Almost there, okay? No need to rush. Steady now… 

[As if blessed or insane, she slowly carries the girl through the chaos and panic.]

Aerith: I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.

Marle: This way, people! Quickly now! Keep moving!

Aerith: Can you take care of her?

Marle: Of course.

Betty's Dad: Betty! I've been looking everywhere for you!

Betty: Daddy!

Aerith: You'll be fine.

[She turns around and walks toward the bar, in the opposite direction from the people evacuating.]

Marle: Stop! That way's already—

[But Aerith doesn't turn around. She's making her way through the crowd of evacuees.]

Aerith: Please, I need to get through! Almost there!

[The explosion of the downed helicopter lying on the ground knocks her to the ground. We switch to the view from the cockpit of the helicopter hovering over the city.]

Tseng: Confirmed, one more bird lost. Probably for the best. After all—

[He notices Aerith lying on the ground.]

Tseng: Change of plans. You can take it from here. Someone's been a little too adventurous.

[Aerith gets to her feet and keeps running.]

Aerith: Please be okay.

[She comes to the door of the bar.]

Aerith: Hold on, Marlene. I'm coming for you.

[Inside, she hears someone crying. Aerith finds a little girl hiding under the bar. She has her arms around her knees and is crying.]

Aerith: You're Marlene, right?

Marlene: Who… who are you?

Aerith: I’m… a friend! Of Tifa's!

Marlene: Um... Where is she?

Aerith: Right now, she's with Cloud and the others.

Marlene: Daddy too?

Aerith: You mean Barret? Yep. He's there too.

Marlene: Wait... Daddy's not coming home?

Aerith: Not yet. That's why I came to find you. Tifa asked me to. She said, "Take care of Marlene." The thing is, this place isn't safe now. I'm gonna take you somewhere safer, okay?

[Marlene continues to cry.]

Marlene: Are they gonna destroy the bar? Are they gonna destroy our house?

[Aerith spreads her arms apart, beckoning Marlene. She puts her arms around her.]

Aerith: I know it's hard. Just remember, you still have your daddy. You can build a new home together. Anywhere. Shall we go?

[Marlene cries and hugs Aerith. Afterwards, she feels something... like an insight and moves away from Aerith. Aerith puts her finger to her lips with a smile. Marlene approaches her again and hugs her by her dirty skirt.]

Marlene: You smell nice.

Aerith: Oh?

Marlene: Like… like our flower.

[She points to the white lily standing in the jar.]

Aerith: I hope you remember it. C'mon.

[They hold hands and walk slowly toward the exit of the bar.]

Aerith: Tell you what. We'll grow lots of flowers at your new house.

Marlene: Do you think that I could help too?

Aerith: Of course you can. Hey—what's your favorite flower?

[The bar door opens and a man in an expensive black suit with long black hair slicked back and a red spot on his forehead enters.]

Tseng: You led us on a merry chase, Aerith.

Aerith: Tseng.

[She covers herself with Marlene.]

Tseng: Before you say another word, know that your options are limited.

[Aerith turns to Marlene.]

Aerith: There's nothing to be scared of. Okay? (to Tseng) How about… we make a deal?

[Tseng smirks and asks the ladies to leave. Meanwhile, Cloud is still being fired upon as he hides behind a stack of steel beams!]

Cloud: Gotta move.

Reno: Pop your head out and let me finish this already.

Rude: Stairs.

Reno: Huh?

[Tifa runs up the stairs to Cloud!]

Reno: Two birds with one shitload of bullets!

[Rude tilts the helicopter slightly and Reno bangs his head against the door.]

Reno: Hey!

[Cloud seizes the moment and runs to the stairs.]

Tifa: Cloud!

[The leaning helicopter destroys the ladder with its machine gun. Tifa, who managed to jump, grabs hold of Cloud's hand and they hide around the corner.]

Cloud: What the hell!?

Tifa: Nice catch!

Cloud: You're crazy!

Tifa: Just like you. So suck it up, 'cause I'm not leaving.

Reno: Dammit! You wanna explain yourself, partner?

Rude: Uh... Hand slipped.

[Reno keeps shooting. Cloud and Tifa run away.]

Cloud: Where's Aerith?

Tifa: I sent her to Seventh Heaven to get Marlene out.

Cloud: And Wedge?

Tifa: I asked him to show her the way.

Cloud: Okay.

Tifa: We can still stop this… right?

Cloud: Yeah.

Tifa: Then let's keep moving!

Reno: (via loudspeaker) And where do you think you're going? I see you! Come out, come out, wherever the hell you are! Save us all some time and give up. 

[Cloud and Tifa go higher and higher, dodging fire and fighting monsters.]

Reno: (via loudspeaker) Well, if this is how you wanna play it, that's fine by me. How do you assholes like this? I don't know about you, but I am over this shit! Stay where I can see ya! Yeah, you better run! Wassup, guys! Man, you suck at hiding! You still want some more? I don't row about you, but I am over this shit!

[Claud and Tifa hear an explosion as they run to the next floor.]

Tifa: What was that?

[Several of Shinra's soldiers are blown up by a grenade exploding under their feet. Jessie comes out from around the corner.]

Jessie: So, how'd you guys rate my latest and greatest design? Eleven outta ten?

[A Shinra helicopter flies up to her with a soldier at the helm. Jessie pulls out another grenade and kisses it.]

Jessie: Today's your unlucky day ‘cause I never miss.

[She blows up the helicopter and meanwhile Cloud and Tifa continue to run away from the machine gun.]

Reno: Looks like you guys are having the time of your life. What, what?

Rude: Seems we’ve lost control of the top floor.

Reno: Huh? Our guys are seriously struggling to take down these assholes?

Rude: Anyway, we may need to intervene personally.

Reno: Whatever you say, partner. Keep 'em busy, will ya?

[Cloud and Tifa go up higher and find Jessie under the rubble.]

Tifa: Jessie!

[They run up to her and start removing pieces of metal.]

Jessie: Oh, jeez… Tifa… If you could see the look on your face...

[Cloud reaches for Jessie and takes her in his arms.]

Jessie: So… you're the guy… who gets to hear my last words… Heh... Lucky me.

Cloud: Like hell they're your last!

Jessie: It's okay. Cloud... It's okay. They were my bombs. They were all… my victims. I had it… coming.

[Cloud puts her on the floor with her back against the wall.]

Jessie: My hero. So gentle...

Cloud: Just try to hang on!

Jessie: So dramatic… I… I just wish that… I could've had you over again... Everyone... With Mom's cooking… I really wanted… to believe… we could...

Cloud: Yeah. You owe me a pizza.

Jessie: That's right. I do. But… I don't think… Oh no... Tifa's crying. Did I say something wrong? Don't you guys… have somewhere to be? It's not polite… to stare… you know...

[She dies. Her hand falls out of Cloud's hand, but he catches it up. Tifa clenches her fists.]

Tifa: Jessie...

Cloud: Hey...

[She's crying. Cloud clenches the hand he was holding Jessie with in his fist. They keep going upstairs. The stairs behind them break. They hear Barrett's sonorous voice.]

Barret: I ain’t done with you yet! You hear me!?

[He fires his machine gun on his arm at Shinra's soldiers.]

Barret: Think you can come up in here—do what you want—and we're gonna take it!?

Tifa: Barret!

Barret: Tifa!? Get your ass behind cover! Now! Chopper's gonna chew you up!

[Cloud appears next to Barrett with a sharp jog and a roll. They hide behind thick cylinders.]

Cloud: Still alive and kicking?

Barret: Damn right! Leadin' man sticks around till the credits roll!

[By opening diversionary fire, he allows Tifa to also take cover behind the cylinders.]

Barret: Though we gotta keep moving if we wanna make it that far. You ready?

Cloud: Yup.

[Finally, the cylinders explode. The heroes are thrown to the ground. Meanwhile, Reno gets up on the helicopter's ski.]

Reno: Time for a rematch, huh… Rude!

[He throws Reno the baton. The helicopter descends lower.]

Cloud: You!

Reno: It's nothing personal...bitch!

[He jumps off and attacks Cloud, but the latter blocks the attack with his sword, sending out a shower of sparks. Reno jumps away, dodging Cloud's blow.]

Reno: Missed me!

[The Rude helicopter continues to fire. Barret returns fire.]

Barret: You're next, asshole!

[Reno runs up to the computer panel.]

Reno: Sorry, losers! Gotta puy for keeps today. No time to dick around.

[Smiling radiantly, he starts typing on the keyboard.]

Announcement: Plate separation authorized. Awaiting confirmation. Plate separation authorized. Awaiting confirmation.

Reno: Yeah, yeah, coming right up.

[He prepares to press the confirmation button. Cloud swings to cut off his arm, but Reno blocks the blow.]

Reno: No you don't! Not when I'm working!

Announcement: Plate separation authorized. Awaiting confirmation.

Cloud: Press it.

Reno: Now, now...

[Barrett and Tifa run up to Cloud.]

Reno: You ain't got shit on us.

Cloud: Careful. He's quick.

Barret: Yeah, quick at runnin' away, maybe!

Reno: Ha! In your dreams. So. Heard you gave Rude a beating.

Cloud: Had to.

Reno: No choice, huh? I guess I ain't got one neither.

[The squad inflict several painful wounds on Reno.]

Reno: Stubborn little shitbirds, ain'tcha?

Rude: Prepping for bombing run, how copy?

Reno: Say what!?

[Bomb compartments open.]

Reno: I see you're doin' whatever the hell you want.

[He quickly jumps the fence and hides behind it.]

Reno: Guess I'm rubbing off on ya.

Cloud: Heads up, guys!

[The squad has to fight the Rude helicopter. He's dropping bombs.]

Rude: Run complete. Reloading.

[Reno comes out of his hiding place and attacks.]

Rude: Reno! Clear out now!

[The squad blows up the helicopter.]

Reno: Rude! Dammit...

[He sadly raises Rude’s glasses... and then his partner puts a hand on his shoulder. Reno, smiling, gives him his glasses.]

Reno: Clipped your wings, huh?

Rude: I was planning to join you anyway.

Reno: Any landing ya can walk away from… C'mon! Let's teach 'em the Turks two-step!

[The battle begins!]

Rude: Time for you to learn...

Reno: What happens when you mess with the Turks! If you're gonna pick a fight with the Turks, you'd better be prepared to leave in a body bag.

Barret: Confident, ain't we?

[The squad defeats Reno and Rude. Tifa runs up to the computer panel but she doesn't know what to do.]

Announcement: Plate separation authorized. Awaiting confirmation.

[Cloud threatens Reno with his sword. He meanwhile reaching for his baton.]

Cloud: How do we stop it?

Reno: Who knows?

[He loses consciousness. Rude takes advantage of the moment to run to the computer panel.]

Barret: Where you going!?

[He shoots at Rude, but he and Cloud are surrounded by hooded reapers.]

Cloud: Move!

Barret: Getting real tired of your shit!

[Rude knocks Tifa out with a single punch.]

Cloud: Tifa!

[Barrett tries to break through with his muscles but is unsuccessful.]

Barret: Where'dja—

[Rude presses the button.]

Announcement: Plate separation initiated. Plate separation initiated. Commencing separation sequence. Section 1 separation imminent. Evacuate immediately. Plate separation initiated.

Barret: You son of a bitch! What have you done!?

[Cloud runs at Rude with a sharp straight swing, but Rude slips under his sword.]

Cloud: Tifa!

[Barrett unsuccessfully tries to shoot the computer panel. Rude runs to his partner and, after thinking for a while, grabs him and runs to the helicopter.]

Rude: Five minutes to go.

[They fly away.]

Tifa: What do we do?

[The monitor above the computer activates.]

Tseng: Nothing. There is nothing you can do now.

Tifa: You can't do this!

Aerith: Tifa! I found Marlene!

Tifa: Aerith!

Barret: Marlene? My Marlene!? What did you do with her!?

Cloud: Where are you!?

Aerith: I'm at the—

Security Officer: Sir. C'mon.

[They take her away.]

Tseng: Your activities unwittingly brought you into contact with the Ancient, who is now back in our custody where she belongs. For this, you have my sincerest gratitude. Alas, the sector in which you stand has been condemned.

[He puts his finger to his lips.]

Cloud: "Ancient"?

Aerith: Run! You have to go now!

Tseng: And where exactly do you expect them to go?

[The broadcast ends.]

Cloud: Aerith!

Announcement: Total plate separation imminent. Evacuate the area immediately.

Tifa: No, no, no…

[She falls into a depression. Pilar begins to crumble, separating Cloud, Barrett, and Tifa.]

Barret: If we don't get the hell outta here right now, we're dead! We gotta think of something! Think dammit think! Look around... Gotta be something! Shit… shit… Shit! Hey! Found us a way out!

Cloud: Tifa.

[He grabs her hand and drags her behind him.]

Barret: C'mon c'mon!

[He shoots at the bulkhead breaking the structure, leaving only the hook on the rope.]

Barret: Now!

[He jumps off, and Cloud and Tifa cling to him. The Pilar collapses, destroying the entire Sector. The remaining people run away in panic from the explosions and destruction. Cloud, Tifa, and Barrett descend on a tether and fly over the fiery inferno. Wedge waves off the hooded reapers rescuing a cat and notices a huge wreckage falling on him. President Shinra watches it all from the window with undisguised pleasure. Suddenly a... upright cat appears... wearing a small crown and with a red rag thrown over his back and tied around his neck. Seeing the destruction, he falls to his knees and pummels his fist on the ground. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fly out of the Sector on a rope.]

Chapter 13: A Broken World
[Tifa comes to her senses in the middle of the rubble. Cloud looks at her. He helps her up and they start looking for Barret. Soon they hear a voice coming from the rubble.]

Barret: Hey! Anybody out there!?

Tifa: Barret!? I think I hear him up ahead!

Cloud: Here goes.

Tifa: And push!

[They push back the slab and see Barret looking in the direction of the ruined Sector.]

Barret: Marlene… Marlene! Marlene! (screams) Marlene! Biggs! Wedge! Jessie! Goddammit. Goddamn you! Goddamn you all!

[He screams and bangs his fist on the rubble.]

Barret: (crying) Marlene... Marlene… 

[Tifa approaches him.]

Tifa: It was us. We did this.

Barret: No. You can't think like that. Whatever came before, it was Shinra that pulled the trigger today. Am I right!?

[Tifa clenches her fists with all her might.]

Tifa: ...Yeah.

[Barret takes her hand.]

Barret: Hold on to this. This… anger. Okay?

[He hugs her.]

Cloud: Barret. Marlene's fine. Aerith found her.

Barret: Aerith? Is that the girl they took?

Tifa:  Yeah. That's her.

Barret: The hell's going on!?

Tifa: I asked Aerith to find Marlene and take her somewhere safe.

[Barret turns to Cloud.]

Barret: And she did? You sure!?

[Cloud just walks away.]

Barret: Hey! Where you going!?

[He runs after Cloud. The squad comes out to the refugees and Shinra soldiers who left the Sector.]

Barret: I said where you going?

Cloud: Aerith's house. It's in the Sector 5 slums.

Barret: And that's where Marlene is?

Cloud: Where we hope she is.

Barret: Tell me she is! Give me something to hang on to! Even if she's not. I won't blame you for it, I swear! Who am I kidding. I'd probably try to tear your head off.

Cloud: Hey, Tifa. Know anything about "Ancients"?

Tifa: I know I've heard of them at least.

Barret: They come up in planetology books. Meant to be the original stewards of the planet. Could even "commune" with it. Talk to it and stuff.

Cloud: That must be why the Turks wanted her so badly.

[Cloud gets a headache again, this time so bad that he begins to hear his voice.]

Sephiroth: Within my veins flows the blood of Ancients. This planet… is my birthright. 

[Sephiroth appears right in front of Cloud, but the other members of the squad do not see him. Cloud backs away in fear.]

Sephiroth: You have failed again, I see. But through suffering, you will grow strong. Isn't that what you want?

[Sephiroth disappears.]

Tifa: Cloud?

Cloud: It's nothing. Let's go.

[They are part of Sector 6 Slums.]

Sam: Hey. Pretty crazy, huh? Can you believe this mess?

Cloud: You doing all right?

Sam: I am, but I can't say the same 'bout my birds. Poor things’re scared half to death.

[They walk on and Cloud notices several Shinra soldiers entering the building.]

Cloud: Wait. Over there.

Barret: What the hell are they doing here?

Cloud: Their jobs, probably. Just focus on seeing Marlene again. Nothing else.

[They meet Andrea.]

Andrea: Did you find what you were looking for?

Cloud: Thanks to you I did.

Andrea: Good. Now never let it go again.

[The squad runs through piles of junk to Aerith's house.]

Barret: You guys run into Jessie at the pillar?

Tifa: Yeah… Biggs too. They were both in pretty bad shape. But Wedge wasn't up there with 'em. He got out.

Barret: All right. I’ve been thinking y’all… We gotta go find the others.

Tifa: Huh?

Barret: If we don't look for them, who will?

Tifa: ...Right.

Barret: Hey, Cloud. Gonna need your help with it too.

Cloud: Right.

Barret: This is Sector 5, right? So where's this place you said Marlene is?

Cloud: Where I think she is. It's a house on the other side of town.

Barret: Well, come on then, pick up the pace!

Cloud: I'm going as fast as you are.

Chadley: Cloud! I'm glad to see that you're okay. In these trying times I hope to develop new materia to help us endure. Cloud, I've come up with the most fascinating theory. Perhaps you can lend me your assistance in gathering data to test it? I have to tell you that I am grateful for all of your help thus far. I've done it. I've developed a new materia!

[The squad runs up to Aerith's house.]

Cloud: That's the house.

Barret: Marlene! Marlene!

[He runs into the house and yells at Aerith's mother.]

Barret: Where's Marlene!? Is she here!?

Cloud: Barret!

Barret: Sorry. I'm Barret. Marlene's my little girl. (thinks a little) Marlene—she's got short hair. She's cute as a button, with the heart of an angel. She was wearing… Uh...pink! She was wearing a pink dress today!

Elmyra: She's sleeping upstairs.

[Barret runs to the second floor.]

Elmyra: I said she's sleeping!

[Barret starts walking slowly so as not to make noise.]

Tifa: I wanna see her too. C'mon. Let's go look in on her.

Elmyra: Keep it down. Don't wake her. Maybe you should join your friend upstairs.

[They enter the bedroom.]

Barret: Marlene… my baby. Thank god.

[The squad goes down to the first floor to talk to Aerith's mother.]

Elmyra: Shinra has my daughter now.

Cloud: I'm sorry.

Tifa: No. I'm the one who asked her to go get Marlene. We'd only just met, but she was so kind and helpful. I… took advantage of her.

Elmyra: It's not your fault. It was only a matter of time before she ended up back there.

Cloud: Because she's an Ancient. That it?

Elmyra: So she told you about that? She must trust you all a great deal...

[She sits down on a chair.]

Elmyra: Yes. Aerith is an Ancient. Probably the last one living. She's not my daughter. Not by blood, I mean, If that's what you were wondering… About fifteen years ago… My husband, he'd been shipped off to fight on the front lines. But then I received a letter saying he’d be home for a bit. So when the day came, I went to the station to meet him… But… he didn't come. I couldn't help fearing the worst, even then… but I told myself his leave must've been postponed, that he'd been delayed. Every day I went, to wait and to pray… And that's how I met her. Her and her mother.

[We see a young Elmyra finding a woman lying by the station and a little girl beside her.]

Elmyra: I thought maybe they'd run away from Wall Market. Or that they were topsiders fallen on hard times. I’d seen that sort of thing a lot. “Take Aerith somewhere safe.” Those were her mother's dying words. My husband had been away for so long, and I was lonely. So I convinced myself the safest place for the girl was with me. It took no time at all for her to start feeling like family. She was a real chatterbox. She told me strange stories… Like how she and her mother had escaped from some sort of facility… And how she wasn't sad because her mother had just... "returned to their planet."

Barret: Their planet, huh? Yeah, that sounds about right.

Elmyra: I didn't understand any of it at the time. When I asked if she meant one in the sky… She said no, this one. Right here. I mean… what can you say to that...?

Young Aerith: Mommy, don't be sad.

Elmyra: That's what she said to me one day, out of the blue. So I asked her “What's wrong?”

Young Aerith: A man you really, really love just died. His heart came a long way to say goodbye. But he couldn't stay ‘cause he had to return to the planet.

Elmyra: I didn't believe her, of course. And then, a few days later, I received a letter saying my husband had been killed in action. Things like that, she'd just know. It was a lot to deal with, but we were happy. And then came the knock.

Young Aerith: Coming!

[Little Aerith comes to the door. She sees Tseng and is frightened.]

Young Aerith: No… Go away!

Tseng: Aerith… You know you’re not just a little girl. You're a descendant of the Ancients.

Elmyra: I had no idea what he meant, so I said, “Who are the Ancients?”

Tseng: They were the original stewards of the planet whose boundless knowledge and wisdom shall guide us to the promised land. Some believe the promised land to be a myth. Others, an allegory of sorts. But we take the words of the scriptures at face value, and believe it to be quite real. Which is why Shinra would like very much for Aerith to help us—

Young Aerith: You're wrong! I'm not an Ancient!

Tseng: But Aerith... Even when you're all alone, don't you hear voices whispering secrets?

Aerith: No, never!

Elmyra: But all three of us knew that wasn't true. That man knew exactly who Aerith was, where she'd come from, and what she could do. 

Cloud: They knew where she was, but they didn't just take her? Doesn't sound like the Turks I know.

Elmyra: She had to come willingly, otherwise it wouldn't work, they said. That's why… even if they did take her away, I'm sure she's still being treated like a guest… And that they'll send her straight back home once they get what they need.

Cloud: I doubt it.

[He's heading for the exit.]

Elmyra: You're not planning anything, are you? Don't make things worse than they already are. If I lost her too, I don't know if I could... If I could ever… Just don't.

Tifa: Cloud. Maybe she's right about this. Maybe they'll let Aerith go when it's all over. Maybe… we'd be better off waiting a little while.

Barret: Let's head back to Sector 7. Got things to take care of. Like… checking up on the bar.

Tifa: Yeah.

Cloud: Okay.

Elmyra: Take care of yourselves now.

[They leave Elmyra's house.]

Tifa: The main entrance to Sector 7 is buried under rubble now. So how are we supposed to get back inside?

Cloud: Underground passage in the park.

Barret: Ah, good plan.

Tifa: But how do we get to the park?

Cloud: I know another way to get there. Aerith showed me before.

Barret: Heh. This Ancient girl knows her stuff. Didn't mean anythin' by it.

[They walk in silence for a while. Cloud leads from the same route he recently took with Aerith.]

Cloud: Over there.

Barret: Alright, let's keep moving.

Cloud: It's blocked. There that way. We'll have to fight our way through, but it's our only shot.

[The journey turns out to be long and difficult.]

Barret: Finally. Those assholes were really getting on my nerves.

Tifa: Over there!

Barret: That a way out?

Tifa: I'm almost afraid to go backю To see it with my own eyes...

Cloud: Tifa...

Tifa: Come on.

[Finally they emerge into the ruins near Sector 7. Barret notices a bearded man.]

Barret: Wymer! You're alive!

Wymer: Still in one piece.

Barret: Who else made it out?

[Wymer shakes his head.]

Wymer: I wish I knew... Sorry.

Tifa: It's fine.

Barret: I'm just glad you survived. Gives me hope for the others.

[The squad walks around the neighborhood.]

Weapons Vendor: Sector 7, huh?

Barret: Yeah... Left a few things behind.

Weapons Vendor: I see. I know it's not much, but it's all I got.

[Cloud buys the few items he needs to help the poor guy.]

Item Store Owner: Never know what you're gonna run into out there. Best be prepared. Careful out there.

[The squad meets the girl who was saved by Aerith and her father.]

Betty: I really hope that all my friends are okay.

Betty's Dad: I'm sure they are, honey. Don't worry. I'm sure they are, honey. Don't worry.

[The squad is descending into the S7-6 Service Tunnel.]

Barret: Okay. Let's see what's on the other side.

[There is an explosion from above. The people hiding in the tunnel cling to each other in fear.]

Barret: Again?

Cloud: That one was a lot closer.

[They climb the stairs to the ruined Sector 7.]

Barret: (loudly) Hello! Is there anyone out there that needs some help? My god...

[Marle, meanwhile, is in charge of clearing the rubble and freeing people.]

Marle: Just a little more! Come on! C'mon!

Neighborhood Watch Member: It won't budge!

Barret: Make room!

Tifa: Marle!

Marie: You're alive!

Cloud: With me. Ready and—

[Barret, Cloud and two other men lift the giant slab. The girls pull a woman out from under the rubble.]

Barret: Great job, guys.

Undercity Resident: Thank you.

[The rescued woman cries tears of happiness while hugging Tifa.]

Marle: I can't tell you how relieved I am to see you. So. What now?

Barret: Don't know. Find something—anything—to do.

Marle: Been back to the bar yet?

Barret: No.

Marle: Maybe you should go take a look.

Barret: Okay. First the bar… then the rest.

Marle: Careful. The roads are a mess. Watch your step or you'll wind up in a hole!

Barret: (loudly) Hello! Anybody out there!? If you can hear me, say something!

Marle: I take it that little Marlene's safe and sound?

[The squad makes its way through the rubble to the bar. It is completely destroyed.]

Cloud: Tifa.

[Suddenly a container falls from above and almost kills Tifa if Cloud was not there.]

Cloud: Get back!

Barret: Shit!

[A mewing sound is heard nearby.]

Tifa: Hear that?

Cloud: That's Wedge's cat.

Barret: What?

Tifa: Let's follow it.

[Barret and Cloud pull back a wide panel.]

Barret: Ready? One, two, three!

Tifa: Is this all that's left of Wedge's place?

Barret: Hey! We're coming down! Stay right where you are! 

[The cat leads them to a hole in the ground. Once inside, the squad discovers Shinra's secret laboratory.]

Barret: Hmph. This place reeks of Shinra.

Tifa: Wedge?

Barret: Wedge!

[There is a small earthquake.]

Barret: Of all the times!

[The floor collapses and Barret finds himself at the bottom.]

Barret: Tifa! Cloud! Shout if you can hear me! Hey!

[However, they are not nearby. The exit from the room in which Barret found himself is blocked.]

Barret: If there's no path, you gotta make one.

[He shoots the rubble with his machine gun.]

Barret: Wedge... Hang in there.

[He is attacked by robots and some flying bugs.]

Barret: Must be a secret Shinra facility. How long it take 'em to build all this beneath our feet? Man… you'd think they dug halfway to hell. Just no escapin' them, is there? I'm really gonna enjoy burning it all down.

[He climbs higher and higher and soon sees Tifa.]

Barret: Tifa! Hey Tifa!

Tifa: Barret!

Barret: You okay?

Tifa: To tell you the truth, not really. I think there's a nest around here somewhere. Can you take care of it?

Barret: I gotcha.

Он стреляет в бочку над гнездом и уничтожает его взрывом.

Barret: Sorry.

Он бежит к Тифе которая явно сражается с монстрами. Он вступает в бой помогая ей.

Barret: Tifa! Where's Cloud?

Tifa: I don't know.

Barret: Well, he can take care of himself. We've got bigger issues.

[They win the battle.]

Barret: Are you all right?

Tifa: Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

Barret: All right. Gotta go find Wedge. Come on.

[He destroys the fans with his machine gun and they move on.]

Tifa: I'm afraid to ask, but did you just shoot your way in here?

Barret: Well, yeah. Worked, didn't it? If I gotta climb another damn ladder…

[They defeat a big robot with saws instead of hands.]

Tifa: Hey. You think Wedge is holding up okay?

Barret: Of course he is. He's a lot tougher than people think. Probably sleeping soundly, dreaming about his cats.

Tifa: You're right. We should treat him to a nice meal when he gets back. His choice.

Barret: Gotta stay on my toes if I'm gonna make it outta here alive.

[They make their way through until they find a thick metal door. Once through it they find Wedge lying unconscious on the floor. His cat is standing next to him, meowing.]

Barret: Wedge!

Tifa: He's okay.

Barret: You sure? Making me worry like that. I'd kick your ass if you didn't look like shit! Thank god.

Tifa: (to the cat) Thank you! Okay. Let's go.

Barret: Uh sure!

[He puts the fat man on his shoulder.]

Barret: Yup… it's you all right.

Tifa: What is this...?

[She notices something... the doors to the room begin to close.]

Tifa: Barret!

[Barret takes Wedge out the door before it closes.]

Barret: The hell is this now!?

[A creature similar to the monster from the Black Lagoon jumps out to them, only with a different, volcanic coloration. The battle begins!]

Barret: Where were you freaks hiding?

Tifa: Are they Shinra experiments!?

Barret: Hah! Well if that's the case, then it's only right we put the bastards down! Ah, of course there's more.

Tifa: You good?

Barret: Like you even gotta ask! Gettin' real tired of this shit!

[They kill the monsters one by one, but they don't seem to get any fewer.]

Barret: We gotta close that duct. Tifa, you're up!

Tifa: Okay! Cover me!

[She runs up the stairs to the second floor, but an unexpectedly attacked monster throws her down.]

Barret: Tifa!

[He picks her up and throws her to another platform on the second floor. She lands and continues to fight.]

Tifa: It's using its friends as weapons!?

Barret: You okay??

Tifa: Think so!

Barret: Tifa, watch out!

[Meanwhile, he is fighting a large monster twice his size and several smaller ones.]

Tifa: Seriously!?

Barret: Hey, Tifa! Heads up! All that's left is to deal with these freaks! 

[Tifa tries to use magic.]

Barret: The hell is that!?

Tifa: It absorbed it!?

Barret: Huh! Getting tired?

Tifa: Look!

Barret: Well, that sure looks like a weak point to me!

Tifa: Not again!

Barret: This guy really wants to see us dead. Time to go to town on this thing!

Tifa: We need to find a way to stop it!

[Suddenly Cloud jumps down from above, inflicting a deep wound on the huge monster with his huge sword.]

Tifa: Cloud!

Barret: ‘Bout time, merc!

Cloud: You're up.

Barret: Late to the party and you're giving me orders!?

[He fires a powerful charge at the wound and kills the monster.]

Barret: Hell yeah! So how'd you manage to track us down?

Cloud: Followed the trail of bullet holes. There's nobody else I know who'd leave that kinda mess.

[Barret blows a hole in the wall with his machine gun and the squad moves to the next room, filled with tanks with something inside...]

Tifa: Oh, god… were those...

Barret: People?

Cloud: Yeah. That's the Shinra I know.

[He remembers something... maybe he was one of the experiments, too...]

Tifa: Cloud?

[Suddenly a powerful stream of ghosts swoops down on them and brings them to the surface.]

Barret: What the hell was that?

Tifa: We need to get him somewhere safe. Everything else can wait until after.

Cloud: Agreed. Let's go.

[They pick up the Wedge and Barret puts it on his shoulder. Cloud is still looking toward the lab. Tifa picks up the cat.]

Tifa: Cloud.

Cloud: Good kitty.

Barret: I want you to take Wedge back for me. I'm gonna look around for the others. He made it didn't he? They could still be alive.

Cloud: I saw them both at the pillar... Jessie and Biggs. Saw… how bad they were hurt. I'm sorry, but...

Barret: Don't.

Tifa: They've returned to the planet.

Barret: They… they were supposed to return to us. But if we stop now… they'll never let us live it down. So… we carry that weight.

Chapter 14: In Search of Hope
[The squad arrives at Aerith's house.]

Barret: I'm sorry. I truly am. We had no other place to go and…

Elmyra: I would never leave a wounder man out on the street.

Cloud: Elmiyra, I know what you said, but you have to let us go after Aerith.

Elmyra: Not this again.

Cloud: We found an underground Shinra lab where they've done human testing. This wasn't the first time and it won't be the last. I know these people, and I know they're never gonna let Aerith go. She's the last living Ancient on the planet. Think about what that means to Shinra's scientists. Especially to that son of a bitch Hojo. We're all just numbers and meat to him.

Elmyra: Enough!

Cloud: But—

Elmyra: Please. I need some time to think. You've all had a long day. Why don't you go upstairs and get some rest.

[Cloud wakes up in the middle of the night and notices that the door to Tifa's room - which is actually Aerith's room - is ajar. He searches the house and, not finding her, goes outside. Tifa is standing in the middle of the lilies.]

Cloud: Can't sleep?

Tifa: No. You too?

Cloud: I heard footsteps.

Tifa: Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you.

Cloud: I'm a light sleeper. It's a SOLDIER thing.

Tifa: That flower you gave me the other night. That was from Aerith, wasn't it? I knew there was something weird going on. You, buying flowers. They symbolize reunion, believe it or not. I was curious, so I looked it up. I tried to keep it alive as long as I could. But now… it's dead and buried. (crying) Like the bar… our home… and everything else. 

[She walks over to Cloud and snuggles up to him.]

Tifa: They took everything from us. Again. 

[She is crying profusely and Cloud decides to hug her.]

Tifa: Cloud… Cloud, you're hurting me. 

[Cloud retreats and Tifa wipes away her tears.]

Tifa: It's stupid. I know that crying's a waste of time.

Cloud: That's not true.

Tifa: Thank you.

[We go back to the house.]

Barret: You've done more for us than we deserve. I won't forget this. If you ever need anything, all you gotta do is holler.

Elmyra: Happy to help out however I can.

Cloud: Elmyra.

Elmyra: …I've been thinking about what you said.

Cloud: She's calling out to me. I can feel it.

Tifa: We all can. So please. She's our friend. We have to help her.

Elmyra: I always knew it was coming. Knew that one day I'd have to say goodbye to my baby girl. But not yet. Please bring her back to me.

[Marlene comes down from the second floor.]

Marlene: Daddy.

Barret: Marlent…

Marlene: Are you going?

Barret: I'm sorry, honey. I wish I didn't have to. I wish I could be with you all the time. I really do. But if I stay here, I can't fight out there.

[He sees that Marlene doesn't understand what's going on.]

Barret: Some bad people are… trying to hurt the planet. And Daddy… Daddy and his friends are trying to stop those bad people. The slums, your friends, the whole planet—it's Daddy's job to protect it. 

[They hug. Barret puts her on his shoulder.]

Barret: And that's why I've gotta go. You remember that nice girl who came to find you? Well, now we have to go find her. And when we bring her home, you need to say thank you, okay?

Marlene: ‘Kay! That girl… She was kinda…

Barret: What?

Marlene: Nothing. You should help her.

Barret: We will.

Marlene: You'll come back… right?

Barret: Of course, I promise.

Marlene: Okay. You can go!

[The squad comes out of the house.]

Tifa: Barret…

Barret: She's tougher than me. Aight! Time to get some payback.

Cloud: Don't forget why we're doing this.

Barret: I know, I know. To rescue Aerith.

Tifa: So, how're we supposed to get topside? With everything that's happened, the trains still aren't running.

Barret: Well, we could walk along the tracks.

Cloud: The city's on high alert. All the roads and public transit have probably been locked down by now.

Barret: So what's the plan then? You know another way up?

Cloud: You mean Corneo.

[They go out into town and see Kyrie agitating the townspeople from the podium.]

Kyrie: So, after bombing Reactors 1 and 5, what do the eco terrorists do? They go for the trifecta and take out Mako Reactor 7! Another attack by amateurs who don't care about collateral damage. The sky is falling and Avalanche is to blame! But wait! Did you know Wutai is the one funding their activities!? For all their claims about fighting for the slums… they're nothing more than pawns of Wutai—puppets dancing to the tune of their foreign masters! And that's the truth! Topside news delivered straight to your ears! That'll be five gil. Five gil—come on!

Undercity Resident: Damn, man! Knew we couldn't trust Wutai to leave us alone.

Undercity Resident: It's the reactors. They want 'em, we got 'em.

Undercity Resident: Does this mean there'll be another war?

Undercity Resident: After what they've done? What choice do we have?

Kyrie: Five gil apiece—cough it up! The truth ain't free, you know!

Barret: We ain't no damn pawns of Wutai! I couldn't care less about the rest, but that shit?

[He goes to the podium to make his point, but Tifa grabs his arm.]

Tifa: No one will listen to us. There’s no point in even trying.

[She lets go of his hand.]

Tifa: I'm sorry.

Barret: Hey… Hey Tifa, listen. There's no room in this for regrets or what-ifs or any of that. All we can do is keep moving forward. Keep following this path we chose. Wherever, so we can say we did all we could.

Tifa: I know. But… right now… instead of looking forward, you need to look around. Everyone here is terrified. So I'm asking you… don't. I know we're short on time, but let's try to help out wherever we can.

Item Store Owner: I don't have all day.

Ms. Folia: Oh, Cloud! Have you seen the kids around by any chance? I haven't seen them since they left to do their patrols. I knew I should've told them to stay inside today. If you do happen to run into them somewhere, could you tell them to come back right away? I can describe them if it'd help.

Cloud: Don't worry. I'll know.

Barret: Just stay calm and wait here. Never know they might come back on their own. Okay?

Ms. Folia: Yes, of course. Thank you so very much.

Stablehand: Hey, you! Cloud, right? Said you're a merc, and a former SOLDIER at that! Listen, I hate to ask, but we've got a few runaway birds. Mind helping us find them? Poor things were so startled by that plate coming down, they just up and bolted. I'm sure they're around here somewhere, frightened and hungry. My poor birds…

Barret: Worried about 'em huh? All right. I think we can help.

Stablehand: Oh, thank you! When you find them, feed them this. There's three missing all told, and their names are Coco, Lolo, and Momo. They'll come on home once they got some food in their bellies. Good luck. I’m counting on y'all.

Materia Vendor: You hear about what happened over in Sector 7? Materia's what you want when shit hits the fan.

Weapons Vendor: Did a plate really fall? World's just too dangerous these days not to keep a weapon at your side.

Moggie: See anything you like? A pleasure as always, kupo!

Damon: It's you, my good merc! What brilliant timing you have! Oh hello there—it is a pleasure to meet you both. I'm a journalist for the Daily Buzz.

Barret: The Daily Buzz? You mean that trash filled with Shinra fluff pieces?

Damon: Well, yes, that's fair but we do get a lot of inside information because of our close ties with the company. (laughs) Curious? Here is the scoop: A certain division of Shinra—that shall remain nameless—was planning to seize Corneo's assets. But before they could, the key to his secret vault within which his misbegotten gains were securely tucked away… was stolen! And my sources tell me that the thief… is the undercity's beloved hero: the Angel of the Slums! The unidentified bandit who's been targeting anyone with ties to Shinra or Corneo! Yes, that Angel of the Slums has struck again! Well? Do I have your undivided attention now?

Barret: Kinda, but hurry it up. We don't have time for a three act play.

Damon: Then I'll make this quick. So! My good merc. You do remember where the Angel's hideout is right?

Cloud: Do you remember the death threat she left there?

Damon: Oh, that. I've decided to seek the silver lining in this case. If the Angel of the Slums deigns to take an interest in a humble reporter, then that itself would be a story!

Cloud: …What are you asking?

Damon: If you recover the stolen key, feel free to help yourself to the contents of Corneo's vault. All I want is knowledge—the identity of the Angel. So if you happen to learn anything of value, I'd be tremendously grateful to you if you passed it along.

Oates: Hey, Cloud

Barret: Hmm. Gotta be one of them lost kids.

Oates: Lost? Who said we were lost? Stupid old man.

Barret: What’d you say?

Cloud: What're you doing out here? And where's everyone else?

Oates: Well, we saw a bunch of tombstones lying on the ground, so we decided to stand them back up. And then I heard laughing coming from somewhere, and when I turned around, everyone was gone. I was alone.

[A ghostly laugh comes from somewhere.]

Oates: That! I heard that and everyone disappeared.

Cloud: Heads up!

[The squad defeats several phantoms and frees four children.]

Oates: Guys!

Boy: Oates!

Boy: Look! Cloud's here too!

Barret: So why'd you kids come out all this way?

Oates: This is where our parents are. They're resting, but we wanted to say hi. Sometimes you just wanna do that, you know?

Barret: I do.

Oates: Thanks so much for coming to find us! That's another one I owe ya! We're gonna head back to the House now. Ms. Folia probably pretty worried.

Boy: Hey Cloud, I found this on the ground. You should take it. I think it might come in handy!

Barret: Buncha little smart-asses… With good hearts.

[Then they find lost chocobos and feed them.]

Chocobo: Kweh kweh. Wark wark! Kweh kweh. Kweh!

[After that, the squad comes out to the station where they meet a familiar face. He is in trouble as usual.]

Johnny: Bro! Tifa! Damn, is it good to see you guys again.

Cloud: I told you to stop calling me that.

Johnny: Bro. I'm in serious need of your expertise. Lend me a hand?

Cloud: Fine, what?

Johnny: Truth is, I'm, uh, trying to get outta town, for, uh, reasons. Yeah, reasons. But the thing is… (start crying) I got mugged! She took it. Took it all, man! I tried to chase her down, I really did! She was real fast-like. Man, what am I gonna do? This could be the end for old Johnny boy! I'm beggin' ya help me out! Come on, bro!

Cloud: (sighs) What'd she look like?

Johnny: Bro! Uh, hold on. Lemme think—wanna get this right. She was a cutie. Black hair. Pretty sure she was wearin' a hat. And… oh yeah! She was wearing these striped stockings too.

Cloud: Kyrie…?

Barret: Which way’d she go?

Johnny: Uh, toward the church I think.

[The squad walks into the church and approaches the flowerbed where Cloud landed some time ago. Next to the flowerbed stands a girl in dark denim clothes and a baggy hat.]

Kyrie: What? It wasn’t me. You've got the wrong girl! Never committed a crime in my life!

Cloud: You Kyrie?

Kyrie: (theatrically) Kyrie? Who's that? Can't say I know her, but cool name.

Tifa: (smirks) Someone mugged our friend and took every last gil he had. Sound familiar?

Kyrie: Oh, that? I thought I was in actual trouble. Don’t scare me like that!

Barret: Now I remember you. You're that chick. The one who was spreadin' lies in Sector 5.

Kyrie: Oh yeah, I did do that. Good times, good times. Hold on, know you, blondie! You're that merc everyone's talking about! Maybe my luck's not so bad. Shinra's after me. You've gotta help me.

Cloud: Stole from them too, did you?

Kyrie: No! Well, yes, sorta─it's complicated. How was I supposed to know they were Shinra? And now those jerks won't leave me alone! Even though all I took was some ugly key. I mean, what's the big deal anyway?

Barret: Wait a minute─that was you!?

Kyrie: …Oh great. So, everyone's talking about it? (fake cry) Is this the end? Am I a dead woman? Do I have to go on the run? Leave Midgar forever and never look back?

Tifa: Kyrie, please. Just give us the money you stole from our friend, would you? And the key while you're at it.

Kyrie: (continue to fake cry) No way. You're gonna split the second I do. And then who'll protect me? I can't handle this on my own…

Cloud: (sighs) We'll handle Shinra if you give us the key. Deal?

Kyrie: (stops crying) It's a deal! Right about now, those Shinra creeps should be hanging out at the colosseum. They're waiting for a special match to start, starring yours truly. It's the talk of the town.

Tifa: You're joking!

Kyrie: Oh, I won't be there. I'm not stupid.

Barret: It's a miracle you've managed to stay alive this long.

Kyrie: I'll take that as a compliment. Now run along and clean up my mess.

[The squad gets on the wagon and goes to Sam to see if his chocobos have made it home.]

Sam: Well, that's two of the three chocobos down. Thanks a million. You sure work fast, don't you, champ? Mind tracking down that last bird for me? Heard there's a chocobo out by the collapsed expressway. That's about all that's reached my cars. I’d bet good money those wandering birds are mine.

Tifa: Do we really have to deal with Corneo again?

Cloud: Got no other choice.

Barret: What? Did you guys get into it with him or something?

Tifa: I don't wanna talk about it

Barret: Huh? Hey, Cloud, what ha—

Cloud: Don't recall.

Madam M: If it isn't Cloud.

Cloud: We're looking for a way topside. Know one?

Madarn M: Good luck with that. Security's so tight these days that not even a gnat could slip through. Wall Market's in a sorry state, too. Corneo's men are turning it upside down looking for Avalanche. The man with a gun for an arm…

Barret: What? Got a problem?

Madam M: No, but you might. Corneo's men are searching high and low for an Avalanche member who fits your description. Shinra has placed a very impressive bounty on you and your friends' heads. And a lot of people are looking to get rich.

Barret: Ain't these fools got anything better to do?

Madam M: You should also know that you and that arm of yours were spotted in the Sector 5 slums. Apparently, you were loitering in a rather lovely flower garden?

Barret: Oh yeah…? Wait!

Tifa: This is bad. Really bad.

Barret: Let's move!

Madam M: You bad boy you, associating with Avalanche.

[Cloud and the others leave. On the way, Cloud meets Chadley.]

Chadley: I hope you will continue to help me gather vital information for my research. I look forward to receiving all of your future battle intel submissions.

[After saying goodbye to Chadley, the squad leaves and passes a worker listening to music.]

Worker: This song helps me to unwind after a long day at work. You look a bit tired yourself. Here, listen.

[He gives the tape to Cloud. The squad goes to the Colosseum.]

Gatekeeper: Oh! Champ! Couldn't have picked a better time. This Kyrie chick totally flaked on her match, which means we're down a fighter. And we can't exactly pit the other guy against himself! What d'you say? Mind takin' her spot?

Cloud: I'll take it.

Gatekeeper: Sweet! You're a real Wall Market hero, man, Crowd's gonna go wild when they see you!

[Cloud enters the arena.]

Beastmaster: The hell you doin' here!? Where's the girl, Kyrie! That thievin' little pip-squeak!

Barret: Guessin' he's the guy she's runnin' from.

Cloud: Kyrie's not coming. You'll have to make do with us.

Beastmaster: Whatever. I can roll with it. After all, you and me, we got unfinished business!

Gatekeeper: In a shocking turn of events, our next bout is now a grudge match! Which of these two will claim victory in today's Angel Cup!? Fighters… begin!

[Cloud's squad wins the battle.]

Gatekeeper: Our reigning champion does it again! Not only does he retain his crown, but now he can add beast whisperer to his list of impressive achievements!

Barret: Hah! That wasn't too much trouble.

Gatekeeper: Watching you guys fight gave me goose bumps. Hope your next match is even better than the last!

[Cloud's squad returns to the ruined church to Kyrie.]

Kyrie: So, how'd it go?

Cloud: Well enough. If they're smart, they won't send anyone else.

Kyrie: Really!? That is so good to hear!

Barret: Learn your lesson, girl?

Kyrie: Totally! From now on, I only steal from the right people.

Barret: That ain't the lesson.

Kyrie: Talk about a weight off my shoulders. Oh, I completely lost track of time! I'd better get going.

[An old woman enters the church.]

Mireille: Hold it!

Kyrie: Grandma!? Why're you here?

Mireille: You, young lady, are gonna hear about this later. Thank you for keeping her out of trouble.

Tifa: She say "grandma"?

Mireille: What? Did I forget to mention it to you? Kyrie's my granddaughter—my flesh and blood. See? We even have the same eyes. Kyrie, the key. You've kept them waiting long enough.

Kyrie: Yeah, yeah.

[She gives the key to Cloud.]

Kyrie: What's it for, anyway? Why do you guys want it?

Mireille: And how's that any of your business, young lady? Learn to wipe your own ass before you start rooting around in other people's shit.

Kyrie: Ugh, Grandma! Cut it out. You're embarrassing me.

Mireille: Me embarrass you? Says the girl who steals from anyone. Even a thief needs principles, not to mention the courage of convictions to follow their conscience. Take it from me—the Guardian Angel of the Slums.

Tifa: Wait a minute—you're the Angel!?

Mireille: And you three are Avalanche. There's a fire in you. I can see it flickering in your eyes. That same fire's in me, too. The Guardian Angel of the Slums, Avalanche—they're just names. We are who we choose to be. But you crave to decide who that is, and commit. Make the most of your time while you still have it. Right?

[Kyrie leaves.]

Mireille: I hear Corneo's got secret rooms hidden in the sewers. More than even he knows, if the rumors are true.

[The unit returns to Johnny to give him the wallet.]

Johnny: My wallet! My precious wallet! You really did it, bro! knew I could count on you.

Cloud: For the last time, don't call me that.

Johnny: Thank you. Now I can get outta town.

Tifa: You're leaving?

Johnny: Hush, Tifa. Don't try to stop me. I'm a wanted man in these parts. If I stayed I'd be a danger to you too.

Tifa: Uh, okay…

Johnny: But if you begged me to stay, I could reconsider throwing everything away—

Tifa: Good luck out there, Johnny.

Johnny: Oh, er… okay.

Tifa: You'll be fine wherever. You're Johnny—don't forget!

Johnny: Uh, yeah… hell yeah, I am! I'm your Johnny, Tifa. And nothing's gonna bring me down! Bro, Tifa, keep on shinin'. Johnny out!

[He runs away. The squad goes in search of the lost chocobos.]

Chocobo: Wark wark. Kweh kweh.

[They feed the poor guy.]

Chocobo: Wark!

Barret: Okay then! That makes three.

Cloud: We'd better check in at Sam's.

[They go back to the stables.]

Stablehand: Well, that's all three missing birds! Dunno what I would've done without y'all! Now we can get back to business! Oh─and Sam wants you to swing by the stables when you can. I think he said something about wanting to "thank you properly."

[Afterwards, the squad heads to Aerith's house.]

Housemother: Oh Cloud! Thank goodness you're here. A group of Corneo's men just came through─headed for Aerith's place.

[They go out to a wide area not far from the house where they see three bandits.]

Corneo Lackey: Hey, it's him! Gun-arm!

Barret: Heard you punks were lookin' for me. Didn't wanna keep you waitin'.

Corneo Lackey: Wait! You!?

Hoodlum: Should've known you were one of 'em!

Cloud: But am I?

Hoodlum: Whatever─enough of this bullshit! Hey, let 'em loose.

Corneo Lackey: Uh, sure!

[A cute little green creature in a brown hood comes out to the squad. The creature looks a bit like a frog. It has a small lamp in one paw and… a kitchen knife in the other.]

Hoodlum: Y'all are in for a world of hurt now! Hack 'em to bits, y'hear me! Leave the faces, though. Shinra ain't gonna give us the bounty otherwise!

[The squad has to fight the green creature, which proves to be a formidable opponent. The bandits kneel to beg for mercy.]

Hoodlum: We give up, okay!? We won't say a word to no one about you bein' here. Really─honest!

Cloud: That's right. You'll tell everyone we were never here─that the rumors were bullshit. And if we hear about you, or any of your friends, coming round here ever again…

Tifa: You'll answer to my boot.

Hoodlum: Yessir! Er, miss!

[They run away in shame. The squad continues to explore the city and meets the doctor.]

Doctor: Hey, I know you. You're Aerith's bodyguard. I could really use her help. She always knew where to find the best herbs, and… You haven’t seen her, have you? I used up all my meds treating people injured when the plate fell, you see. I could make more, but not without those herbs.

Cloud: So what do you need?

Doctor: You mean you're willing to help me out? Oh, thank you! You'd be doing this town a huge favor. Here's a list of everything I'm looking for.

Wymer: Oh, hey Barret.

Barret: Hey, how's it going?

Wymer: Could be better. I’ve got a good number of watchmen out looking for survivors. But as much as I’d love to join them, I've got another mess on my hands at the moment. Remember those rumors about a lab? They're true. There is one—hidden underground somewhere, and it's full of monsters. So, Cloud… think you can lend us a hand with it? It’s only a matter of time before these monsters come calling. I know it's a dangerous job but—

Cloud: But no one else can do it.

Wymer: Well, yeah. So help us out.

[The squad goes to an underground laboratory by going through the tunnels where people are hiding.]

Neighborhood Watch Member: We've been getting tremors ever since last night. Roads are collapsing, and sinkholes are opening up all over.

[They descend lower and lower until they encounter a Type-0 Behemoth. The battle with him is not easy, because the giant monster is agile and very strong, but the squad still manages to win.]

Barret: Yeah! That's how it's done.

[After taking everything they need, they go up to the surface.]

Wymer: You took care of those monsters? Oh, thank you! That's one less big problem to worry about. We owe you.

Barret: I know it's tough right now, but stay strong, y’hear?

Wymer: You too, buddy. But hey, we're grounders. We don't break easy. I know it's not much, but take this, with my thanks.

[After saying goodbye, they go to the doctor to give him the supplies.]

Doctor: Oh! Did you manage to get everything I needed? Thank you. This oughta be more than enough. I can see why Aerith put her trust in you. Don't worry. I'll take it from here. You've done more than your fair share already. Here, take this. I'm betting it'll come in handy.

[The unit leaves and meets the little girl at the old jukebox.]

Betty: Oh, heya!

Tifa: Betty, I'm so glad to see you're okay.

Betty: You too! Uh, where's Marlene? Is she okay?

Barret: Don't worry. She's safe.

Betty: Really? I'm so glad! Hey, can you help me with something? I'm looking for music disc for the jukebox. I think some new music might cheer people up—make them happy!

Tifa: That's a wonderful idea.

Barret: Okay! If we find any music discs, we'll bring 'em straight to you. You just promise to crank up the volume, all right?

Betty: You know I will. Thanks! I just want people to smile more. Thanks a bunch! Hope you guys find some really good ones.

[The squad goes to the bar.]

Old Man: It's not right, me getting out…

Woman: Hngk…

[The unit goes inside and finds the musician there.]

Guest: There's nothing quite like kicking back and letting the music flow through you. What's that? You wanna get in on my flow?

[He gives them a CD of his records. After that, they meet with Sam.]

Sam: There's the champ with a heart of gold! My babies are all back home, safe and sound. Now I can finally get back to the business of business. Thanks, partner. Here, y'all earned this. It's a pass that'll get you a ride on one of my carriages whenever you need it─free of charge, of course. Not bad, am I right? Chocobos're somethin' else. You can ride 'em, pet 'em, befriend 'em. What would we do without 'em? They're the reason a guy like me can keep a roof over his head in a town like this─and that's no lie. I wouldn't blame ya for doubting that coming from me, but it is what it is.

[The squad continues to walk around the city looking for people who need help.]

Souvenir Shop Owner: With these babies, you can send intruders flying! I guarantee this is the only home protection you'll ever need! Only a few left. Get yours while you can!

Woman: Hey, what's up man! You vibing with this jam too? You can have a copy if you want.

[She gives them her records. After getting enough music albums, the answer goes back to Betty.]

Betty: Thanks a bunch!

[Cloud puts a heavy metal CD in the jukebox.]

Betty: Wow, what a song! It makes me feel like I can do anything!

Man: Yeah…yeah! I can feel this song calling to my inner warrior. Yeah, I can take on the world! It's time I took action, made a stand!

Barret: Hell yeah, that's it! That's the fire we need right now! Be a force for change, brother!

[Cloud puts a CD of classical music into the jukebox, or rather it is some variation on the main theme of the franchise.]

Betty: Ooh, I like this one. It's really peaceful, don't you think?

Woman: Um… Is it okay if I stay and listen for a bit? This song is a favorite of mine.

Betty: Sure!

[Cloud inserts the CD with the song on it.]

Betty: I know this one! Marlene and I danced to it before.

Old Man: That's wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! This is how you get down with this jam. I oughta know—it was my favorite back in the day! Pay attention kiddo! It's all in the hips!

[He begins to dance.]

Betty: Wow!

Old Man: (laughs) C'mon, little lady. Why don't you give it a whirl?

Betty: Isn't this great!? Everyone's smiling again. Thanks so much for the help!

Tifa: Our pleasure. I think we needed it too.

[Barret hums the classic victory fanfare iconic in the series!]

Barret: Until the day our victory fanfare rings out through all of Midgar, our battle will rage on! Heh, I'm just kidding.

[The squad goes to the gym where Andrea exhausts herself by working out.]

Jules: It's been hours now—don't you think you've done enough? Believe me, I ought to know.

Andrea: No… not yet…

Ronnie: Andi…

Andrea: Cloud… How are you?

Cloud: I was hoping you knew a way we could get topside.

Andrea: Hmm… Sorry, but it's… not possible… Well, well. What do we have here? I can see you're someone who likes to train, to be their very best.

Tifa: Me?

Andrea: Your physique: slender, yet toned. And that perfectly balanced symmetry. I can tell from a glance that you learned from the best there is. But your muscles look tight, which can only mean one thing—you're conflicted.

Cloud: Tifa?

Jules: Excuse me. You're Tifa, right? While you're here, wanna give Andi a run for his money? Work up a sweat, release some endorphins. It's the answer to everything. I promise.

Andrea: I'm in… if you are. All right then. The winner will be the one who does the most pull-ups.

[Tifa wins the competition.]

Tifa: Gotta learn from this for next time!

Andrea: …It seems you've bested me, Tifa.

Tifa: I can't believe I won.

Andrea: Your fiery passion pushed me to my limits and helped me to overcome my lingering stress and fatigue. I'll be taking the stage tonight in the best condition of my life. Thank you.

Tifa: No, thank you for… the same!

Andrea: To commemorate the evening. I would be honored if you joined me onstage for a performance someday.

[He laughs and leaves. The squad goes to the Corneo office.]

Barret: No one's home.

[When they go inside, Cloud senses danger and draws his huge sword, which ends up at Leslie's throat. Leslie himself draws his gun at the same time as Cloud.]

Leslie: Long time no see. What brings you back here?

Tifa: Well, we need to find a way to get topside as quickly as possible, and we figured Corneo oughta know one.

Leslie: Is that so… In that case, I can help.

Barret: You serious? Then tell us!

Leslie: Follow me.

Cloud: Let's just hear him out.

[They enter Corneo's bedroom. Barret notices an open hatch in the floor…]

Barret: So… what's the deal with the hole?

Leslie: Unfinished business. If you three give me a hand with it, I'll give you what you need to get topside.

Tifa: You want us to go back into the sewers with you? What's down there!

Leslie: Corneo's hidey-hole. That's where I'm headed.

Barret: You're not gonna try to screw us over, are you?

Leslie: If that's what you think, walk away. I'll find somebody else to work with. And you'll have to find another way to get topside.

Cloud: All right. We're in.

Barret: Say what?

Cloud: He betrays us, he dies.

Leslie: Fine by me.

Tifa: He means it.

Leslie: I'll tell you more after we've climbed down. When you're good to go, let me know. You guys ready?

Yes ✓
No

Leslie: Okay. Follow me.

Barret: Seriously—what's the deal with the hole?

Cloud: It's a trap for the don's enemies.

Barret: What?

Leslie: No one's ever gotten out alive. Well. Until recently that is.

[They go down the sewers.]

Barret: You are gonna hold up your end of the bargain, right?

Leslie: Long as you hold up yours yeah.

Barret: I don't trust you, and I don't like you. So if you so much as breathe in a suspicious way… I'll turn that face of yours into a honeycomb.

Leslie: I'd save your bullets for the monsters, if I were you. Some are a lot tougher than you'd think. Hate to say it, but I can barely take 'em on my own. You, on the other hand, shouldn't have any trouble, am I right?

Cloud: Let's get this over with.

[The squad walks through dark and dirty sewer tunnels flooded with poisonous green light.]

Leslie: Head for the trunk line—it marks the border with Sector 7. You three lead the way. I'll follow a short distance behind.

[He stays in the tunnel, and the group continues forward. For a while they travel in silence, battling monsters and climbing higher and higher. Barret notices graffiti of dogs frolicking in the snow on the wall.]

Barret: The mark of Avalanche. Right. Jessie and Biggs stashed a skeleton key down here.

Tifa: I never got the chance to thank them for what they did.

Cloud: Tifa…

Tifa: Let's just keep moving, okay?

Leslie: Hate to interrupt, but the trunk line's just through that door. The one over there.

Barret: Yeah, we heard you.

[They go further and enter the closed part of the sewer.]

Barret: Made it. 'Bout time.

Leslie: This way. There should be a door with Corneo's mark on it around here somewhere.

Tifa: Hey… wasn't this locked before?

Leslie: Your time to shine. Clear the path ahead, would you?

Barret: Yeah, yeah…

Tifa: Can I ask you something? Why did you help us out before? You could've lost everything.

Leslie: Andrea. He told me to.

Tifa: That really it?

Leslie: And I couldn't bring myself to let it happen again…

Tifa: Huh?

Leslie: It doesn't matter. Let's go.

[They go into one of the corridors.]

Leslie: Wait. We're getting close to Corneo's hideout. From here on, I'll take the lead.

[They come to a closed door.]

Barret: This it?

Leslie: Yeah.

Cloud: So how we supposed to get topside?

Leslie: Through here.

Cloud: Then you're telling me we're not done?

Leslie: Sorry guys, but it's not that simple—

[Suddenly he is attacked by a small pig-like monster named Abzu Shoat. He pushes Leslie, causing something to fall out of his pocket. Abzu Shoat grabs it and runs away.]

Leslie: No… Wait! We gotta catch him!

Tifa: Huh?

Leslie: He took the key to the door. Without it, we're screwed!

Cloud: Let's go.

[They're running after the little nimble monster!]

Barret: Bastard went that way!

Leslie: Shit! Don't lose him!

Barret: Where in the hell did that thing run off to?

Leslie: Up. As if this wasn't enough fun already. The area up ahead—it's that thing's den. Keep your eyes peeled. You never know when its friends're gonna pop up, or where.

Barret: We ain't got time to play hide-and-seek, ya little shit!

[The squad runs fighting monsters along the way.]

Barret: Gotcha now! I'm not gonna hurt ya, little fella. So just stay st—

[However, the monster escapes again.]

Cloud: Take the right.

Tifa: I'm on it.

Barret: Your days're numbered, ratboy!

Tifa: He's so slippery!

Cloud: Just like his owner.

[Cloud defeats Abzu by catching him and striking him with his huge sword. He picks up the small brown pouch that fell from the monster and opens it, pulling out the key.]

Leslie: Give it back!

Tifa: That's…

Leslie: Give it back.

[Cloud gives Leslie what was in the pouch. It's a small gold pendant in the shape of a flower.]

Barret: That's not a key.

Leslie: Sorry.

Barret: That's not your pendant either. Were they family?

Leslie: No…

[The scene changes to Leslie's memories. He's talking to a girl.]

Leslie's Fiancée: It was all just a dream, wasn't it… But one day… No. Time to wake up. And forget.

[She walks away leaving him the pendant.]

Leslie: Six months ago… On that day Corneo picked her as a bride. And on the next she vanished without a trace. But before she did, she gave it back. Salt on the wound. Thing cost ima small fortune.

Tifa: Why did you wanna come down here?

Leslie: Revenge. I know I need to let go, but I can't. I need closure, 'cause without it… I'll never be able to move on.

Cloud: It's fine. As long as you get us topside, we're still in.

Leslie: Thanks. And don't worry, I got you.

[Barret pats him on the shoulder.]

Barret: You all right.

Leslie: I know a shortcut. Follow me.

Barret: That twisted piece of shit. I'm gonna enjoy beatin' him to a pulp.

Leslie: Corneo's mine, and mine alone.

Barret: Huh?

Leslie: Please.

Cloud: Fine.

Barret: Okay then. Y'all think we got everything? Question is: now what? It's not gonna be easy selling this stuff.

Tifa: Oh I know. What about Marle? We could ask her to help. I'm sure she'd be happy to.

[The squad comes to the door that leads to the outside.]

Leslie: Wait outside.

Barret: Think the kid's gonna be okay goin' it alone?

[Leslie comes out alone in a wide area.]

Leslie: It's Leslie! Got some urgent info for the don!

[Corneo looks out from behind the boxes.]

Don Corneo: Oho? Come alone?

Leslie: 'Course.

Don Corneo: Really? Without my little Avalanche kittens? I thought I told you to round this to me.

Leslie: Actually… it's them I came to talk about.

[Corneo gestures to him to come closer. Leslie slowly approaches with the gun at his back. When he comes close Leslie reaches for the gun but Corneo sharply intercepts his hand and takes the gun away before punching Leslie in the stomach. Corneo looks at the gun with interest.]

Don Corneo: Leslie. I don't think I need to remind you why I'm down here. Spilling the beans to those three escape artists was a serious mistake. And now I'm on Shinra's shitlist! The plate stunt was meant to be an unprecedented tragedy claiming countless innocent lives… But those naughty little kittens organized an evacuation and screwed up the plan. I'll let you in on a secret. Shinra's going to abandon Midgar… and build something close to paradise. I was invited to be a part of it—don of a new and improved Wall Market. I'll be lucky to live another week. Leslie… I was gonna let you run your own place—give you a piece of the action. What a shame. Pop quiz time, kiddo! Villains like us only divulge our evil plans… in a certain situation. But what is that situation, hm?

Leslie: When you think… you've already won.

[Corneo puts a gun to Leslie's head.]

Don Corneo: Goodbye.

[At that moment Cloud puts his huge sword to his throat.]

Cloud: Think again, Don.

Don Corneo: Oho! It's you!

Barret: You were talking 'bout the Sector 7 plan. Keep talking, asshole.

Don Corneo: Ahh! Over there! Over there, look!

Barret: Don't try to bullshit us!

Don Corneo: But that's the thing! It's not technically bullshit when it's true.

[A tangible earthquake begins. A huge horned monster named Abzu jumps out at the squad. Yes, yes—it's the father or mother of those pig-like monsters. It kicks Leslie away, while the don runs away.]

Don Corneo: Good Abzu! Feel free to play with your food! Don out…

Barret: Bastard!

Cloud: First him, then Corneo.

[The squad defeats the huge monster and its offspring. Cloud runs up to Leslie.]

Cloud: You okay?

Leslie: Where's Corneo?

Barret: Sorry. Bastard got away.

Leslie: It's fine. I'll track him down eventually. Not like I have anything better to do.

Tifa: You know, I wouldn't be so sure about that. She could still be out there.

[She hands him the pendant that fell out of her pocket.]

Barret: Can never be sure how much someone means to va till they're gone. Don't give up on her yet.

Leslie: Was it a message? What was she trying to tell me?

Tifa: "We'll meet again."

Leslie: Huh?

Tifa: It's a symbol of "reunion."

Leslie: Then I guess I've got no choice but to find her first. Thanks.

Barret: Hold up. I think ya might be forgetting something.

Leslie: I haven't. Found it. Let's get outta here. And then I'll give you what you need.

[He takes a bag of some kind and goes up to the surface with it. The squad follows him.]

Barret: Ahh! Taste that sweet Midgar smog!

Leslie: This way.

[He goes through the bag he took with him and pulls out some kind of gun.]

Leslie: Grappling guns. You can practically fly with the souped-up motors on the babies. Sector 7 is on the other side of that wall. The guns' get you over and past it, along with any number of other obstacles. But—they're one-way tickets. So once you start up, there's no coming back. You should probably get your affairs in order. Just in case.

Tifa: Thank you.

Barret: Didn't tell you before, but we're looking for someone too.

Leslie: That right? Hope you find 'em.

Cloud: You too.

Barret: Let's go.

[The squad returns to Marla and gives her the items they found.]

Marle: Oh, what brings you here? 

Cloud: Gifts from an angel. 

Tifa: They're to be used to help the people of Sector 7 rebuild.

Marle: The Angel of the Slums? You didn't meet her, did you? Tell me, what was she like?

Cloud: Never met her. Just her go-between.

Marle: A shame. Bless her sweet soul… I don't know what to say… I'll make sure the funds are put to good use. Here, why don't you take this? Something tells me you can use it more than me. There, not too shabby now, is it?

[Afterwards, they purchase the necessary equipment and go to the wall.]

Barret: Ready to do this? Once we start up that wall, we won't be comin' back here any time soon.

[Cloud agrees to start climbing.]

Barret: So… when this is over, you gonna go on being a merc?

Cloud: That's the plan.

Barret: Reckon it suits you.

Tifa: Yeah, it does.

Barret: Used to think you were a little shit with a big attitude and a bigger inferiority complex. Quite possibly the worst person I have ever met. But that was before I figured you out. All this? It ain't you.

Tifa: Deep down, you're a pretty nice guy. Didn't see it when we were kids, but…

Cloud: Don't know about any of that, but kindness is no use on the battlefield. If anything, it's a liability.

Barret: Hey, no one's asking you to treat Shinra with kid gloves.

Tifa: Aerith's up there waiting for us.

Barret: Then we better get a move on, huh?

Cloud: Ready?

[They pull out the Grappling Guns and climb the wall, ending up in the destroyed Sector 7.]

Chapter 15: The Day Midgar Stood Still
[Barret looks around.]

Barret: Two goals! Goal one! Kick some Shinra ass and save the planet! Goal two! Save the girl—while kicking more Shinra ass—and get out!

Cloud: Copy.

Barret: Gotta be careful. No tellin’ what's gonna collapse or when.

[Part of the building on the right side of the squad is destroyed by a metal structure that fell on it.]

Barret: See what I mean?

Neighborhood Watch Member: Hey, you guys might wanna turn around.

Tifa: A friend of ours needs help.

Neighborhood Watch Member: It's too dangerous.

Cloud: For you, maybe.

Neighborhood Watch Member: Just try to be careful.

[The squad goes through the ruins fighting monsters and climb to the top of a tall building.]

Tifa: So that's where we have to climb?

Barret: If it comes apart while we're up there…

[He makes a funny sound signifying falling down.]

Cloud: We've made it through worse, you know.

Barret: Yeah, no kidding, It’s a miracle we haven't been killed a dozen times over now. It's a dead end.

Tifa: Wonder if this rope belongs to search and rescue.

Barret: Think we might be able to climb up here. 

Tifa: Time for the grappling guns. Try to aim for that part of the rope that's hanging there.

Barret: Don't screw up and fall. By the way, how well you do with this grappling gun will tell us a whole lot about you.

Tifa: (smirks) Just remember, we can't come back down. Are you ready?

Barret: I think I see a rope hanging off the top there.

[The squad uses their guns to get higher.]

Barret: Too easy. This keeps up, I'm gonna get bored.

[Meanwhile, Cloud looks around and signals the others to hide. Outside there are several robots and military men flying around with propellers attached to their arm. One of them with machine guns on his limbs is called The Valkyrie.]

Cloud: Kill team.

Barret: We can take 'em.

[Cloud, however, stops him.]

Cloud: We need to stay on mission.

Barret: I know. Saving Aerith is our top priority.

[The squad continues through the dilapidated building and bumps into a soldier.]

3-C SOLDIER: You... You're Avalanche!

[Having won the squad continues to move.]

Tifa: Come on! We need to get inside!

Barret: Why don't we use our grappling guns to get up there? Jump over all this shit.

Cloud: Not much choice.

[They use their pistols to climb higher, but the damaged building doesn't hold them and the floor collapses beneath their feet. The squad finds itself right in front of several soldiers!]

Security Officer: What the—!?

Security Officer: It's them! Avalanche!

Security Officer: 2-3, this is 1-4—we have contact!

Barret: I guess everybody and their mother knows we're here now.

[The squad has to fight its way through.]

Security Officer: Goddamn traitors!

Security Officer: Take 'em down!

Security Officer: There they are!

Security Officer: Stop 'em!

Security Officer: Surround 'em!

Security Officer: Targets spotted.

Tifa: They'll be coming for us now.

Barret: Well, to hell with being subtle!

[They go out to another building.]

Tifa: What do you think? Can we climb it?

Barret: Sure—with a grappling gun.

Tifa: I just hope that this time it holds.

Barret: I think I see a rope hanging off the top there.

[The squad climbs to the top of a giant steel tower.]

Barret: Dammit. If any of this crumbles, we're all going down.

Tifa: No...

Barret: Don't you ever forget this view. Just thinkin' about bustin' into Shinra HQ's got me fired up!

Cloud: Save some for later.

Barret: No need, son. I've got more than enough to keep me goin' for days.

[The unit continues with all sorts of robots.]

Barret: This the only way!?

[The squad enters a vast area on which temporary housing for workers has been set up. Suddenly a flying robot with two machine guns, The Valkyrie, which we saw earlier, appears.]

Cloud: Hide!

Barret: That son of a bitch is back!? I thought we lost him!

[The robot does not stop the intense fire and tears off one of the sheets of the container's shell, behind which the heroes are hiding.]

Barret: Dammit! Looks like there's only one way to go.

Cloud: We were headed that way anyway.

[Hiding behind containers from machine gun fire, they get to the other side of the tower and begin to descend.]

Barret: You want some of this? Then come get it!

[After a while, they stop to look at the panorama of the ruined Sector.]

Tifa: Cloud...

Barret: I guess… we'll build another bar.

Tifa: Yeah. We will. You'll help too, won't you?

Cloud: For a price.

[Barret and Tifa smile. Soon The Valkyrie catches up with them again.]

Cloud: Run!

Barret: Run, dammit, run! Move your ass! Shit! Look out! Was gettin' tired of playing tag anyway!

Cloud: C'mon!

[They get into a fight with The Valkyrie! The robot, however, starts firing missiles and the heroes have to run away.]

Cloud: You okay!?

Tifa: Cloud!

[Cloud jumps onto one metal beam and Barret and Tifa onto another. A rocket hits their beam and it collapses.]

Cloud: Grab on!

[He uses his grappling gun to save them both.]

Barret: That was close!

Cloud: It's not done with us yet.

Barret: Yeah, I hear ya. Let's blow the bitch outta the sky!

[The battle continues until The Valkyrie stops and fires some kind of missile into the air.]

Barret: What the hell!?

[The robot continues to fight again, even though it seemed to be damaged.]

Barret: Oh you gotta be shittin' me.

Cloud: Don't get caught in the open.

[The squad finally defeats The Valkyrie.]

Barret: (laughs) We win again. Not that there was ever any doubt! Now what?

Cloud: Shit!

[The defeated robot explodes, destroying the slab on which the heroes are standing. Tifa slides down. Cloud goes after her and catches her with his grappling gun. Barret clings too, but goes down.]

Cloud: Tifa!

Tifa: Barret!

[She shoots a hook into Barret and he catches him. Cloud climbs up onto the platform and pulls Barret out with Tifa.]

Barret: There's such a thing as too much excitement.

Tifa: Yeah. And there's still more to come.

Barret: Guess so.

Cloud: Hope everybody's warmed up.

[The climb to the top of the tower continues.]

Chapter 16: The Belly of the Beast
[Cloud, Tifa and Barret make their way to Shinra's headquarters. The area is full of roadblocks and armed soldiers. Cloud looks at the ominous building, like the cover of the original game. Meanwhile, a truck pulls into the base.]

Security Officer: That's good.

Barret: Rolled out the welcome wagon.

Tifa: Gotta say, I can't help but wonder if this is a lost cause.

Barret: Well, ya know, some lost causes are worth fighting for.

Cloud: Let's just think this through.

Barret: So. I got an idea. Frontal assault, guns blazing. Make for a good story.

Cloud: Why'd we bring you along again? Rear entrance. We'll get inside via the parking garage.

Tifa: Security's looking pretty tight.

Barret: Ha! So they know what they're up against.

Cloud: Somehow I don't think it's all for us. Could be for Avalanche. Or maybe even Wutai.

Barret: Can't be for Wutai. What about the cease-fire?

Cloud: What only put the war on pause.

Barret: Either way, I'm gonna put the fear of Avalanche in 'em! Their days of sittin' smug in this glass tower are over!

Cloud: We're here to rescue Aerith, remember? We don't need more attention than what we're gonna get. We need to be smart.

Barret: Yeah, I hear ya! But my soul's screamin' for payback, you know? I'm a tickin' time bomb and sooner or later I’mma have to blow up!

Cloud: Well, then make it later.

[They go out to the road.]

Tifa: That one there—that's a Shinra truck, isn't it?

Cloud: C'mon.

[A truck drives up to the checkpoint of the underground station and our squad stands on its roof in such a way that even a blind man can see them. But not the Shinra soldiers. They sluggishly check the bottom of the truck and let them through the checkpoint.]

Security Officer: How's it looking out there?

Security Officer: Anything?

Security Officer: Nah.

Security Officer: All clear!

Security Officer: Roger. Okay, head on in!

Barret: So far, so good.

[As soon as the truck pulls off, forgetting to grab onto something, he falls off the truck right on top of the soldier. The rest of the squad has to engage in combat.]

Security Officer: Where'd you come from!?

Security Officer: Hey, what's going on!?

Security Officer: Halt!

Security Officer: Show me your hands!

Barret: Ha! Bring it on!

Cloud: The idea was to not get noticed.

Barret: Stealth ain't my style.

Cloud: You never planned to be stealthy in the first place.

Barret: Don't remember. Maybe, maybe not. It's feelin' like a proper party now!

[They make their way through a garage filled with vehicles and various crates.]

Cloud: Let's keep moving. Should be a service entrance in the back.

SOLDIER: Intruders! Get 'em!

Security Officer: Huh!? Who's that!?

Security Officer: Get them!

Security Officer: That's far enough!

SOLDIER: There's no way out. Surrender!

[They defeat the soldiers guarding the warehouse.]

Tifa: Sure hope no one else knows we're here.

Cloud: Come on. We need to move.

[They walk out into the central lobby. The building, huge in size, seems empty.]

Barret: Nobody's home.

Cloud: Yeah.

Tifa: Do you have any idea where they might be holding Aerith?

Cloud: I'm thinking a research facility. That'd make the most sense.

Barret: And where is that?

Cloud: Upper floors… maybe near the top... That's what you are.

Barret: Maybe!?

Tifa: Maybe we can use the console at the reception desk to find out. This building's incredible.

Barret: Hah! A shining monument to corporate greed. One of these days I'm gonna tear it down and burn the rubble.

Cloud: But not today.

Barret: Yeah, yeah.

[They approach protective energy barriers.]

Tifa: I don't know about you, but I don't think we should try touching it.

Barret: Shit. Making life hard.

Cloud: Let's just keep heading up.

Barret: So, how do we get upstairs?

Cloud: Either the elevator or the emergency stairwell.

Barret: Isn't the lab we're looking for on one of the top floors? I vote we take the elevator. No getting upstairs without a keycard, huh?

Tifa: Think we're gonna need a few before this is over.

Cloud: Pretty sure I saw one lying around.

[He notices a key card lying on the reception desk, but the reception itself is covered by a security barrier.]

Barret: The reception desk!

Cloud: Yeah, but how to get in?

Tifa: Go up and over, maybe? Look. Pretty sure we could reach it, if we hop across those lights.

Barret: I don't know...

Tifa: I think I'll give it a shot. As the lightest one here, I figure I've got the best chance. You two can sit back and watch. Okay guys. Wish me luck.

[The control switches to Tifa. She starts jumping on platforms suspended above the ceiling.]

Barret: You be careful.

Tifa: Aren't I always?

[At the very end she slips off but falls on the soft couch.]

Cloud: Tifa!

Barret: Oh shit! Tifa!

Cloud: Are you okay!?

Tifa: I thought I was dead for sure!

[Dexterous and flexible, Tifa finds another way to reach the platforms - she climbs on decorative grates suspended above the ceiling.]

Tifa: Hand over hand, huh? That's fine, bring it on. This isn't so bad. Pretty close now. Just need to make it over there. Almost there. Just need to get across those platforms.

[Tifa manages to jump into reception and pick up a card. Cloud and Barret approach her.]

Barret: That's some fine work!

Tifa: I might be able to disable security from here.

[Barriers are turned off.]

Barret: Hot damn, girl!

Tifa: But I didn't do anything...

Barret: Shit, I'll take it. So you can use that to look up what floor the research facility's on?

Tifa: I think so. Gimme a sec. Bingo. Professor Hojo's lab. 65th floor, looks like. Huh. Guess we can only get to the 59th floor via the elevators or stairs. To access any level above that, we need to check in at the Skyview Hall reception.

Cloud: 59th floor it is then.

Barret: Right. 

[They go into a back room with a huge vent and stairs.]

Barret: You have got to be shittin' me.

Cloud: Nope. We're a lot less likely to get caught this way.

Barret: But a lot more likely to die of boredom.

Cloud: It's only fifty-nine floors.

Tifa: Nothing to it.

Barret: Well, at least it ain't a race. Small blessing.

[The squad begins to walk the stairs, floor after floor.]

Tifa: Wonder what it's like up there.

Cloud: More security and restrictions. It's not gonna get any easier.

Barret: We're gonna be exhausted by the time we finally get to the top.

Cloud: Long as you pace yourself, you'll be fine.

Barret: Maybe we should take a quick break.

Tifa: C'mon, Barret.

Barret: You can stop if you want. Can even say it's for me.

Cloud: Just say you can't hack it.

Barret: I'll hack you, jackass!

Tifa: That's enough from both of you. Stupid arguments aren't going to get us there faster.

Cloud: But Tifa, I wasn't—

Tifa: Not now. Save it for the top!

[They go up and up...]

Barret: Hey, wait up. Guess these labs… and shit...are all the way at the very top?

Cloud: Yep. The very top.

Barret: That's… good to know…

Tifa: Cloud! Keep an eye on Barret!

Cloud: Copy.

Tifa: What was that? I don't think I heard you. Speak up!

Cloud: I'll keep an eye on Barret!

Barret: Thanks for the assist.

Cloud: Whatever.

Barret: I said...wait up!

Tifa: Hey, guys! Where are you?

Barret: Hey! Just a few floors behind you!

Tifa: Oh? You're sounding better!

Barret: Think I've got, like, a stairclimber's high!

Tifa: Glad to hear it!

Cloud: You tired?

Tifa: I was. But I'm feeling okay now.

Barret: Hahhh... Hahhh... Hahhh… Then what're we waitin' for!? Let's roll!

Tifa: You really are doing better

Barret: Hahhh... We...we gotta keep movin'...to keep movin'! Hahhh...

Tifa: Hard to argue with that. Let's go.

Barret: But tell me, these stairs...are these stairs ever gonna end!?

Tifa: I dunno! Ask the stairs!

Cloud: I don't think the stairs are talking.

Barret: Well, duh. I mean… duh.

Cloud: I was joking.

Tifa: That's enough from both of you.

Barret: Worst route ever. Gimme a suicidal last stand. At least—At least—that'd have an end!

Cloud: Let's shut up.

Tifa: Yes, let's.

Barret: Why?

Tifa: Because wishing for trouble might bring it.

Cloud: Yup. And you're in no state to fight anyway.

Barret: So...what should I do?

Cloud: Shut up and move.

[On the last floors, the squad is already slowly weaving on foot, very tired.]

Barret: This sucks! I wanna go back!

Tifa: You want to go down all those stairs you just climbed?

Barret: (singing) Another day, another struggle... Climbing stairs is so much trouble.

[Finally not getting to the fifty-ninth floor!]

Barret: Cloud, slow down!

Tifa: ...The end.

[The squad stands for a minute and tries to catch its breath.]

Barret: Made it.

Cloud: The real challenge starts now. Okay. Let's go.

[Meanwhile, in the B13 Materia Research Facility there are several balls of matter floating in a huge glass tube of liquid.]

Researcher: Seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred percent, one hundred ten… Mako supersaturation confirmed.

[Not far from them on a large leather chair sits a woman in a red dress. She has a fancy haircut, beautiful earrings, and a deep cleavage. She is laughing slyly. Her feet rest on the back of one of the soldiers, who clearly does not like this state of affairs.]

Researcher: Engaging materia cooling to reduce temperature.

Subordinate: Madam Director. You have a meeting shortly.

Scarlet: Stop. Your timing is impeccably atrocious.

Researcher: Mako density and materia integrity are both holding steady.

Researcher: Registering ass increase in core materia!

[The woman in the red dress is overwhelmed with excitement.]

Scarlet: Now. Show me something truly exquisite!

[Matter in the glass tube begins to multiply.]

Researcher: Contaminants registered!

[The woman in the red dress kicks the soldier who had her feet on him.]

Scarlet: We're leaving.

Researcher: Materia growth accelerating-outpacing models! Registering crystallization within the reserve tanks!

Rearcher: The reaction is out of control! We have to stop it quickly!

Scarlet: Clean up the mess, would you?

[She walks away, and the soldier crawls after her on all fours. We return to Cloud's squad.]

Barret: So this is the Skyview Hall, huh? Bet this place cost a fortune and then some.

Cloud: Let's look for reception.

Barret: Hey! Check it out.

Tifa: Come take a look, Cloud.

[They approach a giant window overlooking the city at night.]

Barret: Damn fools. Ones who come here at night to take in the view. So pretty and marvelous and beautiful! But every little light burning bright runs off her blood. And bit by bit they bleed her, never stoppin' to think how it'll end for them.

Tifa: Yeah.

Barret: Terrible, but beautiful all the same.

[They approach the reception desk, behind which there is a holographic receptionist.]

Receptionist: You must be here for our grand tour. Visitors have access to floors 60, 61, 62, as well as floor 63. You will proceed in that order. By the exit of each floor, you will find a device that will allow you to update the keycard in your possession… thereby allowing you to access the next floor. And now begins your grand tour. Please enjoy the Shinra experience!

Barret: Why's this whole thing gotta be such a big pain in the ass?

Tifa: I don't know about you, but this is kinda weird.

Cloud: You think everything's going too well?

Tifa: Yeah, I do. Think this is a trap?

Barret: Ha! If it is, then bring it on. Let's get this party started!

[Cloud and the others start pretending to be tourists.]

Barret: Man, why we gotta get all these damn keycards just to get anywhere?

Cloud: This is Shinra HQ. The hell did you expect?

Barret: Says the former company man himself. Guess you'd know about all the rules, regulations, and red tape—it's like coming home, huh?

[As the squad rides the escalator to the sixtieth floor we jump into the sixty-third floor to Reeve's office. He is talking on a giant smartphone.]

Reeve: Yes. Every reactor, every pillar. Like I said… a full inspection. There's no telling what kind of damage there might be. If you see anything—anything on all the ordinary, I want to know.

[His assistant enters the office with a stack of papers in her hands.]

Administrative Assistant: Sorry to bother you, sir…

Reeve: No, it's fine.

Administrative Assistant: I've brought the damage assessment for Sector 7 you requested. Sir… perhaps you should try and get some sleep.

Reeve: No, not yet. I need to finish preparing my draft of the reconstruction plan before tonight's board meeting. Whatever reasons they might've had, destroying an entire sector is… Whatever reasons they might've had, destroying an entire sector is… ...It's beyond the pale.

Administrative Assistant: Director… I would strongly advise you not to say such things outside of this room.

Reeve: Don't I know it…

[In the meantime, he is being watched closely by a surveillance camera... with a mustachioed, bald old man sitting behind the monitor. Meanwhile, our squad gets to the sixtieth floor and enters the memorial dedicated to the president of the company. In the center of the room stands a huge gold statue of the president.]

Guide: Welcome to the Shinra Building, our humble home!

Barret: Oh, hell no.

Guide: Here in the Memorial Museum… you can learn all about our president… as well as the various divisions that make up the company… and of course, the city of Midgar and the miracle of mako energy. Whatever takes your fancy, you're sure to learn something new!

Barret: Yeah, yeah. Shut up.

[The squad is examining the exhibition. Huge pictures of the president are arranged along the walls.]

Tifa: I think I just threw up a little.

Barret: Man thinks very highly of himself.

Guide: Hey, everybody! How's the grand tour? I hope you're all enjoying yourselves! Wasn't it fun to learn about Shinra and our esteemed president? And to get a peek at the president's mementos that was super cool! Now, moving along! The next exhibit will teach you about the important work we do here... by giving you a closer look at each of our divisions! I hope you're ready to be amazed, because you simply won't believe all the exciting adventures we have here!

[They notice some robots on display.]

Tifa: These all look so familiar.

Barret: 'Cause we've destroyed a bunch of 'em already.

Guide: The Advanced Weaponry exhibit is currently undergoing maintenance. We apologize for the inconvenience.

[The squad activates one of the holographic booths.]

Hojo: Uh, welcome to Shinra headquarters. My duties as director of Research and Development are, in all likelihood, far beyond your ability to comprehend. To there will be no presentation, as it would be a waste of my time and yours. But rest assured, we are making great strides. Albeit not at this particular moment, because I'm filming this rubbish instead. I believe I've wasted enough of my precious time as it is. Science waits for no one, after all. So—good day.

[The squad approaches the holographic Heidegger.]

Guide: The Public Security exhibit is currently undergoing maintenance. We apologize for the inconvenience.

[They approach the holographic Reeve.]

Reeve: Welcome to the Shinra Building. Our mission here at Urban Planning is to supply the residents of Midgar with energy created from mako. We also take pride in maintaining public infrastructure—the pillars and railways that run all throughout the city. Currently, we are working to construct an intra-plate expressway. When this project has been completed, it will provide much easier access to numerous locations all across Midgar. We appreciate your patience and understanding in the meantime.

Guide: Impressive, wasn't it? I hope you enjoyed learning about our divisions… and the wonderful ideas and solutions that are produced to benefit us all! Here at Shinra, we strive to ensure the safety of all residents around the clock! Now, moving along! The next exhibit will teach you all about the miracle of mako energy and our reactors… as well as the city of Midgar itself! So come on!

[The squad goes to another room.]

Guide: This is Midgar—our home recreated in 1/10000 scale. As you can see here… the eight mako reactors form a ring around the center of our city… and keep Midgar running day and night. The mako which flows beneath our feet is a truly limitless resource. At Shinra, we have developed technologies to extract it… and transform into the fuel and electricity that powers everything we do. Thanks to the miracle of mako energy our lives are - richer and better than ever before. Mako keeps our lights on at night, and made Midgar into the city that never sleeps. A triumph of technology and testament to man's potential.

Barret: Nothin' but a buncha lies!

Cloud: Except that mako has made people's lives better.

Barret: It's made people blind. Blind to the cold hard truth. Even I used to buy into their bullshit. Rememberin' that makes me even madder.

Guide: Congratulations! You can call yourself a proud Shinra scholar! Now, moving along! Next you'll learn about our progress in advanced science and technology. Please proceed to the 61st floor, the Visual Entertainment Hall.

Guide: Welcome to the Visual Entertainment Hall, where we showcase Shinra's cutting-edge technology… through an immersive visual and audio experience. Please relax and enjoy the show!

[The squad walks into a large auditorium.]

Barret: This place is empty.

[From the center of the room comes a metal pole that scans the squad with a green beam.]

Barret: The hell—?

[The platform on which they were standing soars into the air, and then completely disappears. The squad floats in the air observing the panorama of the planet earth, then begin to fly sharply on its surface.]

Guide: In the distant past, our planet was home to a people we call the Ancients. Many millennia before we discovered mako, these precursors were already pioneering its use. Somehow they learned of the great reservoir of energy pulsing beneath their feet. And once they had… the Ancients developed the means to harness this bountiful energy and bend it to their will. The fruits of their labors have survived to this very day in the form of certain kinds of materia. Their scripture, too, has endured: "We who are born of the planet, with her we speak. Her flesh we shape. Onto her promised land shall we one day return. By her loving grace and providence may we take our place in paradise." Alas, the Ancients themselves are long gone. Two thousand years ago, a meteor brought an end to their civilization. But before their fiery end, did the Ancients find their promised land? Even now, we have only to wonder. Times have changed—and the Shinra Electric Power Company is committed to changing and evolving with them. Like the Ancients, we have harnessed the power of mako. Are they out there, watching us? Waiting for us to join them in some blessed corner of the world—a green and verdant land where boundless mako energy will provide for our very need? Shinra is working for you, to fulfill the hope of the Ancients and lead us to that promised land. We shall not rest until our dream is realized.

[The virtual presentation ends.]

Barret: That it?

[Suddenly everything around it changes into a panorama of a crumbling city. The Shinra Corporation building towering above it collapses in powerful storms, and a hooded figure appears above it. The figure approaches Cloud, Barret and Tifa. The people around them flee. The approaching figure turns out to be Sephiroth. He quickly knocks Tifa and Barret out.]

Cloud: No!

[Tifa and Baret's bodies disappear. Sephiroth teleports behind Cloud, who only has time to say the following.]

Cloud: Sephiroth…

[The screen fades dramatically. We switch to a fat man drinking tea from an expensive mug and saucer. The fat man is on the 69th floor.]

Palmer: Oh dear, oh dear… A man of my refined tastes running out of butter! Shorn of its proper accompaniment, this tea… might as well be boiled pond water!

[A man walks by and the fat man drops his cup and saucer when he sees him.]

Palmer: No, it couldn't possibly have been…

[We're going back to our squad, which is fine.]

Barret: Crazy-ass thing made me wanna puke. And not just 'cause of the presentation, but the content too. Oughta come with a warning! That ain't for kids!

Cloud: That wasn't just a movie.

Tifa: That huge meteor... What was that about?

Barret: Like I said nothing you should show a kid.

Guide: Congratulations! You can call yourself a proud Shinra expert. Your mission is to go out and tell everyone about the wonders of Shinra! Next, you'll be visiting the repository for Shinra's expertise and know-how. Please make your way to the 62nd Floor, the Corporate Ar—

[The recording stutters and shuts down.]

Barret: What the!?

[The doors open and an elderly man in a white suit comes out to them.]

???: Greetings and welcome. Avalanche, I presume? 

[The elderly man bows.]

Hart: My name is Hart, and it's a pleasure to meet you. I've come to escort you to Mayor Domino, per his request.

Barret: The mayor of Midgar? The empty suit that's just a mouthpiece for Shinra?

Hart: Yes. The mayor of our dear Midgar… the most magnificent city ever built. That Mayor Domino. The Visual Entertainment Hall has been experiencing technical difficulties of late... and he suspected that these difficulties might impede your progress.

Cloud: So what does the mayor want with us?

Hart: I'm afraid you will have to ask him that yourself.

[He leaves.]

Barret: Guess we're supposed to follow.

[The squad goes up the escalator with Hart. They enter the vast library.]

Barret: Look at this place! So what you telling me the mayor's some kind of crazy bookworm?

Hart: Through here.

[He presses one of the books, opening a secret passage. Once in the secret part of the library, the squad follows Hart to the door.]

Barret: If this is a trap, you're a dead man, y'hear?

Hart: The mayor is waiting.

[Once in the room they find many monitors with surveillance cameras.]

Barret: This can't be right.

???: Wonderful! You finally made it.

[From behind the table stands the same bald old man with a beard who was watching them.]

Domino: I am the mayor of the great metropolis of mako. Domino, at your service. I must say, you three haven't exactly been discreet. I wonder who's been cleaning up all your messes.

Cloud: What the hell's going on?

Domino: Come on. Think about it. You've been caught by security several times… walked in front of every other camera… and scared an accountant half to death. Do you hear the alarm? No? You're welcome. I can only assume your cell wasn't looped in. I am Avalanche's man on the inside.

Barret: Say what?

Domino: Is it really that surprising to you? You've seen where they put me. The mayor of the greatest city in the whole wide world… tucked away in a secret broom closet in the damned archives! The nerve. Those stupid Shinra pricks thought I'd just shut up and accept their treatment, but they were wrong! Dead wrong!

Barret: Well, this oughta make things easier.

Tifa: We need to break into Popfessor Hojo's lab.

Domino: What? Why? You mean you're not here to give President Shinra his comeuppance?

Cloud: We're here to save a friend who was taken.

Barret: But the president's gonna get his too if I have anything to say about it.

Domino: Well, I don't particularly care what you end up doing—so long as it hurts Shinra…

Barret: Great.

Domino: I can get you as far as the 64th floor.

Barret: Hold up. You telling me that that's the best you can do?

Domino: That is indeed the best that I can do.

Cloud: But you're the mayor.

Domino: "But you're the mayor"? Does this look like the office of a mayor? I'm a glorified librarian—nothing more! They don't even invite me to their meetings! Sorting records and reports that's all I do! My hands and fingers have more paper cuts than skin! No one knows my pain—my daily torment! They've made me a pathetic shell of a man.

Barret: Okay! They did you wrong, like us but we'll make it right. So just calm down. Deep breaths, man. Deep breaths.

Domino: Let me see that keycard of yours. Here you are. You can now use it to access the Recreational Facility on the 63rd floor.

Barret: And then what are we supposed to do?

Domino: You look for Below Avalanche collaborator. Identify yourselves and he'll give you a keycard to the 64th. The countersign is… "The mayor is the best!" "Midgar's mayor is nothing less!" "Everyone says he's cooler than the rest!" Just say "mayor" to the guy, and if he goes "the best!" with gusto, then you've found your man. You got it?

Hart: If you require additional assistance, please do not hesitate to ask.

Cloud: So, can you tell us anything about this collaborator?

Hart: Certainly, I could do just that. But a man in my position must conduct his affairs with discretion. Which is to say that that which has been requested cannot be freely given… if you take my meaning.

Barret: You want money!

Hart: Disclosing confidential information entails considerable risk. Due compensation is to be expected. In this particular instance that would amount to ten thousand gil.

Barret: Rip us off more, why don'tcha?

[Cloud hands him 10,000.]

Hart: The 64th floor is reserved for our executives. The individual you seek is fastidious and well-dressed. This individual likes to visit the 63rd floor to decompress from the stress of the job.

Barret: That really all you got for us?

Hart: Oh, are you dissatisfied with your purchase? How unfortunate. Perhaps this will help preserve our relationship.

[He gives Barret a machine gun.]

Barret: Huh?

Hart: An expression of my gratitude and appreciation.

Barret: That's better.

Hart: Before you ask, all purchases are nonrefundable. The information I provided concerned an executive, after all. You will know them by their carefully cultivated appearance.

Tifa: I still can't believe the mayor is working with Avalanche.

Barret: Would've been nice to know. Idiots at HQ shoulda kept us in the loop.

[It's me going up to the sixty-third floor, and in the meantime we switch to the office of Dr. Hojo, who is interrogating Aerith.]

Hojo: So. About this precious promised land of yours… Come now, Aerith. You misunderstand my intentions. I wish only to satisfy their material greed so I can be left to pursue my great work. Our great work, my dear.

[Aerith remains silent.]

Hojo: You're the spitting image of her now. I regret it to this day. If she had only trusted me instead of trying to run, it could have played out quite differently. What a terrible tragedy, to lose the last of the pure blooded Ancients… though not completely. Would you like to see your mother? Albeit through the lens of one of my microscopes. Did you really think we'd leave such a precious specimen to rot in the gutter? We collected and catalogued every last bit of her. Hair, skin, organs, every fragment of every bone… As breathtaking in death as in life! As you, my dear! Ifalna was elegance, right down to her cellular structure. And there it is. That same elegance.

[A beeping sound comes from his devices.]

Hojo: Oh—yes. Time for yet another meeting. Sit tight. I won't be long.

[He walks out of his office. Aerith exhales and removes his mask of steely confidence. We return to our squad.]

Barret: Here's the 63rd floor, where loyal Shinra employees relax and recharge!

Tifa: It's pretty late, but I bet people are still here dealing with the aftermath of Sector 7.

Barret: It's their own damn fault.

Cloud: Stay focused. We need to find this guy.

Barret: Yeah, yeah. Guess I better get working on my conversation skills.

[The squad takes the elevator up to the office space where a lot of people are actively working - some running around with documents, some grabbing their heads, and some sleeping from fatigue right on the keyboard.]

Tifa: They look busy.

Cloud: A plate did just fall.

Tifa: Seeing them like this somehow makes me feel a little bit better.

Cloud: Let's find our contact.

Barret: Not seeing any security around. One less thing to worry about.

[They walk through the rooms and go into one with a huge tree in the center housed in a cylindrical glass greenhouse. This is the cafeteria.]

Barret: Where are you… mister collaborator...

Tifa: I think we just need to start talking to people who look the part.

Barret: Remember, say "mayor."

Tifa: If they say “the best,” then we have a winner.

[They approach a large television set on the far side of the room. The newscasts are followed by several staff members standing by the TV.]

Host: Today we welcome a special guest: Shinra's Director of Public Security… who has an important message to share with us.

Heidegger: Everyone here at Shinra is deeply saddened and outraged by this unconscionable act of terrorism. But at the same time, we will not be cowed by threats or violence. To the people of Midgar, I make this vow: we will find the villains responsible and bring them to justice. Are you listening, Avalanche—you cowardly dogs!? Run all you like. Shinra is coming.

[Cloud walks up to the first employee he comes across, eating his lunch peacefully at his desk.]

Shinra Employee: Hm? Are you military? Cool, cool. I guess things have been keeping you pretty busy around here. Have you found the guys who did this yet?

Cloud: The mayor.

Shinra Employee: Huh? Uhh… what about the mayor?

Cloud: Never mind.

[He approaches another employee.]

Shinra Employee: Please, just leave me alone.

Cloud: The mayor.

[And another one.]

Shinra Employee: No, I'm gonna be here a while longer.

Cloud: The mayor.

Shinra Employee: Hey, shhh! I'm on the phone!

[The squad goes up to the second floor and finds a domed structure with a staff member standing next to it.]

Barret: The hell's that?

Cloud: Combat sim. You can use it to train for battle in a virtual space.

Barret: Does training in that thing really make you better?

[They approach the employee.]

Shinra Employee: You work here? I don't recognize you. Can I help you with something?

Cloud: The mayor.

Collaborator: ...Is the best! I was told to expect you. Need access to upper floors, right?

Barret: That's right.

Collaborator: Before I trust you with this keycard, I need to see what you can actually do.

Barret: Say what?

Collaborator: Do you know what would happen if you got caught? We're putting our lives on the line here. Prove you're worth it. We have a state-of-the-art combat simulator. It can provide a real challenge, let me tell you. If you beat the sim, then the keycard is all yours. Well, well. You gonna call it quits?

[Cloud enters the simulation with the others. After defeating Shinra's virtual reality robots, they return to the employee.]

Collaborator: All right, I've seen enough. I'm a man of my word. Here. This keycard will grant you access to the 64th floor. You can use the elevator to get there. Once you're up there, just what is it you plan on doing?

Cloud: We came to get one of our friends. She's being held in a research lab somewhere.

Collaborator: A lab? Then she must be with Professor Hojo. It won't be easy to get to her. Access to R&D is limited to authorized personnel only.

Cloud: We'll find a way in. Know where we can find Hojo?

Collaborator: A board meeting is scheduled to start soon. It's being held in the main conference room. President Shinra, Professor Hojo, and the other directors will be in attendance.

Barret: Think they like surprises? We can even take the president as a hostage. Think of the leverage!

Collaborator: Try it, and security will be on your asses in seconds.

Cloud: We need to find out what they're planning.

Collaborator: So you want to spy on their meeting? Hmm, I have an idea. Head to the men's restroom. You can climb into the air ducts there. They go all the way to the conference room.

Cloud: Thanks for the tip.

[As the squad descends to the first floor, Cloud encounters two security guards who suddenly recognize him.]

Security Officer: Cloud? You're Cloud, right?

Security Officer: Holy shit!

Security Officer: It's cool, bro. We went through training together. Damn! So you still alive and kicking, huh? Some of the guys heard you got smoked, but I told ‘em it was all bullshit!

[Meanwhile, Cloud is getting headaches again. Memories bring him suffering.]

Security Officer: Hey sit tight man—I'mma go get Kunsel. I'll be right back.

[They leave.]

Barret: Old buddy?

Tifa: You okay?

Cloud: Yeah.

Tifa: But you were just—

Cloud: I'm good. Let's keep moving.

[They walk to the escalators and meet the president along the way, along with Heidegger and several guards.]

President Shinra: I trust the narrative is intact?

Heidegger: Rock solid. The people have embraced the Wutai-Avalanche conspiracy wholeheartedly. I've almost come to believe it myself.

President Shinra: Wutai's response?

Heidegger: So far, nothing. And if those cowards do react, all the better for us and our story.

President Shinra: Then we shall stay the course.

Heidegger: If I may, sir, there was one other matter.

President Shinra: Oh?

Heidegger: A message from our man Palmer.

Barret: Dammit!

Tifa: Barret.

Barret: Yeah, yeah, I know. We came here to save Aerith. That's our first priority.

Cloud: That's right. We only get one chance. Hojo should be at board meeting, so that'll buy us some time. We need to plan this just right.

Tifa: Do you think that's where Professor Hojo is?

Cloud: Where he should be.

Tifa: What's the plan?

Cloud: Little bit of recon. Need to find a way to infiltrate that room.

Barret: You hear the words comin' out of your mouth? We just gotta find that bathroom so we can get into the air duct. Ask anyone here. They can point us in the right direction.

Cloud: No, thanks. We can find it on our own.

[They look around and find the restroom. The men's restroom.]

Tifa: All right, I'll wait out here.

Barret: Huh? You can't hang out here.

Cloud: Tifa. It'd be better if you waited inside.

Tifa: Maybe, but this is… Oh… never mind, you're right. Oh, thank god. No one's in here.

Barret: Love to show them what the ones down below look like.

Tifa: Come on, let's just find that duct.

[Cloud finds the air vent grille.]

Cloud: Gotcha.

[Barret understands that with his size there is no way he can get in there.]

Barret: Look, I'm...

Cloud: On guard duty.

Barret: Right.

Tifa: So… can I go with you? Don't wanna be here any longer than I have to.

Cloud: Yeah, sure. Just follow behind.

[They climb into the vent and crawl through it eavesdropping on employee conversations.]

Shinra Employee: I'm sure they're safe.

Woman Shinra Employee: (crying) But we live right by Sector 7 and I keep calling and calling, but I still can't get through.

Shinra Employee: I heard that all the phone lines are down. It doesn't mean anything.

Woman Shinra Employee: (crying) ...You sure?

Shinra Employee: Pretty sure…

Shinra Employee 2: Depending on the board's decision, we may start two projects simultaneously: rebuilding the plate and the city. Members of the Urban Planning Division will likely take point on both. Director Tuesti has ordered teams to come up with three-, five-, and ten-year plans. We're going to have to put a lot of man-hours into this, so we'll need to start ASAP. Does anyone have any questions at all?

[Finally, they find a vent that leads out into the office where the president hold a meeting.]

Cloud: This it?

Palmer: I'm telling you, I saw him! With my own eyes! Sauntering down the corridor!

Heidegger: We don't have time for this nonsense!

Palmer: He was as close to me as you are now! The shock of it made me spill my tea!

Heidegger: (hits the table) Enough already! If there are intruders in the building, my men will deal with them.

Palmer: But Mister President! Sir! I swear to you—

President Shinra: Reeve.

Reeve: Sir. I have the damage assessment for Sector 7, and I'm afraid the figures are catastrophic—

President Shinra: Spare us the doom and gloom. Was there anything else?

Reeve: Well sir, I've also drafted a reconstruction plan—

President Shinra: That will not be needed. Not with the Ancient in our custody once more.

Reeve: Uh… with respect, sir, I don't see how—

Scarlet: Two words, Reeve: "Neo Midgar."

President Shinra: In their promised land… we will build a new mako-powered metropolis.

Reeve: Mister President! We still don't know for sure that the promised land even—

[The president raises his hand.]

President Shinra: Professor Hojo.

Hojo: The test results were within expectations. The specimen is somewhat lacking compared to her pure-blood mother, but for our purposes she should more than suffice.

President Shinra: So, she can lead us to the promised land?

Hojo: Well, Mister Presidentthat remains to be seen. I would like your permission to secure her cooperation through more "forceful" means. Forceful yet gentle. She is a precious resource that must be handled with care.

Scarlet: Personally, I've never had a problem with torture.

Heidegger: My armory is at your disposal, should you require anything.

Нојo: I… had something more psychological in mind. Better to scar the psyche than mar the flesh.

[Palmer laughs covering his mouth.]

President Shinra: Proceed as you see fit. However. You will not make the same mistake twice. Is that clear?

Hojo: If I may, Mister President, I have an idea how we might mitigate the risks. Simply put, we could have the Ancient reproduce. In the absence of a second specimen, we would need to identify an alternative mate. I would start with candidates from SOLDIER. These would of course include S and G types. Quite frankly, there's no telling what kind of properties a crossbred specimen might possess. So—What say you all?

[Scarlet and Heidegger mutter something, either in disgust or in thought. The president rises from his chair.]

President Shinra: If there is nothing else.

Reeve: Mister President!

President Shinra: Meeting adjourned.

Reeve: Please, sir!

Hojo: Something stinks.

[Cloud and Tifa go back to the restroom.]

Barret: Anything?

Cloud: The man in the lab coat. Head of R&D. We follow him.

Barret: Okay. And then we kill the son of a bitch.

Cloud: Not until he's led us to Aerith. That's the plan.

[They leave the restroom and walk down the halls until they find Hojo going to his lab.]

Hojo: Walking the halls of this very building, who would have believed it. I wonder… were I to arrange a face-to-fat… How I should like to meet their offspring. Ah, hit that can wait. First, we must have answers. Ahh, but that can wait. First, we must have answers. A simple psychoactive agent should suffice. Nothing likely to cause any long-term damage.

[The squad follows him.]

Cloud: Let's go.

Barret: Right.

[After catching up with the crazy professor, Barret comes out of hiding and presents his machine gun to his head.]

Barret: Don't move! I ain't bluffing.

Hojo: What is this?

Barret: A dozen bullets in your head, unless you open that door right now.

[Hojo opens the door of her laboratory on the sixty-fifth floor. It turns out to be a huge base.]

Hojo: You must be the ones who've been stirring up trouble lately. The eco-terrorists? If so I can't imagine what business you have with me. The president's upstairs. Go on, shoo.

Barret: Shut up. Keep walking. None of y'all better move a muscle!

Hojo: Do stop pushing. Unlike you, I am less accustomed to physical violence.

Barret: You'll get used to it.

Hojo: What is it that you want?

Barret: Our friend. She's in your lab.

Hojo: Really?

Barret: Tell us where Aerith is!

Hojo: Oh, so she's your friend… Well well well, in that case.. Yes... That might do the trick.

Barret: Mind speaking up some?

Hojo: It's nothing. Just imagining how she might react if I were to present to her your fresh corpses.

[The squad is surrounded by spherical robots and the professor himself walks away laughing. He pushes a few buttons on the panel.]

Hojo: I promise… you will regret this.

[The professor rides the elevator while a massive gate opens at the far end of the room and a giant mutant, H0512, emerges. The squad is forced into battle. Not without difficulty they defeat the giant.]

Barret: Hey! Hojo's gettin' away!

[They rush out in pursuit of the crazy professor. Meanwhile, in one of the glass containers, a certain lion-like creature is induced... the squad rides the elevator to the sixty-sixth floor, reaching the main level of the laboratory.]

Cloud: Aerith!

[He sees Aerith behind the energy shield. Hojo himself is on the second floor in the control room, talking to the squad through loudspeakers.]

Hojo: Very impressive. I really must thank you for providing me such invaluable combat data.

Barret: Cocky little egghead, ain'tcha. The results provided by my predictive models...

Hojo: The results provided by my predictive models, indicate that this force should be more than capable of handling you.

Barret: Y'all 'bout to learn predictable.

Cloud: We're taking Aerith back!

Hojo: Oh? "Take her back" you say? Correct me if I am wrong, but did the girl not come here of her own free will? Or do you mean to tell me that she is your personal property?

Barret: She only came here to save Marlene!

Hojo: I'm afraid you misunderstand. 

[Several soldiers enter the lab.]

Hojo: But I really can't be bothered to explain. This facility is home to extraordinary specimens that will change the world as we know it. Do try to be considerate.

[The squad quickly defeats the soldiers.]

Barret: Looks like your models got it wrong.

Hojo: Yes… an unknown variable, perhaps. Well, no matter. Reinforcements will soon arrive.

Cloud: But will they get here in time to save you from me?

Hojo: My, are you a SOLDIER?

Cloud: Yeah.

Hojo: No, not quite. Oh, now I recall. My memory was mistaken. My boy, you weren't a SOLDIER...

[Cloud gets a headache again. Suddenly several ghosts in black robes appear and attack the crazy professor.]

Hojo: What!? What is this—fascinating phenomenon!? What's happening!? Where are you taking me!?

Barret: What are those things up to this time?

Aerith: Cloud!

Cloud: Barret!

Barret: Got it. Stand back!

[He destroys the lock by shooting it with a machine gun. For some reason the lock in the cage with the lion-like creature also breaks and opens.]

Aerith: You care for me.

Cloud: Yep.

Tifa: You good?

Aerith: I'm great!

Barret: Thanks for saving Marlene. I owe you one.

Cloud: Save it for later!

[Two robots with lightsabers appear.]

Tifa: Aerith! You okay?

Aerith: Thank you.

Tifa: No biggie.

Cloud: Let's get outta here.

[The lion-like creature jumps onto the floor bouncing off the walls and gets in the way of the heroes. After growling at them, it runs away by jumping out the window.]

Barret: The hell was that thing?

Aerith: We need to go!

Tifa: Aerith!

Barret: What the—!?

Cloud: Come on.

[The lion-like creature finds the crazy professor who somehow has escaped from the ghosts and runs to him, but the professor manages to hide behind the elevator doors. The lion-like creature hits the closed doors. Turning around, it encounters our squad.]

Barret: What? You wanna go?

Aerith: Stop. This child's a friend.

[She slowly walks up to the creature and puts her hand on its head.]

Barret: Uhh... So what the hell is it?

???: A fascinating question.

Tifa: Did it just talk?

???: You asked what "it" is. Hmm… I am that which you see before you. Nothing more. I'd appreciate it if we simply left it at that. Agreed?

Tifa: Thirteen?

Red XIII: "Red XIII." The designation given to me by Hojo.

Tifa: Then… you must have another name. What is it?

[Red doesn't answer, but just turns his head toward the elevator that's gone.]

Cloud: He got away.

Barret: So, we gonna go get the son of a bitch?

[The Cloud's head begins to ache again, so much so that he even hallucinates. He slowly walks toward the elevator, imagining that it is a giant container with a human-shaped creature with many tubes connected to it.]

Cloud: Je...no… Oh... Ah… Mo… ther…

[He touches the elevator and faints.]

Tifa & Aerith: Cloud!

[The scene changes to the basement floor of B3. Tseng, Reno and Rude are sitting in the office. Tseng works with the papers and the others just sit there.]

Tseng: You know, Reno. I think you might be due for some R&R.

Reno: Nah, I'm good…

Rude: What are we going to do about Sector 7?

Tseng: “We” are going to do nothing.

Rude: Been thinking. Was all that necessary?

Tseng: Had we refused, someone else would've completed the task. We have spared that someone the burden of a guilty conscience. Perhaps that will ease yours.

Reno: Yeah… nope.

Tseng: Let's try another tack then. They were a sacrifice to balance the scales.

Reno: Say what?

Tseng: After everything we've taken from the planet, we were due to give something back.

Rude: Do you actually believe that?

Tseng: Does it matter?

[The phone on his desk starts ringing.]

Tseng: Yes. Understood. The VIP needs us.

Chapter 17: Deliverance from Chaos
[Cloud comes to his senses.]

Tifa: Cloud.

Aerith: Oh, thank goodness. You're awake.

Tifa: You okay?

Cloud: Yeah. Where are we?

Aerith: Where I lived—when I was still a child.

Tifa: Are you okay? Maybe you should rest a little longer. I don't want you to push yourself. We're all worried.

Aerith: My mom and I stayed here, years ago when I was just a little girl. The room...looks exactly the same. Every morning, they'd come and take my mom away. I remember crying here alone.

Cloud: …Aerith. Before we break outta here, talk to us. There's so much we don't know.

[Aerith ponders for a few minutes.]

Aerith: I'm… a descendent of the Ancients. That's pretty much it really. Oh but just so you know that's not their actual name. They called themselves… the Cetra.

Barret: “We who are born of the planet, with her we speak. Her flesh we shape. Unto her promised land shall we one day return. By her loving grace and providence may we take our place in paradise.”

Aerith: You know it!

Barret: Yeah, well... Honestly I thought that part was just a fairy tale.

Aerith: Shinra thinks it's true. They've been searching for the promised land for a long time.

Tifa: And they must think you can lead them to it... Can you?

Aerith: Nope. Someday, maybe, I'll find it in me. But now? Not even if I wanted to.

Barret: Even if you could, that land belongs to the—I mean... To you and your people. Shinra's after it because they believe it's rich in mako—mako they’ve got no right to claim. But they'll try to take it anyway, won't they? Greedy bastards'll never stop. Okay… New plan. Y'all take Aerith and get the hell outta here. Me, I'mma go bust some Shinra heads.

Aerith: Barret, wait... You can't do that...

[Several ghosts in black robes fly into the room.]

Barret: Oh, great. These assholes again! Probably some Shinra science experiment.

Red XIII: Whispers. Perhaps best described as arbiters of fate. They are drawn to those who attempt to alter destiny’s course and ensure they do not.

Tifa: Like capital D... "Destiny"?

Red XIII: The flow of the great river that is the planet, from inception to oblivion.

Tifa: And you're saying that that flow is somehow… fixed?

Red XIII: Yes. For it is the will of the planet itself.

Barret: So if we're destined for a bleak future, these Whispers will try to keep us on that course? Now wait just a damn minute! How in the hell can you possibly know any of that? Spouting that cryptic stuff—which could all be bullshit! I mean, ain't you a Shinra lab rat—dog?

[Red looks tiredly at Barret.]

Red XIII: I'm not a rat dog. When Aerith reached out to me… I found this knowledge of the Whispers.

[Whispers begin to fly around Aerith.]

Aerith: Listen to me! Please...

Cloud: Aerith.

Aerith: The Shinra Electric Power Company isn't the real enemy. It started with them, sure… but I promise you… there's a much bigger threat. I just want to do everything in my power to help. All of you… And the planet.

Tifa: Aerith. What are you not telling us?

Aerith: I'm lost in a maze, and… every step is taking me further from the path… Every time the Whispers touch me… I lose something. A part of myself. “Follow them. The yellow flowers.”

[Tifa pulls Aerith out of the whirlwind that the Whispers set up.]

Tifa: It's okay. We'll find a way out together.

Aerith: Okay.

Barret: Weird…

[Two TVs on the wall are switched on. A bald mayor appears on the screen.]

Domino: Ah-ha! There you are! What are you doing, man!?

[Someone particularly fat takes the camera away from him.]

Wedge: Hey guys! Long time no see!

Barret: Wedge!?

Tifa: You're here!?

Barret: Y-you shouldn't be up and moving!

Wedge: I'm feeling much better thanks to Elmyra's cooking! Ah, but that's not what I wanted to talk to you about! Listen—any moment now—

[There is a strong earthquake.]

Tifa: What was that? An explosion?

Wedge: HQ's running the show this time. They're raising hell to try and flush out the president.

Domino: This complicates matters. That explosion just now put the whole building on high alert.

Tifa: So now we're trapped in here?

Domino: No need to panic, little lady. See? You can still move freely within Hojo's laboratory.

Wedge: Find a way to the roof. An Avalanche chopper will come to extract you. 

Barret: HQ's bailing us out? I doubt it. Not after all the shit we've pulled.

Wedge: I asked them really nicely! Like, super-duper nicely!

Tifa: Thanks, Wedge.

Wedge: Just get to the roof, okay?

[After the camera turns off Wedge grabs his stomach - his wounds are still raw.]

Barret: I didn't ask him to do any of that.

Cloud: Yeah, well, I'm glad he did.

Barret: Huh? I'mma still chew him out for it later. Anyway, we gotta get to the roof, right?

Red XIII: Then we can use the same elevator that Hojo did.

Barret: That elevator. Was it this way?

Red XIII: Yes. His odor still lingers.

[They go up in an elevator.]

Barret: What happened here?

Aerith: The little ones in the pods. Where did they go?

Red XIII: It stinks in here. Back there.

Barret: Now what do we do?

[The road is blocked by debris and Barret tries to move it. At that moment they are attacked by several creatures from the Black Lagoon that the squad has fought before.]

Cloud: Someone's picking a fight.

Barret: So go give 'em one already!

Cloud: Way ahead of you!

[He engages and defeats the creatures, while Barret, along with Red, tosses the debris aside to clear the passage.]

Barret: Nice job!

[He holds out his hand, not realizing that Red has nothing to shake it with. Red looks at him again with a tired look.]

Barret: What?

[Red turns around and slaps him on the arm with his tail. He walks away.]

Barret: Shit—what the hell Red!?

[The answer continues to explore the giant laboratory. They get on the elevator.]

Cloud: Let's go.

Tifa: Right.

[As the elevator doors close, Cloud notices a small black feather flying through the air and falling to the floor. The feather seems vaguely familiar to Cloud, but the closed elevator door leaves no time for reflection. The squad ascends to the sixty-eighth floor, the closed part of the laboratory.]

Barret: Hell is this place?

Red XIII: Hojo's treasure. Shinra's dark secret.

[In the distance you can see huge cameras with tubes connected to them. The mechanisms look ominous.]

Barret: What I wouldn't give to burn it all down… but we need to get to the roof.

[After walking a few meters, Cloud and the others find a huge capsule with a humanoid creature inside. Above the creature is the inscription "Jenova".]

Barret: What is that...?

Aerith: Jenova.

[Cloud is overcome by headaches again. He sees Sephiroth descend from the sky and approach Jenova.]

Sephiroth: Mother... Together we will reclaim our world.

[Then he sees little Tifa in a cowboy hat leaning over the body of some man.]

Tifa: I'm sick of this! I'm sick of all of this!

[She picks up the katana lying on the floor and goes somewhere for revenge. Meanwhile, Tifa approaches Cloud.]

Tifa: Cloud?

[Sephiroth, meanwhile, turns to Cloud, who slowly begins to walk toward him.]

Cloud: Tell me. Is it really you?

[Cloud's headaches are getting worse.]

Sephiroth: Don't deny me. Embrace me.

[Screaming fearfully, he draws his sword and runs toward him.]

Aerith: Cloud!

[Sephiroth swings his sword to cut the bridge they are standing on, but Cloud jumps and attacks him anyway. He finds himself cut off by his comrades.]

Sephiroth: A touching reunion.

[Hojo was watching them the whole time through a surveillance camera.]

Hojo: Very, very good! And thus is the hypothesis proven correct! I can only hope you will continue not to disappoint.

[Meanwhile, Cloud comes to his senses rising from the pile of rubble.]

Cloud: I'd better hurry.

[He presses the lever to remove the pods from the wall and get to the other side.]

Cloud: Test subject pods? Guess I can use these.

[Soon Cloud runs into two creatures from the Black Lagoon. Suddenly Red appears who, with his feline agility, was able to reach him.]

Red XIII: Need a hand?

Cloud: Thanks.

[Red helps him in the battle. Together they defeat the creatures.]

Cloud: Yeah. Where're the others?

Red XIII: Nowhere close.

Cloud: Let's go.

[Together they find a few more pods, but the switch that removes them is on the other side.]

Red XIII: What is it?

Cloud: If we flip that switch, we can get to the other side.

Red XIII: Hm. I may be able to do that.

Cloud: You sure?

Red XIII: Yes.

[He runs up the wall and switches the lever with his mouth.]

Red XIII: Will this do the trick?

[They run further down the faintly lit corridors and soon hear a familiar voice.]

Barret: What kind of freak show have they got going on in here? Stay back!

[He fights several small robots.]

Cloud: Need a hand?

Barret: Yeah, right! Just having a little bit of fun with them, that's all.

Cloud: For how long?

Barret: Long as it took you to get here!

[After defeating small robots, a larger robot appears.]

Barret: Shit, it's like they're churning out monsters here.

Red XIII: That's not far from the truth…

[The robots are defeated.]

Barret: Hey... You okay?

Cloud: Yeah. I'm fine...

Barret: If you say so.

Cloud: Guess we're out.

Red XIII: What's the plan?

Barret: First, we find Tifa and Aerith. Then we head for the roof. Should be an elevator somewhere. Didn't expect any of this, but we just gotta roll with it. Come on, let's go.

Red XIII: Hm. The door seems to have locked. No going back.

[Barret sees Red XIII running agilely up the wall.]

Barret: All right. Now you're starting to impress me.

[Several creatures from the Black Lagoon attack them, but several small capsules suddenly drop on them. Tifa and Aerith drop them from the second floor.]

Aerith: We got 'em!

Barret: Yeah! Keep it up, y'all!

Aerith: Don't move an inch! We'll head down too. Be right there!

[Trying to get to the rest of the girls are behind the energy barrier.]

Barret: Huh? I can't hear what you're saying!

Red XIII: I think there's something over there.

[Cloud uses the intercom to talk to the girls.]

Tifa: Hello? Cloud? Can you hear me?

Cloud: Yeah. You okay in there?

Tifa: No need to worry. We're fine, but what do we do now? I don't see any way out of this room.

[Suddenly a voice comes out of the speakers.]

Hojo: Ahem. Can you all hear me?

Red XIII: Hojo…

Hojo: (laughs) So tell me. How are you finding the Drum? You know it's filled with the most advanced technology in Midgar, if not the entire world. You should feel honored to see it firsthand! You'll also have the opportunity to take part in a rather ambitious experiment of mine.

Barret: What!?

Hojo: When all the pieces are in place, I will open the door to the 3rd ward. Perhaps you can help me with the necessary preparations? Given that you're already in the perfect position to do so. I look forward to data both invaluable and instrumental.

Barret: "Necessary preparations"? What the hell is this asshole talking about?

Tifa: Can't we just ignore him and keep going?

Red XIII: I'm afraid not. If I know Hojo, he won't let us out until we indulge his request for data.

Tifa: He said something about a ward, right? I'm pretty sure I saw a door to one upstairs somewhere.

Aerith: So… you wanna check it out?

[Cloud agrees and lets the girls go.]

Cloud: You two'll be on your own. Be careful.

Tifa: Thanks. We will.

Barret: We'll be waiting right here. If anything happens—anything at all—you call us. All right?

Aerith: Roger that!

[The control is switched to Tifa.]

Tifa: Hey, you think Cloud's doing okay? He's been acting really weird lately more than usual.

Aerith: True, but it's Cloud—I'm sure he'll be fine. But what about you, Tifa? How are you holding up?

Tifa: Huh? Oh I'm fine! I guess this has to be the 3rd ward, right?

Aerith: Think so. But it looks like the door's locked.

Tifa: There has to be something we can do. Let's look around.

Aerith: Gotcha.

[The girls find another intercom.]

Tifa: Cloud, can you hear me? We found the door to that ward he was talking about, but it's locked and we can't get it open.

Cloud: All right.

Aerith: About those preparations Hojo mentioned before… I think we're supposed to do something with that.

Red XIII: The central terminal. Interesting.

[Control reverts back to Cloud's squad.]

Red XIII: Off I go. There's no control panel. We don't have the means to go this way.

[They open the passage and control is switched back to the girls.]

Aerith: Look! Now they can get across too.

Tifa: We should let Cloud know.

[Back to Cloud.]

Cloud: All right. We'll make our way to the central terminal. Sit tight until you hear from us.

Barret: The hell kind of "research" is this?

Red XIII: The cataclysm that came from the stars—Jenova. Hojo has devoted half of his life to her study.

Barret: I don't give a shit about any of that.

Red XIII: The experiments in this facility… involve the enhancement of life-forms and machines through the application… of Jenova biological data. Hojo's plan is to pit his subjects against us, thereby facilitating their growth.

Barret: Hmph! So this asshole thinks he can treat us like his experiments.

Red XIII: I know what fate awaits these creations. Let us put them out of their misery. We must first find a passage that leads to the center. Now it's my turn. There's no control panel. We don't have the means to go this way.

Barret: Wait a sec. Weren't the girls right hy the door to the 3rd ward?

Red XIII: There are four switches. One for each ward.

[Control returns to the girls. They do their part and turn control over to Cloud.]

Announcement: Transfusion procedure complete. Commencing test of augmented research specimen.

Red XIII: You need to warn the others. Tell them to be careful. Very careful.

Cloud: Tifa, you there? We accessed the central terminal. The door should be unlocked now. Any one of Hojo's twisted creations could be in that ward. Be careful.

Tifa: We will. See you in a bit.

[Control returns to the girls. They explore the base for a long time, fighting various creatures and robots, and then enter a small warehouse full of empty cells.]

Tifa: Uh, what is this place for?

Aerith: There's a... sadness…

[Entering a small warehouse from the second floor, the girls notice a system of pipes running above it.]

Aerith: Look.

Tifa: Let's get across with those.

[Eventually the pipe breaks and they fall to the first floor where two bloodthirsty monsters are waiting for them.]

Aerith: That hurt. Did we wake 'em up?

Tifa: Yeah, looks like it.

[The girls defeat the monsters and come out to a huge brazier in the center of which is placed a colossal cistern with a top system above it.]

Tifa: Is this really the exit?

[The door behind them closes.]

Aerith: I hate that man. I really do.

[Eventually they find a lever and switch it to raise the bridge.]

Tifa: You think now the others can get across too?

[She calls Cloud with an intercom.]

Tifa: Hey, Cloud?

Cloud: Tifa?

Tifa: We used the control panel here a little while ago, so you should be able to get to the other side. Can you check?

Barret: Roger that. Was gettin' pretty bored anyway.

[Control returns to Cloud.]

Cloud: You two, stay there. We'll call if anything comes up.

Aerith: Okay. Be careful.

Announcement: Transfusion procedure complete. Commencing test of augmented research specimen.

Red XIII: It stinks.

Cloud: More of Hojo's experiments.

Announcement: Commencing test. All personnel must evacuate area.

[Cloud's squad arrives at the control room where the crazy professor is lodged. They defeat several monsters there.]

Hojo: I hope you're enjoying your experience.

Barret: Why don'tcha come down here and ask me?

[He shoots at the glass.]

Hojo: Before you get any ideas, you should know this glass is bulletproof. No discernible changes after contact. Most fascinating. Hmm…

[He leaves.]

Barret: Hey! We ain't done yet!

Red XIII: It seems we have no choice.

Announcement: Commencing test. All personnel must evacuate area. Commencing test.

Barret: How'd ya like watchin' your precious toys get torn to shreds!?

[The squad defeats another robot.]

Hojo: I never grow tired of watching my toys be broken, no matter how many times I've seen it happen. Such is the case when you truly enjoy your work. Now, for the next step…

[Barret sees Hojo again in the control room window.]

Barret: Look! Now's our chance to kill the bastard! Time for you to pay the piper!

[He opens fire.]

Hojo: Hmph. They never learn.

Announcement: Commencing test. All personnel must evacuate area. Commencing test.

[While the door is open, Red deftly runs into the control room and bounces off the wall in front of Hojo. He bares his teeth and attacks, but is trapped hanging in the air.]

Hojo: Be a good boy and keep the other pets company.

Barret: Shit. Looks like Red might need our help up there! C'mon! We're going!

[They defeat the robots and run to the control room where Red is frozen in the air.]

Barret: Get outta here!

[He shoots the work of the manager keeping Red in the air.]

Barret: What was that thing?

Cloud: Where's Hojo?

Red XIII: Sorry. He got away.

Cloud: Forget about him for now.

Barret: Remind me. This ain't a hospital, is it?

Red XIII: Test subjects don't receive treatment.

[The squad enters a warehouse stacked with medical screens of various sizes, including giant ones.]

Cloud: They're enhanced… or dissected.

Barret: This guy's a real piece of work…

[When the squad comes to the exit the screen closes it and starts flying around the warehouse around them.]

Barret: Now what!? Hey, let us out!

[A spherical flying robot appears from behind the screens and holds Red down with a force field.]

Barret: I remember you!

Red XIII: And he remembers us, I think.

[The squad wins the battle despite the fact that the robot brings his friends as helpers and emerges to a huge hangar with a huge cistern in the center, into which several thick tubes are stuck. The door closes behind their backs.]

Barret: Fine! One step at a time it is.

Red XIII: I don't see any elevators around here.

Cloud: I’ll let Tifa and Aerith know.

Barret: Huh, whaddya know. That's the door to the 4th ward.

Red XIII: If we want to get in, we'll need to go all the way back to the central terminal.

Barret: But the door we used to get here is shut. So what now?

Cloud: The passages have to be connected somehow.

[They come to a blocked passageway and Cloud asks Red to jump to the other side.]

Cloud: Please.

Barret: It's a PHS terminal. Call up Tifa, see if they can get to the central terminal.

[Several containers open and hostile creatures from the Black Lagoon jump out of them.]

Barret: Hey! You okay down there?

[Cloud defeats the robots on his side, but Red fails to deal with his own.]

Red XIII: Dammit!

Barret: Shit! He can't hold them off forever! You should call Tifa.

Cloud: Right. On it.

[He calls Tifa through the intercom.]

Cloud: Tifa, you there?

Tifa: Is something wrong?

Cloud: Red fell to your level. Can you try to get to him?

[The control is switched to Tifa.]

Aerith: Oh no!

Tifa: Come on!

[The girls run to Red fighting the robots.]

Aerith: Sorry for the wait!

Tifa: Now, let's get this over with! Let's finish this!

[She knocks the creature off the floor with a punch.]

Tifa: You okay?

Red XIII: I am now.

Barret: Nice one!

Tifa: Have Cloud and Barret found anything?

Red XIII: Actually, they just found the entrance to the 4th ward. But to unlock it, they have to access the central terminal which they cannot do from their position.

Aerith: Maybe we can get to it instead.

Tifa: Yeah, let's try.

[Now Red joins the girls! He helps them push the lever that remove the pods.]

Red XIII: Now it's my turn.

Aerith: Look! An elevator! ...And it's not moving.

Red XIII: The professor still has plans for us, I presume.

Aerith: For the record, I don't like this one bit.

Red XIII: All that remains is the 4th ward. We must trust in Cloud and Barret to see it through.

[Tifa pushes a few switches.]

Announcement: Transfusion procedure complete. Commencing test of augmented research specimen.

Tifa: This was a good idea… right?

Aerith: Yep! Let's go give the others the news.

[Tifa calls Cloud using an intercom.]

Cloud: That you?

Tifa: Yeah. We found an elevator on our side.

Cloud: Good. Glad to hear it.

Tifa: But… we can't use it for some reason.

Aerith: Hojo did something. I know it.

Red XIII: There's only one thing we can do. We need to head to the 4th ward, just like he wants.

Tifa: We unlocked it on our side. You should be able to get in.

Cloud: Thanks. Wait for us there.

[The control switches to Cloud.]

Barret: Right. Now we head back to that door. We, uh, made Wedge wait a while to be rescued.

Cloud: Guess so.

Barret: You know, he really likes you.

Cloud: Maybe.

Barret: Friendly guy, but he has a hard time opening up to people.

Cloud: Well… that makes two of us.

Barret: He's got your back, though. Heh… makes two of us.

[They walk down a long tubular tunnel. Cloud stops when he hears something.]

Barret: Huh. You hear that?

[Something is rushing toward them at breakneck speed.]

Cloud: Run!

[It is a giant mechanical flying millipede. Cloud and Barret run out of the tunnel into a vast room. The door closes behind them.]

Barret: Flyin' fishbot here's trying to turn us into mincemeat!

[After defeating the millipede, it starts running around the room.]

Barret: It’s outta control!

Cloud: Dammit!

[The millipede flies to the girls.]

Tifa: What the—!?

Aerith: I think it's coming this way!

[The girls also have to fight the multipede. They defeat it and it explodes.]

Aerith: That's enough…

[Meanwhile, Hojo keeps a close eye on what's going on through the cameras...]

Hojo: (laughs) Again you triumph! I'd be disappointed if you didn't! Yes... I believe I have just about all the data that I require. Then we are ready to proceed to the next stage.

[He presses a few buttons on the keyboard and also notices someone on the monitor, which gets him excited.]

Aerith: Yes! We got it to work!

Tifa: Could this be a trap?

Aerith: Don't worry. The elevators are safe.

Tifa: All right. If you say so.

[They get into the elevator. The doors close.]

Tifa: Huh? Are we there already.

Aerith: No, something tells me that we aren't. Call it a hunch.

[They come out on the very floor where Cloud and Barret are stuck.]

Red XIII: I hear something.

Barret: We don't have all day, you know.

Tifa: I think it might be locked from this side.

Aerith: Should we open it up then?

[Tifa presses the handle but the door just falls off due to damage.]

Barret: Uh... Cloud...

Aerith: Heya, guys!

Barret: Oh… hey. Band's back together. Past time we got outta here and made our way(to the roof.

Red XIII: There's an elevator just over there. But it will move only at Hojo's discretion.

[The squad, finally in its full strength, emerges from the tunnel to the elevator.]

Tifa: Well, okay then. Looks like the elevator's working.

Red XIII: It appears Hojo's done having his fun.

Barret: (laughs) Glad to hear he enjoyed the show.

[The squad takes the elevator up.]

Tifa: We're back… again.

Cloud: Yeah.

Barret: Hey. What the hell's going on?

[The giant cistern in the center of the room to which the tubes were connected is open.]

Tifa: Who would…?

[Red notices the glowing footprints.]

Red XIII: We may find out soon.

Cloud: Let's go.

[They go to the elevator.]

Barret: So what's above this floor?

Red XIII: The president's office. And then the roof.

[The elevator doors open. There are glowing tracks inside.]

Aerith: Wait. Once we get in that elevator, there's no turning back.

Tifa: We're ready… right?

Cloud: Huh?

Red XIII: The eksater-back there can take us down to the central terminal again. Now's the time for any unfinished business.

Cloud: I'm ready to do this. Let's go.

[The squad gets in the elevator and goes up to the 69th floor to the president's apartment. They follow the tracks.]

Barret: Where the hell is that bastard hiding?

Tifa: And Sephiroth?

Red XIII: Wait. I can hear something.

[They find the president hanging from the edge of the roof.]

President Shinra: Help me...

Barret: Well, well, well...

President Shinra: Pull me up! I'll give you all the money you want! I have gil! Plenty of it!

Barret: Thing is, I don't want your money.

President Shinra: Please! 

[He's losing his grip, but Barret grabs his arm and lifts him up, but he's in no hurry to save him.]

President Shinra: Just let me live. Everything you want can be yours.

Barret: I'm a man of modest dreams. Dropping you from seventy stories up would get me damn near to good.

President Shinra: But not all the way. You want something more, don't you!?

Barret: More than this right here? Talk to me again like you know me.

[He lowers him and smothers with his own collar under the weight of the president's own weight.]

Tifa: Barret!

Aerith: Stop it!

[Barret rudely throws the president onto the roof. He walks hard after him and the president tries to escape.]

Barret: You're gonna get on TV and tell ‘em. Tell 'em what you did to Sector 7—that it was you who killed all those people! Then, you're gonna tell them the truth about Avalanche. That Avalanche ain't Wutai or anybody's puppet! That Avalanche fights for the people—the planet! That we fight to hold Shinra to account for its crimes! That is Avalanche! The filthy sewer rats… who brought down a goliath! You tell 'em that.

[The president stops running and regains his composure.]

President Shinra: Is that really all you want? For your names to be cleared? Hmph. That is what matters most to you? More than shutting down the reactors? Than the future of the planet itself?

Barret: Damn.

[The president pulls out a gun and points it at Barret.]

President Shinra: You're lying to yourself, even now. Truth… justice, honor, freedom! Vain indulgences, every one. Picture it! Picture a world without Shinra. Without mako energy. A stagnant, impotent world. Now picture a natural disaster. Who would help the people? Help them recover and rebuild? You? With their old world ruined, will they thank you for the nеw? I'm going to give you a chance.

[The rest of the squad runs up.]

President Shinra: One last opportunity to consider what your principles are truly worth. But bear in mind that time is of the essence.

Barret: And what about you Mister President. What are your vaunted principles?

President Shinra: What principles!? Did you understand even a single word of what I told you? I know what I want, and I take it. I take advantage of whatever I can, and discard that which I cannot. There is no room for sentiment or guilt.

[The president prepares to pull the trigger, but is pierced by Sephiroth's long katana.]

Barret: You son of a bitch!

[He, as usual, thoughtlessly tries to attack an opponent he hasn't faced, and... gets a katana in his stomach. The others in the slo-mo run towards him. Cloud stands there like a stone statue.]

Tifa: Barret!

[With a sly smile Sephiroth disappears into the vortex, turning into a shapeless giant monster. Cloud finally comes to his senses and pulls out his huge piece of iron.]

Red XIII: This is...

Aerith: The source. Of everything.

[The battle begins!]

Tifa: What's happening?

Red XIII: It's an illusion. Stay calm.

[The squad fights long and hard against a boss named Jenova Dreamweaver.]

Red XIII: You okay? We almost have her—keep at it!

[The boss is defeated and the illusion is dispelled. In reality it turns out to be some guy in a hood with the number 49 on his shoulder. Cloud wants to approach him, but Sephiroth gets in his way. He takes the guy in his arms and smiles insidiously again. A helicopter flies up to the building.]

Avalanche Helicopter: HQ, this is Avalanche 3-1. Making another pass to search for friendlies.

[Whispers fly out of Barret and he comes to himself as if awakened from a dream.]

Tifa: Barret! Are you hurt!?

Barret: Don't think so.

Red XIII: This death was not the one ordained for you by fate.

Barret: Thanks.

[Cloud follows the departed Whispers.]

Cloud: Sephiroth!

[Sephiroth transforms into another guy in a hoodie with the number 2 tattooed on it. He jumps off the top of the tower into the abyss with his fallen comrade. Cloud returns to the others.]

Cloud: Everyone okay?

Barret: Hey. Get your man?

Cloud: He got away.

Barret: 'Bout time we made our escape too.

[Someone is blowing up an Avalanche helicopter... it's a Shinra helicopter.]

Cloud: Shit.

Reno: Sure you wanna do this personally, boss?

[The coin-playing Rufus approaches the door of the helicopter.]

Barret: If it ain't Rufus Shinra. Heir to the throne himself.

[Reno and Rude land the helicopter on the roof. Rufus emerges from it, along with a huge Doberman on a chain, as well as several elite soldiers.]

Cloud: Yep.

[Helicopter rises into the air.]

Cloud: Stop.

Barret: Huh!? The hell I will! We can finish off the family here and now!

Cloud: Take Aerith and get outta here. I'll buy you guys some time.

Barret: I would stay here—back you up.

Cloud: Barret… I'm asking you. Please.

Barret: Fine. Have it your way then. But you better be right behind us!

[They run away.]

Rufus: You're a SOLDIER, aren't you? Which, of course, would mean that I own you.

Cloud: EX-SOLDIER. I quit.

Rufus: Secure the others. 

[The soldiers set off in pursuit. A helicopter shot prevents Cloud from attacking them.]

Rufus: Just the two of us. 

[He pulls out a gun.]

Rufus: Well. Maybe three.

Cloud: Let's get this over with.

Rufus: Don't say that. Hmph. Not bad. Okay.

Air Traffic Controller: This is control. Hostile air units sighted. Redirect to engage.

Rude: Understood.

[The helicopter flies away.]

Cloud: Think you got my number?

Rufus: Not at all. You're making me sweat. Good thing I came prepared.

[He pulls out two coins and tosses them, and when he shoots right in the center of it two powerful laser beams shoot out. Cloud dodges.]

Cloud: That's a new trick.

Rufus: Like it? 'Course you do.

[Cloud defeats the Doberman.]

Cloud: Now it's just the two of us.

Rufus: Let's make it a night to remember.

Cloud: It's on for real now?

Rufus: Yeah. You should be honored.

[Cloud defeats the arrogant jerk.]

Cloud: I could end this—here and now.

Rufus: No, not quite. Tonight marks a new beginning for Shinra!

[He grabs hold of the floor of a passing helicopter and flies away. The helicopter shoots at Cloud and he almost falls off the building, catching the fragment of the roof with one hand but not going to throw the huge piece of iron that he has in his other hand. Tifa, who quickly runs up, manages to grab him.]

Tifa: You gotta be better than this… if you're gonna play the hero.

[Cloud squeezes Tifa's hand tighter. Apparently he was contemplating suicide. Meanwhile, Barret, Red XIII and Aerith are riding the antigravity elevator.]

Red XIII: Think they can manage on their own?

Barret: You’ve seen them both in action. You know they can. Besides—

[They hear an explosion.]

Barret: What was that!?

[He notices the explosion on the roof.]

Barret: Gotta believe they made it out.

Aerith: I hope so.

Barret: Dammit!

Red XIII: Hey.

Barret: Screw it—we gotta go back!

Red XIII: Hey!

Barret: What, Red!?

[They have several machine guns aimed at them by the robot riding in the next elevator!]

Barret: Get down!

[Meanwhile, on the 64th floor, a fat ninja sneaks down the halls. He hears an explosion and flinches.]

Wedge: We're cool. Everything's cool.

[He sees an elevator rush past him with Barret and the others.]

Wedge: Barret!

[He incongruously looks around and begins to think where he should run to. But the small number of brains he has doesn't provide any sane answer. Suddenly the Whispers appear.]

Wedge: Not again! 

[The fatty tries to fight the powerful flow of wind.]

Wedge: You can't stop me! For Biggs... For Jessie… Tifa… and Barret too!

[Naturally his zero physical training does not allow him to do anything and he falls out the window.]

Wedge: I'm sorry, Cloud… Just… tell me that—that I made a difference…

[I'll let myself answer his stupid question - no, you are worthless ballast that puts the entire terrorist organization at risk. Meanwhile, we move to the 59th floor to the head of the organization. He, inexplicably surviving, opens the doors of the destroyed elevator.]

Barret: Hey. Still in one piece?

Aerith: Yeah. Somehow.

[Red sighs, not even surprised by the jerk's blatant tactlessness again. Meanwhile, the robot in the next elevator catches up with them!]

Barret: Oh, you gotta be kidding me! 

[They jump to the 58th floor running away from machine gun fire.]

Barret: Okay, you asked for it, mech! Open wide!

[He fires a charged ball of plasma at a robot that looks capable of destroying an entire tank column.]

Barret: And suck on this!

[The shot does no damage as expected.]

Red XIII: Get ready.

Barret: I was born ready, Red.

[They engage in combat with a death machine with two machine guns, shields, combat drones and the ability to maneuver quickly.]

Arsenal: Barrier drones damaged. Overriding safety protocols.

Aerith: It looks like it's charging up.

Barret: Ha! I'll blow it to pieces!

Arsenal: Defensive systems compromised. Threat level: elevated. Threat level: critical.

Barret: We piss it off?

Arsenal: Treat level maximum.

Aerith: This doesn't look good!

Barret: Any ideas!?

Red XIII: Take cover behind debris!

Aerith: They all just… flew off.

Barret: If more come, we're done.

Red XIII: Then let's finish this quick.

Barret: Not this again!

Aerith: We can't hide! What do we do!?

Barret: Stop its attack!

[Somehow the squad manages to survive and defeat The Arsenal.]

Barret: Damn, does it feel good to be alive!

Red XIII: Quite. But we could still die later tonight. Cloud and Tifa could be dead already.

Barret: The hell they are!

Red XIII: Then we need to find a way we can all escape and quickly.

Aerith: You're right. Let's go.

[Meanwhile, the building is already surrounded on all sides by Shinra soldiers. The not-so-smart heroes decide to leave through the front door.]

Barret: All we gotta do now is find the others.

[They are surrounded. Heidegger himself comes out.]

Security Officer: We have them surrounded, sir.

Heidegger: Yes... I can see that. It was only a matter of time. And here we are. (laughs) So then what is this ragtag group of misfits I see before me?

Barret: Avalanche!

Aerith: Local florist!

Red XIII: Lab rat dog.

Heidegger: And where are the rest of you?

Barret: Up your ass.

Heidegger: Charming. Though not what I would've chosen as my last words. Secure the Ancient, but feel free to kill both the idiot and the dog.

Barret: Aerith. You saved my Marlene. Now... it's time I returned the favor.

Aerith: Wait!

[Everyone present hears the roar of an engine. Cloud rides into the lobby on his motorcycle, having jumped off the second floor.]

Aerith: Cloud!

Hejdegger: Goddammit!

[A lot of soldiers start shooting at Cloud with their machine guns but no one in the small room manages to hit him, and he shoots them down with his motorcycle. Suddenly Tifa appears in a very funny little blue truck.]

Tifa: Everyone, get in!

Heidegger: Stop them, you fools! Don't let them escape!

[Cloud, meanwhile, continues to humiliate the laws of physics in every way possible by fighting the soldiers. When the resistance is crushed, he drives up to Tifa's truck.]

Cloud: Let's roll.

Tifa: Okay!

Barret: Why's he always gotta—

[The funny little truck moves off and drives away at 15 kilometers per hour (9 mph for our American friends).]

Barret: Shit.

[After humiliating a couple more soldiers, they fly out the window onto the road and drive off into the night.]

Chapter 18: Destiny’s Crossroads
[Tifa drives her funny truck on the night highway.]

Barret: Home free, Red!

Red XIII: I wouldn’t celebrate just yet.

Barret: Man, you need to lighten up. Hell, you might even try smiling.

[Red turns to him and smiles comically, showing a grin.]

Barret: On second thought… maybe frowning suits you better. Hey, don’t pout!

Red XIII: Look.

[Many Whispers are gathered into a single stream.]

Barret: Are you guys seeing this!?

[Cloud and Tifa stop.]

Aerith: Whispers.

[Whispers envelop the Shinra building.]

Rufus: What is all this?

Tseng: Is something wrong, sir? 

[He's distracted by the phone.]

Tseng: I see. Very good. The men are on standby, sir. Your orders?

Rufus: Bring them in.

Barret: It's like the whole damn building’s made of ‘em.

Cloud: Yeah.

Tifa: I don't understand. What are they doing?

Aerith: Who knows...

Barret: Wedge you don't think he got caught up in it do you?

Tifa: If he did, I hope he's okay...

Red XIII: They're coming.

Barret: Who?

[They are already being chased by Shinra soldiers on motorcycles.]

Barret: This, we don't need.

Cloud: Time to go!

[He gets on his motorcycle and Barret jumps into the back of Tifa's truck. The chase begins! We even get to drive Cloud's motorcycle. He fights the soldiers.]

Barret: How the hell'd we get saddled with this junker!?

Security Officer: Give it up! There's nowhere to run!

Security Officer: Pull over right now! We will use lethal force to make you comply!

Red XIII: Circle around to the other side. Careful—stay out of the line of fire.

Barret: Stubborn bastards!

Aerith: Look!

Tifa: Come on!

[Ahead of him there is a roadblock with soldiers with shields lined up. Cloud knocks the wheel of the truck of the soldiers ahead of him with his motorcycle, and his weight rams the barrier.]

Barret: And let that be a lesson to you!

Shinra Helicopter: Firing warning shots.

Cloud: Heads up!

Barret: That chopper is all mine. I'll bring it down real quick!

Red XIII: Cloud, here!

Barret: Try catching us now, ya bastards!

Red XIII: I hate to spoil the celebration, but… there's more.

[They are attacked by flying robots.]

Aerith: Uh, what the!?

Red XIII: Keep your guard up! Its guard is down. Now!

Barret: Cloud! Keep your guard up! That's it! Now seize the opening and attack!

Red XIII: Its guard is down. Now!

Barret: Ha ha ha! How do you like that?

Red XIII: Cloud, you all right?

Cloud: Get down!

[The top of the bridge they are traveling over turns out to be booby-trapped. Barrett shoots at the mines. The Whispers appear.]

Barret: Them again!? Guess we owe you another!

[The helicopter and soldiers on motorcycles catch up with the unit again.]

Barret: Shit! We got incoming! I'll take the chopper! The bikes are all yours, Cloud!

Mobile Officer: We've got 'em! Engaging targets.

Shinra Helicopter: Targets acquired. Preparing to engage targets. Targeting vehicles' wheels! Firing warning shots.

Barret: Ha! Think you can take us? Well think again, asshole!

Shinra Helicopter: Preparing to engage targets. Targeting vehicles' wheels! Targets acquired.

Barret: That's it—I'm takin' you down! We done here!?

Cloud: You good?

Aerith: Somehow!

Red XIII: Cloud, you okay?

Barret: So… now they're on our side?

Red XIII: The Whispers intervene not to defend us, but to preserve the flow of destiny.

[Next to them on the next track is a robot that looks like The Armory!]

Barret: Oh, no, don't you dare! C'mon! You see the piece of shit we're driving here?

Red XIII: Says the three hundred pound sack of it.

{300 pounds equal 136 kilograms}

Barret: Hey!

Tifa: Focus!

[Cloud begins to fight the robot without slowing down.]

Aerith: We gotta give it our all! Every little bit helps.

Cloud: Meet them head-on.

Barret: Get your ass in gear!

Tifa: Gotta be smart.

Aerith: I don't want any trouble!

Barret: Okay, y'all! Let's finish him off! C'mon!

Red XIII: Cloud!

Cloud: Copy!

[Red jumps onto the seat of Cloud's motorcycle.]

Cloud: Go for the head.

Red XIII: With pleasure.

[Together they attack and destroy the giant robot, and Red returns to Tifa's truck. The robot flies off the track and explodes. After that, Sephiroth gets in their way. Cloud stops abruptly, but there is no one on the road.]

Barret: Okay, asshole, let's—

Aerith: Don't. (to Sephiroth) And you... You're wrong.

Sephiroth: Those who look with clouded eyes see nothing but shadows.

Aerith: Everything about you is wrong.

Sephiroth: All born are bound to her. Should this world be unmade, so too shall her children.

Cloud: The world won't end today. But you… 

[He pulls out his giant sword.]

Cloud: You will.

[The whirlpool of Whispers around the Shinra building reaches a critical point.]

Sephiroth: Listen.

[The stream bursts aloft, wafting away across the sky. They envelop the battle zone.]

Sephiroth: Destiny comes.

[Cloud grabs his head and suddenly the game changes, as if many years have passed. We are introduced to another character named Zack, who walks to the Shinra building through the desert, where he is met by many soldiers of the organization.]

Zack: We drag our asses all this way… and this is the welcome we get. Boy, oh boy… The price of freedom is steep.

[He pulls out a huge sword like Cloud's. Judging by his equipment and weapons, we can conclude that he, too, is a SOLDIER. He raises the sword and prays.]

Zack: Embrace your dreams. And, whatever happens… Protect your honor… as a SOLDIER! Come and get it!

[He attacks and we return to Cloud and his terrorist friends. Sephiroth cuts the stream from Whispers with his long sword.]

Sephiroth: I'm waiting, Cloud.

[He goes into the stream. Cloud goes after him, but Aerith grabs his hand.]

Aerith: This is the point of no return. 

[She does something to the stream making it glow with a bright light.]

Aerith: Destiny's crossroads.

Cloud: Then why did you stop me?

Aerith: I'm not really sure.

Tifa: What will we find on the other side?

Aerith: Freedom. Boundless, terrifying freedom. Like a great, never-ending sky. What you heard just now were the voices of the planet. Those born into this world. Who lived and who died. Who returned. They're howling in pain.

Cloud: Because of him? Sephiroth?

Aerith: They... Their words… they don't reach him. All these moments and memories, precious and fleeting… they're like rain rolling off his back… And when they're gone, he won't cry… or shout… or anything. He'd tell you that he only cares about the planet. That he'd do everything in his power to protect and preserve it. But this isn't the way it's supposed to be. There's no greater threat to the planet than him. Sephiroth has to be stopped. He has to be. And that's why… I'm asking you to help me. I know that, together, we can do this. But if we do… We'll be changing more than fate itself. If we succeed… if we win… we'll be changing ourselves… I guess… maybe that's why I hesitated.

[A powerful scream coupled with a gust of wind comes from the stream.]

Cloud: You said it yourself. He has to be stopped. And frankly, I've heard enough howling for a lifetime.

Barret: So if we go through that thing, there's no coming back? I don't know what kind of freedom we're buying… but I know it'll cost us.

Red XIII: Is it our destiny to defy destiny? It's an interesting question. Will there be Whispers on the other side?

Tifa: Cloud, we should go. If we wait any longer, I dunno...

Aerith: Thank you, Cloud. Whatever happens, we'll be okay… as long as we stick together.

[Cloud approaches the glowing hole in the stream.]

Aerith: Ready?

Tifa: Never tried to challenge destiny.

Red XIII: This could well be her last line of defense. It won’t be easy.

Cloud: Let’s go.

[They all enter the stream, only Barret stays outside.]

Barret: Wouldn't be the first time I spit in destiny's eye. Whether you can see the seams or you can't… doesn’t charge that she's always trying to have it her way. Daddy's coming home real soon, honey!

[He, too, enters the stream. The other side is no different from the usual, only turned the detachment in the opposite direction.]

Barret: Don't know about you, but looks normal to me.

Aerith: Over there.

[A stream of Whispers swirls around, destroying everything around it.]

Barret: Okay, that ain't right!

[They run away, but find themselves sandwiched between two whirlwinds. The squad is lifted into the air and they separate. As they fly, Cloud notices the Shinra building turning into a giant monster. He runs towards it to fight it, meeting Barret and Tifa in the process.]

Barret: You're alive!

Cloud: Happy to see me?

Barret: Wouldn't go that far.

Cloud: So that thing… that's a Whisper too, huh?

Barret: Looks a lot more like an "arbiter of fate" than the others.

Tifa: We can beat them.

[They are surrounded by three mini versions of the Whispers monster with abilities of different elements.]

Barret: Bring it on!

[They do not manage to defeat such strong opponents and when the passageway is vacated they run away.]

Barret: Come on, that ain't fair!

Cloud: Run!

[The passage collapses right under their feet.]

Barret: We gotta go!

Cloud: Just go!

Barret: Shit! Look out! Run, dammit, run! Move your ass!

Tifa: Dammit! 

Barret: We gotta get outta here now!

[They fight the three Whispers again and defeat them.]

Barret: Did we do it!?

Aerith: Hang on!

[Aerith runs up to them.]

Tifa: Aerith!

[The enormous monster shoots some kind of ray at their heads. We see a vision in which Red is running through the same desert in which we saw Zack.]

Barret: What the hell did I just see?

Red XIII: A glimpse of tomorrow if we fail here today.

[The enormous monster strikes and divides the squad. New Whispers appear.]

Barret: Dammit! How do we stop these things!?

Red XIII: Well, the big one is way over there. However...

Cloud: These guys are right here.

[The squad defeats the Whispers and sees a new vision, this time of Tifa - a huge fiery meteorite is flying toward Earth (or whatever their planet is).]

Tifa: This can’t be our future…

Aerith: The future is always a blank page.

[Three more Whispers appear.]

Barret: Them again? Least they could do is give us a little breather!

Cloud: I say we split up. Take 'em down at the same time.

Barret: In that case, ultra big boy's all mine!

[Cloud attacks his Whispers of the fire type.]

Cloud: Bring it on, bitch! Let's do this.

Tifa: Right!

Aerith: We can do this together!

Cloud: Barret, now!

Barret: Ain't no stoppin us now! Gotcha!

Tifa: Did we beat 'em?

Aerith: Think so!

Cloud: Barret, do it!

Barret: Loo gonna show you what Avalanche is made of!

[After defeating the Whispers they begin to fight the enormous monster. Cloud is haunted by visions of the dead Aerith.]

Red XIII: Our fate is ours to shape.

[They do the first serious damage to the building.]

Aerith: We did it!

Tifa: Right.

[They defeat the enormous monster and find themselves in a brightly lit, quiet and peaceful place.]

Cloud: Where are we?

[Aerith shakes his head.]

Sephiroth: I'm waiting, Cloud.

[The clouds are beginning to darken.]

Barret: What the hell is this!?

Red XIII: This is—

[The peals of thunder destroy the ground beneath the squad's feet and they soar upward into the heart of darkness.]

Cloud: Sephiroth… 

[The squad ends up in the ruins of the Shinra Tower. Sephiroth throws a large splinter at them and separates. Cloud is left alone with him.]

Cloud: Let's finish this.

[They are finally starting to fight.]

Sephiroth: Fate is not to be taken lightly, Cloud.

Cloud: Shut up!

Sephiroth: Come, Cloud. Have we forgotten already? The weakness within. Will you weep for me?

[Tifa joins Cloud.]

Tifa: Need some help?

Cloud: Don't know about need… Good to go?

Tifa: You know it!

[The battle continues. Barret joins the fight.]

Tifa: Barret!

Barret: Ain't you two havin' fun!

Cloud: Let's go.

[The battle continues. Aerith and Red join the fight.]

Barret: We get him!?

Tifa: Aerith!

Barret: 'Bout time you showed!

Aerith: We can do this. We can. We can change it—make it right!

Red XIII: Quickly!

[The squad splits up again. Cloud and Sephiroth are left alone.]

Sephiroth: Careful now. That which lies ahead...does not yet exist. Or world will become a part of it… one day. But I… will not end. Nor will have you end.

Cloud: This is...?

Sephiroth: The edge of creation. Cloud, lend me your strength. Let us defy destiny… together.

[He holds out his hand. Cloud, after thinking, draws his sword.]

Cloud: Never.

Sephiroth: Not yet. 

[He knocks the sword out of Cloud's hands.]

Sephiroth: Seven seconds till the end. Time enough for you. Perhaps. But what will you do with it? Let's see.

[We see several of the top Shinra people.]

Heidegger: Mister Vice President.

[Rufus stares out the window in silence.]

Tseng: Mister President.

Rufus: That's right.

[He goes to the president's office where Palmer and Scarlet are already waiting for him. He sits in his chair with a haughty look. Hojo, meanwhile, is cleaning up the aftermath of the battle in his lab. He laughs like a lunatic. Zack, meanwhile, has barely defeated Shinra's army in an alternate future.]

Zack: Wait... Was that all of 'em? Hey, Cloud. You see that?

[We don't see Cloud. An explosion from the Shinra building knocks Zack off his feet and he struggles to get up. The scene ends. We return to the present. A food distribution is organized in the destroyed Sector 7. Treatment of the wounded. The rebuilding of the destroyed one.]

Elmyra: Marlene!

Marlene: Coming!

[A drop of water falls from the flower leaf she just watered.]

Marlene: Daddy...?

[Meanwhile, Barret, many kilometers away, extends his hand.]

Barret: Marlene! I’ll come back.

Tifa: So… what now?

[Aerith shakes his head again.]

Cloud: Sephiroth. Long as he's still out there, I…

Barret: I thought you beat him.

[Cloud shakes his head.]

Aerith: We can. We will.

Tifa: Count me in.

Red XIII: If it's to be a hunt, you could use a nose like mine.

Barret: I'm in too! Bastard wants to destroy the whole planet, doesn't he? An enemy of hers is an enemy of Avalanche!

[It starts to rain. We see Zack dragging Cloud, who is unconscious.]

Zack: Almost there, Cloud. We're almost there...

[At this point, the alternate future and the present intersect.]

Aerith: I miss it. The steel sky.

[An inscription appears on the screen.]

The Unknown Journey Will Continue

THE END
