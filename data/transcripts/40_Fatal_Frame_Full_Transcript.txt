(We hear the voice of a young girl on the background of the night sky.)

Miku Hinasaki: (offscreen) I wonder how long it’s been since my brother and I began to see things other people can’t see. My big brother... he was so sweet and kind… He was only one I can open up to… about these visions. After our mother dies... he was my only family.

September 24th 1986

(Some guy in a white jacket is coming to an old dilapidated Japanese house.)

Mafuyu Hinasaki: So this is Himuro Mansion?

FATAL FRAME

(The guy comes into the house and we hear the voice of a young girl again.)

Miku Hinasaki: (offscreen) My brother was in search of someone. Junsei Takamine. A famous novelist, and a man my brother was very indebted to, disappeared while researching a book. When he told me that he got a lead on Mr. Takamine’s whereabouts... I felt uneasy, like he was going far away.

Himuro. Intro.
(Going into the house the guy turns on the flashlight and begins to explore.)

Mafuyu Hinasaki: The forbidden rituals of this area... It looks like Mr. Takamine was doing research into them. I wonder if he’s group is still here. There’s an angry-looking mask on the wall. There’s a box of film on the floor. I found type-14 film. I think I can use it with my camera. There’s a big mirror... but it only shows my own reflection. There’s a board nailed to the door. Probably been there a while. I’ll try another room.

[Camera Controls 1]
While holding the camera press the CIRCLE button or R1 to take shooting stance, and to enter Finder Mode. You can take photos with the CROSS or R1 button while in Finder Mode.
While in Finder Mode you can control the player’s viewpoint with the Left Analog Stick.
SQUARE Button: Move finder quickly./TRIANGLE Button: Turn around.
Use of the Right Analog Stick to move around while in shooting stance.

(He finds a notebook upstairs...)

Mafuyu Hinasaki: This notebook... It’s Mr. Takamine’s...

(He sees a vision of the past. Mr. Takamine, along with a woman that appears to be his assistant and a guy, that was the editor of his book, enter this very house.)

Junsei Takamine: I wonder if we find anything here...

Tomoe Hirasaka the Assistant: It’s cold.

Koji Ogata the Editor: What a wreck...

(We see that a ghost of a woman in traditional Japanese attire hunted them. The vision ends.)

Mafuyu Hinasaki: That was Mr. Takamine… so he did come here.

(Mafuyu hears someone coming up the stairs. He pulls out his camera, getting ready to shoot.)

[Shooting Ghosts]
Hold up the camera with the CIRCLE Button, and press the shutter with the CROSS Button to attack ghosts. When the target is inside the circle, power (Mystical Power) accumulates. The damage you inflict on the ghost goes up as you accumulate more power in the camera.
Shutterbug Moment
While you have the ghost in your viewfinder, and the circle glows, take a shot. You can inflict heavy damage when you take a shot during Shutterbug Moment.

(Mafuyu defeats the ghost, shooting him to death.)

Mafuyu Hinasaki: I captured ghost with this camera... This camera has the ability to exposed things I can’t see. I remember the incident from which I learned of this unique powers to capture ghosts. The staircase has fallen down. Probably been down a while. Nothing to do with Takamine. The door to the entrance is open. But I’m sure it was just closed a while ago…

(He goes out into the Rope Hallway and sees someone. The screen fades.)

Miku Hinasaki: (offscreen) It’s been two weeks since I last heard from my brother. But he left a note that lead me to this place. I felt as though... something was calling me here…

(She comes up to to the house.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mafuyu…

The Strangling Ritual / 1st Night
(Miku begins to explore the house.)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s something on the floor. I got the herbal medicine. There’s an angry-looking mask on the wall. There’s an old camera here. I think I can take a shot. (saves the game)

Ghost: The ropes... There are more ropes now…

Miku Hinasaki: There is a small piece of paper on the floor. It looks like a piece of a notebook.

[Research Notes]
September 12th
Now there’s another rope!
And another rope...!

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file.

(She walks into the Rope Hallway and sees a camera lying on the floor. She touches it and sees a vision in which Mafuyu runs away from the ghosts, but in the end they overtake him.)

Mafuyu Hinasaki: ...Miku!

Miku Hinasaki: Did something happened to my brother? I picked up my brother’s camera and notebook from the floor. Mom’s old camera. My brother had this with him… I found a new note inside Mafuyu’s notebook.

[Mafuyu’s Notebook]
Himuro Mansion Investigation
Himuro Mansion was once the home of a large landowner that controlled vast areas of land. They also say that the site held some special significance that had to do with Shinto rituals of the region. (I couldn’t find any detailed books about these Shinto rituals, though.)
The last master of the Himuro family line massacred his entire household. Later, another family that tried to live there disappeared. Because of incidents like these, nobody visits the mansion today, and it lies in ruins.
Maybe that’s why there aren’t any accounts of the Shinto rituals, and why the exact location of the place isn’t recorded anywhere.
September 24th
I’ve had a bad feeling ever since I came to this mansion. I’m leaving notes in this notebook just in case anything happens to me. I’ve got to find Mr. Takamine and the others fast... I hope it’s not too late!

Miku Hinasaki: There are many other notes and news articles inside the notebook. There are lots of antiques here, but in poor repair. The owner’s hobby, maybe? There’s a lion mask on the chest of drawers. There is a medicine container near the ornamental lion mask. I got the herbal medicine.

[Black Notebook Scrap]
Plot of My Next Work
- Junsei Takamine
A series of murders in a country village. Dead bodies turn up one after another. Murders that resemble cruel Shinto rituals of legend in the area. The acts of a man sworn to revenge, and the strange correlation between those acts and the folklore. The man is gradually more and more influenced by the legends. The work will be the story of this man, proceeding in parallel with the Tails of the local lore, records of the past discovered after an earthquake. The story gradually blurs the boundary between the present and the past.
July 24th - about Himuro Mansion
Himuro Mansion is known as the home of a large landowner that the controlled this region. But they say it what’s the original name of the place a shrine was built for performing a certain Shinto ritual, passed down through the generations. But the people of that time kept the ritual a deep, dark secret. They were even forbidden to speak its name aloud. Today, almost no accounts of the ritual exist, aside from a smattering of folklore legends.

Miku Hinasaki: I found a news clipping inside the notebook. There are news articles inside the notebook.

[News Clipping]
The earthquake the other day destroyed all five mirrors (that Holy Mirrors) which artifacts kept for centuries in the five shrines. These mirrors represent of the five gods’ protection over this region. Most commonly known for the “Five Gods Festival” help every 10 years, when all five mirrors gather in one shrine. The priests of the shrine hope that this isn’t a bad omen. 

Miku Hinasaki: I put the notebook and news article in my file. Old books. They’re about dark rituals. Did they belong to the man that lived here? Lots of antiques here. They might’ve been worth something at some point. It looks like there’s something inside the drawer of the chest. It’s locked. I hear something on the other side of the door. Maybe someone’s in there?

(When Miku goes to the first floor, a ghost girl in a white kimono approaches her. She points at her camera and then at the screen.)

Miku Hinasaki: Should I take a photo?

[Camera Controls - 2]
In Finder mode, you can see things that can’t be seen with a naked eye. Try taking a photo if the controller vibrates, or you hear strange noises.

(Miku photographs the screen and sees that there is something behind it. She pushes the screen away.)

Miku Hinasaki: Just like in the photo… There seems to be a hidden door behind the folding screen.

Ghost: I can’t find the key... Where is it?

Miku Hinasaki: There is a small piece of paper on the chest. It looks like a news clipping.

[News Clipping]
Late yesterday, a human body with no limbs was found in Himuro Mountain, located in the southern region of the prefecture. The body’s hands, feet, and head were all torn off. The police is investigating the case as both a murder and accident.
The body has not been identified, but it is believed to be a man around the age of 30. The police is also taking into consideration the fact that a body, mutilated in the same manner, was found in the same location 15 years ago.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the news article in my file. There’s a box of film underneath the window. It looks like a new roll of film. I wonder if Mafuyu left it here? What was that? I found a tape recorder in the closet. It’s covered with dust, but it seems to work. An audio tape has been left inside the tape recorder. An audio tape with a white label. It’s stopped in the middle.

[White Tape 1]
Koji Ogata’s Voice: September 9th - 5:40 PM… The mansion was nowhere to be seen on the map, so we finally had to ask the locals how to find it. They told us that Himuro Mansion had been empty for several decades now. The same ones who told us where it was also warned us not to come here, which was quite disconcerting.

Miku Hinasaki: It looks like a small mirror stand, but the mirror is missing. The drawer is locked.

Ghost of Koji Ogata: Hey…

(Miku turns and sees the editor’s ghost.)

Ghost of Koji Ogata: Help me… Help me…

(Miku defeats him with the camera.)

Miku Hinasaki: The camera began to glow with mystical power… The camera’s seal…!

[Power-ups]
About Power-ups 
You can acquire Mystical Power by damaging ghosts. Select "Camera" from the Menu Screen (TRIANGLE Button) to access the Power-up/ Screen. You can unlock the -seal on the camera with the accumulated Mystical Power, and power up.
About Auxiliary Functions
When you unlock Auxiliary Functions Seal, you enable many special attacks. To use the enabled Auxiliary Function, press the L1 Button while in a shooting stance. The number of Auxiliary Functions you can use is limited to the number of Spirit Stones in your inventory, so be frugal.

Miku Hinasaki: There is something underneath the window. The audio tape with the white label seems to be okay.

[White Tape 2]
Koji Ogata’s Voice: September 9th - 9:40 PM… It seemed dangerous to walk through the mountain at night, so we decided to spend the night here and continue our work. I’ve been through several rooms already. Unlike the exterior, the interior is still in quite good shape. A little earlier, I thought I saw a white shadowy figure of a woman in the hallway near the entrance. I’ll keep track of such sightings, and publish them in a later account.

Miku Hinasaki: I can feel something coming from the mirror stand…

(Miku takes a photo of the stand.)

Miku Hinasaki: Something shows in the photo. It looks like the lion mask hear sunken fireplace. I put the photo in my file.

(She goes back to the lion mask.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is something reflecting light inside the ornamental lion mask. I found a red hand mirror inside the ornamental lion mask. I got the red hand mirror.

(She puts the mirror to the stand.)

Miku Hinasaki: (takes a photo from the drawer) It’s that person I just saw... (sees ghostly ropes around his neck) Oh! The ropes!

[Koji Ogata’s Photo.]
Miku Hinasaki: I can see the faint shadows of ropes on the man’s neck, arms and legs. I got a small key from the drawer.

(The ghost of Koji Ogata attacks Miku but she managed to defeat and capture him with her camera.)

Ghost of Koji Ogata: Let me out! Let me out of this mansion!

Miku Hinasaki: There’s something shiny where the ghost once stood.

[She picks up the item]

[Spirit Stone.]
This mysterious stone enhances the camera’s power and enables Auxiliary Functions.

(She goes to the second floor and opens the locked door.)

[Research Scrap]
Secret Rituals of the Himuro Family
Many rituals and customs have been passed down through generations of the Himuro family. Most of them are lost. The only things we have left now are some documents that record these rituals as a legend.
Hardly any of the oral history remains. This is because all Himuro family members are dead, and those who were close to the family have kept quiet about the ritual.
One ritual in particular, performed on December 13th, is shrouded in mystery. People who lived near the mansion stayed inside on that particular day, and even now, it is considered bad luck to leave the windows open on that date.
I can only assume that this is due to the cruel nature of the ritual, but the truth remains unknown.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the book describing the Himuro family in my file. The sliding screen paper is torn. I can see into the room. Rows of old books. A library. Looks like an old brazier. There’s so much dust inside it that I can’t see the bottom. There is an audio tape in front of the doll. An audio tape with red label. It’s labeled "Research-1"

[Red Tape 1]
Tomoe Hirasaka’s Voice: September 10th - 10:20 AM... We discovered some disturbing photos in a chest of drawers. Could these be the folklorist’s children mentioned in Koji’s notes? The photo is quite old, and shows some kids playing tag... In the corner of the photo there’s a faint image of a young girl in a white kimono. Her finger is pointed this way and she looks as if she’s making some silent accusation.

Miku Hinasaki: There are several pieces of paper on the shelf. They look like part of a red notebook.

[Red Notebook Scrap]
August 20th
It seems a folklorist named Ryozo Munakata was studying about the various rituals passed down at Himuro Mansion. He supposedly left a book of research, but I can’t find it anywhere. I wonder if there’s a copy in a library somewhere?
August 30th
I still can’t find the book. I’ll have Koji Ogata from the editing department do a search for it. I doubt he’ll be able to find it, though.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file. There’s a small door here, but it’s nailed shut. I can’t open it.

Ghost of Tomoe Hirasaka: I didn’t want to come here… My instincts told me not to… (Miku approaches her) There are rope marks on my body... Just like Koji…

[Red Notebook Scrap]
August 27th
The more I find out about Himuro Mansion, the creepier it gets. I’m sure it’s the perfect subject matter from Mr. Takamine’s next book, but, to be perfectly honest, I don’t like this assignment one bit. It gives me a bad feeling...
There’s no way I want to go to that mansion. But it’s my job, right? I guess I’ll have to go. And I wouldn’t want to waste the chance to work with Mr. Takamine just because of a little bit of uneasiness, either.
It doesn’t help I have this sixth sense for the supernatural, either. There’s such a thing as knowing TOO much, sometimes...

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file. The door is stuck fast. I tried pulling on it, but it wouldn’t budge.

(She goes down to the first floor and sees the ghost of her brother.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mafuyu... Oh! Wait!

(The ghost goes behind the corner. Miku runs after him, but instead the angry ghost of a woman comes out.)

Ghost: Give back! Give back! Give back my child!

(Miku defeats the ghost.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is a small piece of paper in the crevice. I think I can reach it…

[Old News Article]
On the night of 3rd, the police received a report that four children failed to return home after 9pm. There is an old superstition in the surrounding villages about children being snatched away by ghosts, and some villagers indeed suspect that this is what has happened to the four kids.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the news article in my file. There is an old scroll among the fallen candles.

[Strangling Ritual]
On the 13th day of the 12th month, a maiden, cut off from the outside world for 3669 long days, shall be torn apart to provide power to the rope.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the old document in my file.

Ghost of Tomoe Hirasaka: That girl… She’s trying to say something… something… important.

Miku Hinasaki: There are several pieces of paper on the shelf. They look like part of a red notebook.

[Red Notebook Scrap]
September 11th, 6:30 am
I saw that woman in the white kimono again. She’s trying to tell me something. She knows I have this special sense for ghostly things... The woman’s name is... Kirie. So, it’s Kirie, huh?
I shouldn’t get any closer than this. I don’t want to get any closer... I’m scared.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file. There’s a box for a mortuary tablet and bone remains among the candles. The owner’s…? There is something shiny on the shelf. (Spirit Stone)

(Miku takes a photo of a door that somehow... calls to her.)

Miku Hinasaki: Some other place shows in the photo. I wonder if there’s something there...?

Faint Ghost Voice: Suffering…

(There is an old scroll on the bare ground.)

[Five Stones Document]
Give thanks to the five gods’ protection.
Place the stone, representing the five mirrors, in the correct location.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the old document in my file. The door is closed fast. Himuro family crest. It probably unlocks the door, but it’s broken. There are several pieces of paper on the floor. Looks like part of a notebook.

[Black Notebook Scrap]
September 13th, 9:30 am
We found Ogata’s body. His head, hands and feet were strangled off... What happened to him is just like the strange deaths that occurred here long ago. There was a photo of Ogata near him. In it, there was something that looked like ropes on his neck, arms, and legs.
I wonder if it’ has anything to do with the Rope Shrine Maidens in the legends around here, the girls that had ropes tied to their neck, arms and legs, too...?
September 13th, 12:10 pm
Tomoe is acting strangely. She’s been mumbling nonsense all morning. Something about ropes... And mirrors... I can’t blame her for going to pieces, though, after seeing what happened to Ogata.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file. There are several pieces of paper on the floor. Looks like part of a notebook.

[Red Notebook Scrap]
September 10th, 8:00 pm
I clearly saw the image of a woman, in front of the mirror near the entrance. She had long hair and a white kimono. There were ropes tied to her arms and legs, and she dragged them along when she walked. I think I heard Koji talk about something like that, too.
There’s something VERY wrong about this mansion.

Miku Hinasaki: There is something at my feet... (Type 14 film) Something is reflecting light in the dark. (Sacred Water)

(Miku approach a locked door.)

Miku Hinasaki: There are buttons with characters. This device must open the door. There’s engraving underneath, but it’s gouged. Can only read some. I can just barely make out... "the Shinto ritual," "Strangling" and "held on the day of..." from the gouged out words.

(Miku solves the puzzle using the code 壱参壱弐 / 1-3-1-2 and enters the room.)

Miku Hinasaki: In the corner of the room is an old suit of armor. I found a partially burnt piece of paper on the shelf. Looks like an old news article.

[Old News Article]
The girl who has been missing for three days in the Himuro Mountain area, and rumored to have been snatched away by ghosts, has been found by a local man. She is fatigued, but in good health. The police plan to wait for her recovery and ask her about the other three children.
The girl’s parents have also been missing the day after her disappearance. The police is looking for a foster home for the girl.

Miku Hinasaki: I feel a powerful presence from the back of the room.

(She takes a photo of a ghost “Seductress” behind the stairs. Guarding talisman burns in flames.)

Miku Hinasaki: The strong ghostly sense has disappeared… There are several pieces of paper inside the box. Look like part of a very old diary.

[Old Diary Scrap]
May 20th 
We’ve finally gotten through the move to Himuro Mansion. I had a hard time cutting through all the red tape with the local officials. But, just as I’d hoped, the air is fresh here! It should be good for Yae in her poor health.
My daughter Mikoto seems to like this area, too. She’s made friends here already, and is enjoying herself. Yae seems to think this old mansion is spooky, but I plan some work on it. Make it easier for her to live in. (Once I get settled in my research.)
The best thing about living here is that I don’t have to go out to do my research. It’s all here in this mansion. I can be right by Yae’s side all of the time.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of an old diary in my file.

(Miku goes back to the door with talisman on it.)

Miku Hinasaki: No more talisman. The force that was holding the door shut is gone.

Ghost of Tomoe Hirasaka: Kirie… Kirie… What are you trying to say?

(Miku takes a shot of another door with talisman on it.)

Miku Hinasaki: Some other place shows in the photo… There are several pieces of paper on the floor. Looks like part of a notebook.

[Black Notebook Scrap]
September 13th, 3:00 pm
Tomoe’s condition is getting worse and worse. She can’t stop shaking, and she keeps mumbling the same words over and over. I don’t know if what’s happening is anything supernatural or not. But in any case, I think we’d better leave as soon as possible.
Tomoe is in such bad shape, she can’t even move. I guess I’ll have to look for a way out of here myself. Even if we waited for help, I doubt anyone would ever come looking for us…

Miku Hinasaki: There is an audio tape on the shrine staircase. An audio tape with red label. It’s labeled "Research 2".

[Red Tape 2]
Tomoe Hirasaka’s Voice: September 11th, 8:16 PM… We looked all over the mansion, but we still couldn’t find Koji. While true that this mansion is huge, I’m certain we would have found him by now… Could he have already left? He’s been saying something about “more ropes” since we took some photos yesterday.

Ghost of Tomoe Hirasaka: Mister Takamine… Save me…

(Miku touches Red Tape 3 and sees another vision from the past.)

Tomoe Hirasaka: Help… Mister Takamine! (rope marks appears on her arm and neck) Ah! (she sees the woman in white kimono) NO! (dies)

(We see Takamine standing nearby and watching... but did nothing to help Tomoe.)

Junsei Takamine: Oh…

[Red Tape 3]
Tomoe Hirasaka's Voice: September 12th, 9:00 AM… I found Koji. His death was just like the one in the mountain village. His hands and limbs were severed. I can’t believe what’s happening!

(Miku takes a photo of a garden lantern.)

Miku Hinasaki: The garden lantern in the photo is lit.

(Miku goes back to thee door with talisman. She hears a baby crying behind the door.)

Miku Hinasaki: No more talisman. The force that was holding the door shut is gone. The tatami matting has been removed. There’s a big hole in the floor. There’s a sliding screen. I can’t see the atrium. Many Japanese dolls on a red mat. They’re wearing beautiful kimonos. They look expensive.

Ghost of Tomoe Hirasaka: Kirie... Kirie…

Miku Hinasaki: A doll with long hair and a white kimono. It’s roped off with sacred ropes, worshiped. There are several pieces of paper on the shelf. They look like part of a red notebook.

[Red Notebook Scrap]
September 12th, 1:45 pm
My sixth sense is telling me some children are playing here. I can’t see them, but they keep calling to me. Are they playing tag? Or hide-and-seek, maybe? They might be the children in that photo.
September 12th, 4:30 pm
There were human heads in that room... so many of them! They were cut off by the Himuro family master... They were all trying to tell me something.
I never should have come here. I should have trusted that sixth sense of mine.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file.

(Miku takes a photo of a ghost “Child Onlooker”. The talisman burns in flames and the room fills with creepy laugh of children. Opening the sliding door a ghost of a little boy enters the room. He crawls across the floor.)

Ghost of a girl: Wait...! Wait...! (laugh)

(Miku defeat the ghost and moves on.)

Ghost of Jinsei Takamine: Tomoe… Kirie... Rope... Maiden…

Miku Hinasaki: There is something shiny on the floor… (she picks up a lighter) There’s a little bit of oil left inside. It has "J.TAKAMINE" engraved on the back. There are several pieces of paper on the floor. Looks like part of a notebook.

[Black Notebook Scrap]
September 14th, 10:00 am
That woman that Tomoe called "Kirie" looks just like the descriptions of the Rope Shrine Maiden in the legends. And there’s a strong resemblance, too, between the way Tomoe and Ogata died and the manner of the deaths in the folklore.
So that woman is the Rope Shrine Maiden, is she...?

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file. A mirror like the one at the entrance. Maybe the mirrors in this mansion mean something?

[Red Notebook Scrap]
The mirror is breaking... Smash! A broken mirror... People on the floor, all over the mansion. So many people. All those people! What are they running from? And then at the end, with such desperate looks on their faces...!
Something’s coming this way! From deep within the mansion... A coldness... It’s colder than anything I’ve ever felt! I don’t know anymore if this is a dream or real...

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file. There is something on the ground where the ghost stood. A red audio tape. Only a little bit of it has been used.

[Red Tape 4]
Tomoe Hirasaka's Voice: Since I met that girl, I’ve seen many strange visions. All the ghosts in the mansion howl and scream at me… I don’t think they’ll ever let me out of this mansion. I don’t even know how long I can hold onto my sanity. Anyway... I’m leaving this tape. If ever someone listens to this... Please tell me what has happened to me… still… I hope it’s just a dream…

Miku Hinasaki: There are several pieces of paper on the floor. Looks like part of a notebook.

[Red Notebook Scrap]
A little girl in a white kimono keeps pleading to me. I can’t keep my mind focused, but her voice rings in my head and won’t leave. But what does she want me to do for her? I can’t even get out of this mansion anymore…
Broken. Five pieces... The mirror...!
Tell Mr. Takamine... the way to break the curse…

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file. There are buttons with characters. This device must open the door. There’s engraving underneath, but it’s gouged. Can only read some. I can just barely make out... “maiden” “purifies” and “the chosen,” from the gouged-out words.]

(Miku goes back to the garden and light the lantern.)

Miku Hinasaki: I used the Lighter. There is something inside the top part of the garden lantern. (Black Carving) A stone with a strange character carved into it. The reverse side has a plug.

Woman’s Ghost: The children... Where have the children gone?

Miku Hinasaki: There’s a small piece of paper on the ground. Looks like a very old news article.

[Old News Article]
The girl, who has been found after three days of mysterious disappearance, has been adopted. Mr. Hinasaki, a close friend of Mr. Ryozo Munakata (also missing), will adopt the girl.
The girl’s parents were missing even after she returned, so the police was looking for a foster home or adoptive family. The girl does not remember anything from her disappearance, and the three other children are still missing.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the news article in my file. There’s a small door here, but it’s nailed shut. I can’t open it. There is an old book of rice paper on the ground. It’s written in charcoal ink.

[Research Scrap]
The Legend of The Holy Mirrors
(The Mirrors of the Five Gods)
The Holy Mirrors, held in five shrines in this region, are most commonly known as "the Mirrors of the Five Gods." The legend tells that the five gods, before leaving this land, created these mirrors as a means of protecting the village.
Some legends mention another mirror. The story is that all five mirrors were used together in a ritual to fend off a huge disaster (whether this was the Calamity or not is not known).
It is not known whether the ritual mentioned above is related in any way to the one performed by the Himuro family, but there is the correlation of the mirrors.
However, the actual existence of the legendary Holy Mirror, one complete mirror, has not been confirmed, and it is not known what the legend is based on.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the book describing the Himuro family in my file.

(Miku returns to the door lock on the combination lock, enters a code 参陸陸玖 / 3-6-6-9 and unlocks the door.)

Ghost of Jinsei Takamine: How do I lift the curse of the rope…? I must hurry... I’m beginning to show rope marks...

Voice from the Well: Help...!

Miku Hinasaki: An audio tape with a blue label. Looks like it’s half-used.

[Blue Tape 1]
Junsei Takamine’s Voice: September 12th, 3:20 PM… I know this sounds crazy, but there’s something here besides us in this mansion. I’ve seen it myself, it was a woman in a white kimono. Something is definitely happening here. Have we unknowingly awakened something? Or perhaps we’ve been lured here to die?

(Suddenly, a ghost appears in Miku’s way.)

Ghost: Tell… Tell him…

Miku Hinasaki: T-tell him what?

(Miku defeats the ghost.)

Ghost: We do not want to come… We have to tell him… The mirror! The mirror!

(Miku explore the cemetery and finds several more pages from the black diary near the tombstone.)

[Black Notebook Scrap]
September 14th, 8:00 pm
In the materials Tomoe gathered for me, there’s a paragraph about five pieces of mirror passed down through the Himuro family for generations. These pieces were said to seal off the Hell Gate and protect the region from a great disaster. They might, have something to do with the current hellish situation.
Five Holy Mirrors in shrines around the area all broke in a small earthquake the other day. When I it gave me the idea heard about it, for this next work of mine. I think I brought a news article about it with me when I came here. It says there were only five Holy Mirrors in existence.
But according to so e legends, there is another--the True Holy Mirror. The folklorist also mentions this in his research documents, the ones I found here in the mansion. (I think I dropped the research documents somewhere when I was trying to escape that cursed woman.)
Here are my theories I think that the five mirrors that were destroyed in the earthquake the other day had the role of "watching over" the True Holy Mirror. I don’t think it was the earthquake that broke the five Holy Mirrors in the shrines. I think it was a signal that the seal on the Hell Gate that the Himuro True Holy Mirror provides provides had broken for some reason. The five mirrors were trying to warn us.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of notebook in my file.

(She returns to the house. On the stairs, Miku sees a ghost talking to her.)

Ghost of Jinsei Takamine: The Rope Shrine Maiden… The curse… Just one more… Just one more Buddha statue, and the Holy Mirror will be…

(Miku comes to the door of the house, locked with a code lock.)

Miku Hinasaki: It reacted! Do I match the carvings to the characters, maybe...?

(She moves the stones on the lock and insert the Black Carving in it. Miku enters a dark room with a fiery pool of blood on the floor.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is an audio tape on the pedestal.

[She’s got the Blue Tape 2.]

Miku Hinasaki: There are four Buddha statues and some kind of pedestal in front of a small shrine.

Ghost: She’s the last Maiden… 

(Miku raises her head and sees the crucified ghost on the ceiling. He is held by a dead men’s hands. When they release the ghost, he falls on Miku, but dissolves in midair. She’s shocked. The room is filled with shadows. The sounds of suffering and pain. The crucified ghost hunts for Miku. She defeat him. The last photo she take shows something...)

Miku Hinasaki: Some Shinto gate somewhere shows in the photo. What could be at the Shinto gate...?

Crucified Ghost: The last Buddha statue is… at the Shinto gate…

(Miku searches under the gate.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is a hidden door at the base of the Shinto gate. There’s something inside it…

[She’s got Headless Buddha.]

Miku Hinasaki: The head is damaged and painted in red, like blood. There is something written on the paper the Buddha statue was wrapped in.

[Five Buddhas Document]
Bury the Rope Maiden’s spirit.
Place the five Buddha with her damaged limbs.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the old document in my file. There is a notebook on the staircase. Most of the pages have been torn out.

[Black Notebook Scrap]
I’m about to go to t e shrine deep within Himuro Mansion, where they say a piece of the True Holy Mirror is kept. The curse has already left its mark on my four limbs. There’s no escaping it. About the only thing left now that I can do is try go reseal the Hell Gate. It’s my last hope.
I’ve already found four of the Buddha statues I need to get a piece of the mirror. And I’ve managed to find an old document that tells of the location of the fifth statue.
"Make observance to the Buddha," At the base of the large gate, "So that the souls of the piteous maidens," Can reach up to the heavens."
If all goes well, no one will ever have to read these notes, and I can use them toward the content of my next book. In closing, I would like to thank my assistant and my partner, Tomoe Hirasaka.
If it weren’t for the words she left with me, I wouldn’t have been able to complete this, my final work. If I don’t return, please give her a decent burial. 
Signed, Junsei Takamine, September 15th.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the novelist’s death note in my file.

[Blue Tape 2]
Jinsei Takamine's Voice: Is she the one causing this disaster...? All of those earlier deaths…? Koji… Tomoe… All of them? I’m I the next to die? The Rope Shrine Maiden Ritual… as told of in legend… Both arms, legs and the neck. It is said then all five had been marked the curse is complete. Ropes are beginning to appear on my photo. I’m running out of time…

(Miku enters the dark room again.)

Miku Hinasaki: A row of four Buddhas. There’s space for another in the middle.

(She places the Headless Buddha.)

Miku Hinasaki: I put the Buddha Statue with the Damaged Head between the other four Buddha statues.

(The pedestal opened and revealed a three-by-three grid of holes.)

Miku Hinasaki: A row of Buddha statues appears above the row of hole of the pedestal.

(She places the statue in the correct order. A cabinet above the statues opens.)

Miku Hinasaki: Is this the Holy Mirror? It’s just a piece of it…

(She sees some fragments of memory about the ritual and how the Mirror got broken.)

Miku Hinasaki: Ah!

(The Rope Maiden is behind her back. Miku sees her refection in the mirror. But there is no one behind her back! The Maiden IS in the Mirror! She slowly enters the room, passing through the mirror. There is nowhere to run, the door is closed. The Maiden touches Miku’s hand and she sees her death, torn to pieces by ropes. Around her disfigured corpse are dancing children. After that Miku wakes up in another room of the house. She notices how someone runs out of the room, which resembles a child in height. She is terrified to notice the marks from the ropes on her wrists.)

Miku Hinasaki: The ropes...? No…

Demon Tag / 2nd Night
(Miku notices a boy ghost with a piece of Mirror in his hands.)

Miku Hinasaki: That mirror… Give it back!

(The boy dissolves into thin air. Miku looks around the room she finds herself in. She takes a photo of the wall.)

Miku Hinasaki: A scroll shows in the photo. It looks like it’s a picture of Demon Tag. I put the photo in my file.

[Mafuyu’s Note]
I must have been passed out. I’m afraid it’s too late to help Mr. Takamine... If only I had come to sooner! The spirits in this mansion are very powerful. The force behind this curse must be here somewhere... And I’m going to start looking for it right now!

Miku Hinasaki: I put Mafuyu’s note in my file. Mafuyu... Now I know you’re here somewhere. There is a diary written on old paper inside the pretty box.

[Lady’s Diary Scrap]
June 10th
Mikoto really seems to like this mansion. She’s playing Demon Tag here with her neighborhood friends again today. I guess a big mansion is the perfect place for kids to play. But for people in my sickly condition, it’s a little bit too big…
June 15th
Today was a wonderful day. My husband, my daughter and I took a walk in the mountains. I’m feeling pretty good these days, and I was even able to walk quite a distance today.
I had so much fun!

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of a woman’s diary in my file.

(She walks out of the room and notices a child running fast nearby. Soon Miku encounters the ghost of a blinded woman.)

Ghost of Blinded Woman: It’s dark… so dark… He knows I’m here… My eyes!

(Miku quickly defeats the ghost and continues to explore the house.)

[Blind Demon Ritual]
On the 26th day of the 11th month, in preparation for the Strangling Ritual 10 years later, choose a maiden with holy power.
She should be past the age of 7 years, 9 months, and 25 days.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the old document in my file.

(She explores the room.)

Miku Hinasaki: Box for mortuary tablet and bone remains. Candles are lit. Somebody must have been here. There are candles lined up in front of a small red box.

(She takes a picture of the puzzle lock on the door. The picture shows the location of the missing piece. )

Miku Hinasaki: Something shows in the photo…

(Miku goes to the place indicated in the picture. Along the way, she stumbles upon a creepy ghost--his long arms grasping the corner, and then slowly his head appears. Miku takes a few quick shots and the creepy ghost dissolves. She finds another place to take a photo.)

Miku Hinasaki: Some other place shows in the photo…

(She finds a door with a puzzle lock.)

Miku Hinasaki: There are buttons with characters. This device must open the door. There ’s engraving underneath, but it’s gouged. Can only read some. I can just barely make out… "the Shinto ritual, " "Blind..." and "held on the day of..." from the gouged-out words.

(She opens her notes and reads Blind Demon Ritual - thanks to it she learns the code 武陸爸爸. Opening the door, Miku walks down the narrow passageway that leads to the courtyard with the well. She struggles to push back the massive wooden lid and looks into the dark depths of the well. From the depths, the ghosts of children begin to climb out. Miku has no choice but to arm himself with a camera and fight for her life. The ghosts of children laughingly attack her. Soon Miku manages to defeat the ghosts. She examines the resulting pictures.)

Miku Hinasaki: Something shows in the photo…

(In one of the pictures she discovers a stone in the form of a blue polyhedron with a carved symbol in the center. It lies on the edge of the well.)

Miku Hinasaki: Like the photo, there is a blue stone atop the well.

(She picks up a strange rock.)

Blue Carving: A stone with a strange character carved into it. The reverse side has a plug.

(Miku continues to explore Himuro’s estate. After getting the blue stone, she manages to solve the riddle and open the door in a nearby house. As she walks out into the corridor, she notices her brother’s ghost leaving. There’s also a note on the floor.)

[Mafuyu’s Note]
The mansion has started to change. As far as I can figure out, the ghosts are trying to pull me back into the past. The spirits are using their power to make parts of the mansion revert to the way they were in the past. The ghosts of that era are beginning to stir.
Just what exactly happened in this mansion, anyway? And just what do the ghosts want me to do about it?

Miku Hinasaki: I put Mafuyu’s note in my file.

(She takes a picture of the closed door.)

Miku Hinasaki: Something shows in the photo…

(In the picture we see a pile of stones located somewhere near the water. That’s where something must be to open this door. Miku goes to the lake. On her way she encounters a strange ghost. A female ghost, instead of attacking her as usual, tries to talk to her.)

Ghost: My daughter... She was only playing Demon Tag…

(Miku finds a pile of rocks and picks up another carving.)

Purple Carving: A stone emitting a purple light is stuck in the top of the stone pile. A stone with a strange character carved into it. The reverse side has a plug.

(Miku returns to the closed door, taking pictures of several ghosts and solving another puzzle. When she opens the door she spots her brother again, but this time he looks more like a human than a ghost.)

Miku Hinasaki: It’s… it’s Mafuyu!

(Miku runs toward him. She descends several stairs into a small underground room and looks around.)

Miku Hinasaki: Horn-like rocks have been tied with sacred ropes. It looks like an altar. A huge door is in the way. It doesn’t seem to open. Maybe it’s locked?

(She notices a ghost standing right outside the door. The ghost quickly disappears. Miku hears a voice from the netherworld.)

Ghost: Beyond this door is the ritual’s...

(Miku photographs the place where the ghost stood and sees a small image of some kind of mask.)

Miku Hinasaki: A mask with stakes in it appears on the pillar next to the door.

(She’s looking at the very place she just photographed.)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s a place for hanging something. I wonder if it’s a device for opening this gate?

(On the left side of the door, Miku finds a notebook lying on the floor.)

[Research Scrap]
The Ritual Masks And Their Meaning
In the Himuro rituals, masks play a very important role. One of them is called the Blinding Mask, which is used in the Demon Tag Ritual. Two stakes pierce through the eyes of the Blinding Mask. It is used in the Demon Tag Ritual as a blindfold.
The legend goes, "While the demon is blindfolded, enter the rope altar and perform the ritual." This might mean that the Blinding Mask is a key to the rope altar.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the book describing the Himuro family in my file.

(Realizing that there’s nothing more to do here, Miku goes to the stairs. There she is attacked by the ghost of a woman.)

Ghost of a Woman: ...What’s why I’m here…

(After defeating the ghost, Miku sees several candles in one of the pictures, some of which are lit.)

Miku Hinasaki: Only the red candles in the photo are lit. There is a tiny matchbox where the ghost was.

[Matches]
Miku Hinasaki: It’s old, but the matches inside look usable.

(Miku goes to the main house to the altar on which several candles are lit. Using matches, she lights the red candles and extinguishes the white ones. The small box behind the candles opens.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is an old scroll inside the box.

Scroll: It’s a painting of Demon Tag. I’ve seen this before somewhere…

(While she was looking at the scroll, a ghost quietly sneaks up behind her. Miku notices this, turns around, and quickly pulls out her camera.)

Ghost: It’s dark here… My eyes!

(Miku manages to quickly deal with the ghost. She returns to the room with the dolls and, after defeating the ghost of the child who is crawling on the floor, she hears a voice.)

Ghost of a child: Come and play with me… I was waiting for so long… sooo long…

(She hangs the scroll on a nearby wall.)

Miku Hinasaki: When I hung up the Demon Tag Scroll, I heard an unlocking sound from the wall.

(She manages to open the secret door behind the scroll. Miku finds herself in a large room covered with robes, as if they were being dried after washing.)

Miku Hinasaki: An old kimono hangs here. It’s faded and dusty, but the red lining is still vivid.

(Miku begins to explore the new part of the mansion and collects scattered items. At one point she finds a room with stairs leading to the second floor. In this small room there is an antique tall floor clock. It begins to chime. Miku slowly walks closer to it. The doors at the bottom slowly creak open. Miku prepares to fight... as suddenly the ghost of a child runs out at her. He begins to move around the room as if playing with her.)

Ghost of a Child: Over here! Over here!

(Miku defeats the kid without much problems.)

Ghost of a Child: ...I have to give the Mirror to that man.

(Mick manages to retrieve the lost shard of the Mirror.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is something shiny where the child ghost stood. Took back the Holy Mirror. I wonder what this mirror means?

(She examines the clock and finds a scrap of paper there.)

[Child’s Writing]
Isn’t Mikoto ever going to come find me? We’re playing Demon Tag, and she’s supposed to be the "Demon" Did she quit, maybe? Hey, I wonder if Mikoto likes me? If she ever comes and finds me, maybe I’ll just ask her!

(Before going up to the second floor, Miku notices a ball bouncing down the stairs. The ball also appears to be ghostly and disappears as soon as it reaches the floor. Miku goes up to the second floor and examines a drawer to her left.)

Miku Hinasaki: I found a piece of an old diary in the drawer of the chest.

[Old Diary Scrap]
June 13th.
Mikoto found an odd camera. She said she found it in the mansion when she was playing Demon Tag. I tried asking her exactly where in the mansion, but she just keeps saying a girl in a white kimono gave it to her. I can’t find out any more about it.
June 14th 
I had a look at the camera Mikoto found yesterday, but I didn’t see anything special about it. It was probably left here some time ago by somebody that came to investigate the mansion.
June 15th.
The weather was wonderful today, and Yae seems to be feeling better. The three of us decided to take a walk in the mountains. Yae hadn’t been out in a long time, and she really seemed to enjoy it. She had fun with Mikoto’s camera, taking pictures with it all day long.

(Miku finds a sealed door and takes a picture of it.)

Miku Hinasaki: Some other place shows in the photo…

(She continues to explore the spooky house and finds a room with the floor slightly cracked.)

Miku Hinasaki: Cold air is flowing in through a big hole in the floor. Something fell through here…?

(She looks around and notices a wooden plaque on the wall with the same symbol she has already seen on the blue stone. She takes a picture of the plaque.)

Miku Hinasaki: A mask shows in the photo. It looks like the mask that used to hang here… I put the photo in my file.

(Miku enters a creepy corridor with scary ropes hanging from the ceiling that ends in a mirror. It was in this corridor that Mafuyu disappeared at the beginning of the game. Miku goes through the door to the left of the mirror. There she finds a long corridor of sliding doors, which begin to open on their own. Miku becomes uncomfortable. Behind the last door hides the ghost of a woman with long black hair and wearing a black dress. The ghost hangs upside down. Eerily turning on our heroine, the dead girl attacks. Defeating her proves to be a difficult task because the maneuvering space is severely limited, but Miku copes. She goes on and goes up to the second floor to the sealed door again. Next to the door, there’s a girl playing a biwa type instrument behind a window made of rice paper. As Miku gets closer the girl’s string breaks and she disappears.)

Miku Hinasaki: No more talisman. The force that was holding the door shut is gone.

(She walks into a room full of books and finds a diary on the table.)

Miku Hinasaki: There are several pieces of paper on the old desk.

[Mafuyu’s Note]
It looks like the ghosts of the women with the gouged-out eyes react strongly to sounds.
If I’m really quiet, I can get away without being noticed.

Miku Hinasaki: I put Mafuyu’s note in my file.

(She keeps wandering around the rooms filled with books.)

Ghost: Where is my daughter Mikoto?

Miku Hinasaki: There’s a small safe on the chest of drawers. There’s a small keyhole in its door.

(She takes a picture of the safe.)

Miku Hinasaki: A key shows in the photo.

(She examines the bookcase.)

Miku Hinasaki: Old books are kept here. It looks like he was studying about old religions. I found an old diary on the bookshelf.

[Old Diary Scrap]
June 2nd.
Since we moved to Himuro Mansion, my research is progressing even more quickly than I had hoped. The other day, I found some documents left by the last master of the Himuro line. They say he went on a murderous rampage, and then committed suicide…
This mansion is filled with tricky devices and mechanisms. And there seem to be some rooms that aren’t shown on the house plans... I’m absolutely certain there are many more documents hidden around the place somewhere.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of an old diary in my file.

[Old Diary Scrap]
June 18th
These past few days Yae has been taking pictures with Mikoto’s camera all over the mansion. I asked her what she was taking pictures of, but she just kept mumbling, "I can see them," as if she were delirious. She wouldn’t say anything else…
June 19th
Ever since the day we walked in the mountains Yae hasn’t been feeling very well.
Today she’s in bed and very ill.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of an old diary in my file.

(She continues to explore the house. Some time later, she stumbles upon a door again, closed with a strange lock with hieroglyphics.)

Miku Hinasaki: There are buttons with characters. This device must open the door. There’s engraving underneath, but it’s gouged. Can only read some. I can just barely make out… "...Shrine Maiden," "Demon..." and "chosen… age of… years… months" from the gouged-out words.

(She starts digging through her notes and finds the "Blind Demon Ritual.” She manages to find the right set of characters for the lock, 添改式伍, thanks to the numbers listed there.)

Miku Hinasaki: The door unlocked.

(The room turns out to be a storeroom. Next to the samurai armor mounted on the rack there is a long box. The lid on this box begins to move. Miku decides not to tempt fate and does not open the box. She gathers all the useful items and goes up the stairs to the mezzanine. It turns out to be empty there. Miku leaves the storeroom. When she goes up to the floor above she discovers that the seal on the door is damaged.)

Miku Hinasaki: No more talisman. The force that was holding the door shut is gone.

(She goes inside. There are several paper screens separating the room. On a bench and on the floor there are lots of pictures.)

Miku Hinasaki: These photos… they’re exactly the same as the ones mom took… Where were they taken with this camera?

(She examines the bench again.)

Miku Hinasaki: Ghost photos are scattered on the desk, just like the ones from my mother’s camera… There is an old piece of paper on the desk.

[Lady’s Diary Scrap]
June 24th
Mikoto is missing. She said she was only going to play Demon Tag here in the mansion. I don’t think she would have gone outside... She had that camera with her... None of Mikoto’s four friends have come home, either. It’s as if they’ve all been snatched up away by ghosts…
June 27th
It’s been three days since Mikoto was snatched away from us. Everything has been so strange! Ever since we moved to this mansion...
Ever since we got that camera... If I lost my sanity now, too, I wouldn’t have to think about it anymore. I could be free…
I can see them... I can see them now even without the camera…

Miku Hinasaki: I put the piece of a woman’s diary in my file.

(She examines the pillow on the floor…)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s a big koto here. It looks clean, as if it had been used recently.

(She examines the door…)

Miku Hinasaki: It won’t open no matter how hard I try. Maybe it’s broken.

(She examines the shelf under the drawing on the wall…)

Miku Hinasaki: Something on the floor is reflecting light. I picked a small key out of the dust. I got the bronze key.

(Suddenly the gramophone on the floor starts playing a record.)

Ghost: It can’t be… How can a camera expose something that doesn’t even exist?

(After getting the key, Miku goes to the small safe.)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s a bronze safe on the desk. A small keyhole is in the door.

(She opens the safe. Suddenly she sees a flashback to a folklorist who has moved into the mansion with his family…)

Folklorist: I came to research the Himuro Family secret ritual because… this blinding mask is the key to the door… the altar must be behind this door… 

(The Folklorist manages to open the door. The memory is interrupted.)

Miku Hinasaki: I found the folklorist’s research documents inside the safe.

[Research Scrap]
Mask of Reflection
The mask worn by the Himuro family master is called the "Mask of Reflection." The legend goes, "It can become the face of an angel or a demon," meaning its facial expression reflects the nature of the one who is wearing the mask.
Inside Himuro Mansion is the Mask Room, where all the masks used for the rituals are kept, and the Mask of Reflection serves as its key. The document mentioned that the mask, when worn by the master, turned into the face of a demon at the last ritual.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the book describing the Himuro family in my file.

(Opening the sliding door, Miku enters the balcony. She looks around the yard and notices a girl hanging from a tree in the distance. Miku remembers seeing a similar scene before - her mother hanged herself after using an antique camera to fight the ghosts attacking her. Miku watches the battle through a gap between the doors.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mom!

(Her mother turns around. The hanged woman’s frozen face is exactly the same as her mother’s.)

Miku Hinasaki: Why? What happened...?

(As she continues to look around the yard, Miku notices an item lying on the ground. She finds a way to get out into the yard and pick it up.)

Miku Hinasaki: The album I saw from the Moon Observatory is on the ground.

(She notices a ghost next to her, staring in wonder at the hanged woman.)

Ghost: Yae… How could this be?

(The heroine’s mother hanging from a tree begins to move.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mom…?

(His mother’s ghost opens his eyes and attacks. Miku has to fight for her life again. When she does manage to win, she notices something interesting in one of the pictures.)

Miku Hinasaki: A row of dolls shows in the ghost’s photo.

Ghost: Where’s my daughter go?

[Yae’s Death Note]
Dear Ryozo, It’s all my fault... It’s all because I let Mikoto let Mikoto use the camera that day! And now evil spirits have gone and taken her away from us... It’s all my fault. I’m sorry.

Miku Hinasaki: I put Yae Munakata’s death note in my file. I found some photos when I opened up the album. I put the three photos in my file.

(Miku returns to the room with the dolls.)

Miku Hinasaki: A doll that is covering her eyes appears in the middle of the row of dolls. Who is in front of the back…?

(She solves the puzzle by placing the dolls in the right order.)

Miku Hinasaki: One of the dolls came off of the stand. It looks like it’s covering its eyes. When I put the Kagome doll on the pedestal, the drawer opened slowly. There is a strange mask inside the drawer. It’s got an angry expression. I’ve seen this thing somewhere else, too…

(After finally getting the mask, Miku runs into the room with the broken floor.)

Miku Hinasaki: There used to be a mask hanging here...

(She hangs the mask on the symbol plaque and hears the sound of the lock opening. Now the wall on which the mask hangs turns into a door. Once inside, she removes the mask in the hope that she will still need it.)

Miku Hinasaki: A pillar with a mask hanging on it shows in the photo.

(Miku removes the masks from all the nearby doors and walks on. She encounters another friendly ghost.)

Ghost: The Blinding Mask must be somewhere in this mansion…

(Miku finds a small room with masks. In the center is a column with plaques on which you can hang your masks.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is an old book on the floor. It’s the folklorist’s research documents.

[Research Scrap]
The Masks And Their Significance In Rituals
The Binding Ritual and the Demon Tag Ritual are performed by the Himuro family master. The master wears a mask when he performs the ritual. This is probably to eliminate the maiden of all worldly connections.
All participants of the ritual are family members. Meaning, "The one who is sacrificed and the one who performs the sacrifice" may be directly related.
My theory is that the mask serves to eliminate the maiden’s attachment toward her family. Gouging out the eyes of the demon in the Blind Demon Ritual may have similar meaning.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the book describing the Himuro family in my file.

(Miku touches one of the masks hanging from the column and notices a sharp movement through the eyes of the mask hanging opposite her. She looks into the eye sockets of the mask and is struck again by a vision of the past. She sees a ritual being performed. On the floor sits a woman being held by several occultists. In the hands of one of the occultists wearing a demon mask there is a mask with needles in place of the eyes.)

Miku Hinasaki: What’s that?

(When the chanting ends, the occultist in a demon mask puts the mask on the woman’s face.)

Woman: My eyes! My eyes!

(The mask that Miku was holding on to with her hands shifts slightly. The spirits of the past seem to notice this and turn in her direction. Miku freaks out and jumps away.)

Miku Hinasaki: What was that...?

(Suddenly a ghost of a woman sneaks up on her from behind. She keeps poking around the room as if she had recently gone blind. After a long battle with her, Miku manages to win. She removes the last, fourth mask and moves on.)

Miku Hinasaki: There are several pieces of paper on the ground. It looks like a piece of a notebook.

[Mafuyu’s Note]
I felt some especially powerful energy off of that woman in the white kimono. I think she’s probably the one behind this mansion’s curse.
I have to appease her spirit somehow, before anyone else falls victim to this mansion!
I have to find out what exactly is keeping her drawn back to this world.
And why did she let me go when she had me, I wonder? Maybe that has something to do with it…

(Going out into the yard Miku finds another stone.)

[Gold Carving]
Miku Hinasaki: A stone with a strange character carved into it. The reverse side has a plug.

(With it she solves the riddle of the lock and opens the door to a large hall with an altar at the far end. On it she finds a white mask.)

Miku Hinasaki: I got the Mask of Reflection. I can’t describe its facial expression. It’s very strange.

(She is attacked by the ghost of a priest. He keeps muttering something, but his words are very hard to make out.)

Ghost: Yae… Start the ritual… 

(After defeating the priest, Miku explores the room.)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s a giant wooden carving of Buddha here. Its left foot is damaged.

(Miku uses the mask to open the locked door and because the white mask can take on any facial expression. She enters the room conducting the ritual.)

Miku Hinasaki: A pretty, paper-shade lamp is lit. The walls are glazed. The whole room looks beautiful.

(She approaches the altar at the far end of the hall.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is a mask, like an eye-mask, on top of the glazed altar. I got the Blinding Mask. There are huge stakes through the eyes. This mask is different from the others. Maybe it’s supposed to be you somewhere else?

(Miku leaves the room and sees a ghost.)

Ghost: It was a mistake to live in this mansion… 

(Miku returns to the pit where she recently found a massive stone door. She approaches the ledge in the wall to the right of the door. There is a slight cracking sound and after that... singing. Miku becomes very uncomfortable. She slowly turns around. There are a dozen ghost children standing behind her. They stretch their pale arms toward her. Suddenly the ghost of a woman without eyes appears in their place.)

Ghost: Why am I here...? My eyes!

(Miku has no trouble coping with the ghost as she has done more than a dozen times before. Afterwards, she returns to the ledge.)

Miku Hinasaki: Characters are engraved on the wall. A device for opening the door.

(She hangs up her mask. The door slowly opens. At that moment, Miku sees a vision from the past again.)

Man: The door is finally opening… 

(Hundreds of hands grab him and drag him inside. The man screams in fear. The door slams shut behind him. The vision ends. The door in front of Miku slowly opens... she steps inside and sees the man’s corpse. There is a grimace of horror on his face, and he is holding a shard of the Mirror in his hands.)

Miku Hinasaki: Oh… it’s another piece of the Mirror…

(She slowly reaches for the shard... and sees a new vision. A group of masked men attack the inhabitants of the mansion and apparently kill them. The vision ends. Miku slowly turns around again and sees Kirie behind her, who has the souls of other ghosts attached to her back. As Kirie blocks the exit, Miku rushes to run deep into the cold and dark cave. Soon she runs into a large number of ghosts blocking her path. There’s nowhere else to run. Kirie is near. She reaches out her hand toward her.)

The Calamity / 3rd Night
(Miku sees many scenes of brutal murders in the mansion by masked men. She wakes up next to a stone door.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mafuyu… 

(Miku’s feet are bound by ghostly ropes that then disappear.)

Miku Hinasaki: This place...? I’m pretty sure Mafuyu went through that door…

(She opens the stone door again and goes inside. After defeating several ghosts, she reaches the far side of the cave, which is blocked, but through a small gap she manages to see... her brother’s back.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mafuyu! Don’t you recognize me?

(Miku looks around.)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s something that looks like a scroll among the fallen rocks…

[The Calamity]
In the year 1837 on the 13th day of the 12th month -- The Strangling Ritual failed and caused the Calamity.
Malice escaped, and 1347 souls were lost.

Miku Hinasaki: I put the old document in my file.

(Miku comes out of the cave and sees the ghost of the girl who helped her recently. She points again at an item lying on the ground. As soon as Miku turns around to look at the item the girl disappears.)

Miku Hinasaki: Where the girl pointed, there’s a book that seems to belong to the folklorist.

[Research Scrap]
Moon Shrine
The small shrine in the atrium of Himuro Mansion is called the Moon Shrine. It enshrines the maidens who were sacrificed in rituals. Inside the Moon Shrine is an empty well called the Moon Well. The moonlight shines down to the bottom on the night of the ritual.
The Rope Shrine Maiden is supposed to purify her body with moonlight at the bottom of the well. The bottom of the well is connected to the basement, and only the Maiden uses this path to reach the basement.
According to the legend, the first Rope Maiden was buried in the Moon Shrine. However, no body or documents were found inside. I wonder where the first Rope Maiden has been enshrined…

(Miku leaves the cave. As she climbs the stairs out of the pit, she feels a small earthquake. She goes to the room with the altar in which she found the white mask.)

[Ceremonial Rope]
Miku Hinasaki: There are four of them altogether. Maybe they’re used for some ritual? There is an old scroll at the top of the staircase.

[Document On Binding]
Show the maiden no mercy.
Cast the rope on her limbs from right arm, then the other.
From the right foot, then the other.

(She places a ceremonial rope on each Buddha statue. The rope and traces of blood appear on the statues’ necks for a few seconds. The box on the altar at the far end of the hall opens.)

Miku Hinasaki: The altar door opened. There is something at the back of the altar.

[Teal Carving]
A stone with a strange character carved into it. The reverse side has a plug.

(When Miku picks up the stone, she sees a new vision. The two men run away from the masked killer. The masked man brutally kills them with his katana. Miku turns away from this horrific scene. After finishing off the dying men, the masked killer stares intently at Miku as if noticing her. In the end, it turns out that the ghost did notice Miku. He attacks her in reality. His katana attacks inflict very severe wounds, so Miku has to use all her skill and accumulated healing items. After defeating him, Miku goes to the courtyard and opens another door locked with a strange lock using a newly found stone. Inside she discovers a massive and ornate black cabinet inside which lies a book on a special stand.)

Miku Hinasaki: I found the folklorist’s research documents inside the cabinet.

[Research Scrap]
The Mystery of The Cabinet And The Moon Well
The Moon Well, inside the Moon Shrine, is hidden with a trick mechanism. The cabinet moves and opens up the entrance to the Moon Well when a certain routine has been performed, but I have no idea how this is done.
There is only a vague description of the trick device. "Acquire the symbols from the four rope pullers, and show the Himuro family master’s seal."
This must mean that opening the door requires the symbols carried by the four priests participating in the ceremony, and the Himuro family master’s seal. However, now that the family has ceased to exist, there is no way of knowing how to acquire either the symbols or the seal.

(Miku takes pictures of all four sides of the cabinet, which have panels with four buttons on them. Each of the pictures shows the place where the combination can be found.)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s a pedestal engraved with four Sanskrit characters here. I tried pushing the buttons, but they wouldn’t go in.

(The first place she finds is right in the yard.)

Ghost: Poor girl… It’s too bad but it must be sealed…

(Miku defeats the ghost and sees one of the characters she wants in the picture.)

Ghost: Shrine Maiden, huh? Her only purpose is to die.

Miku Hinasaki: A stone monument stands here. Maybe it’s some kind of tombstone?

[Priest’s Writings]
Kirie has been acting strangely ever since she met the young guest. I do not suppose she is attracted to him...? If she becomes too deeply involved with this world because of him, she may lose her potential as a proper Shrine Maiden. We will have to do something, and quickly.

(Miku then walks out onto the dock to a pile of rocks.)

Ghost: Kirie? Why’re you even come to this world? You only suffer!

(The ghost of the priest appears and Miku defeats him.)

[Priest’s Writings]
We followed the master’s orders and hid the guest. I told Kirie our guest had gone home. We will have to carry the body far, far away, so that Kirie never finds out. I felt sorry for the poor man, but what else could I do? We priests must protect the Rope Shrine Maiden at all costs.

(Next, Miku goes into the house.)

Ghost: Let the ritual begin… Bring along Kirie…

(Miku defeats the ghost.)

Ghost: We need to seal it before it’s too late! Hurry!

[Priest’s Writings]
The ritual failed. The mansion is filled with the Malice. And that Malice has made the master lose his sanity. Who would have thought this Calamity would happen...? It is all over now. There is no telling what will happen unless we find a way to close the gate before it opens completely!

(To get to the last, fourth symbol Miku will have to solve another riddle with a strange lock.)

Miku Hinasaki: There are buttons with characters. This device must open the door. There’s engraving underneath, but it’s gouged. Can only read some. I can just barely make out… "Malice," "souls" and "lost" from the gouged-out words.

(She reads the documents and finds the solution - 壱参肆漆)

Ghost: The ritual has failed… It’s aaall over!

(Miku defeats him.)

Ghost: We aaall dead!

[Priest’s Writings]
I believe now that the master’s decision was a poor one + Kirie has realized that we hid the guest.
Kirie is depressed and anxious. The day of the ritual is fast approaching. I hope and pray everything goes well…!

(After getting all the clues she needs, Miku returns to the room with the closet. She presses the buttons with the corresponding symbols in the right order, and then another panel comes up. Miku takes a picture of it.)

Miku Hinasaki: A red liquid appears out of the hole in the pedestal in front of the cabinet. Something has been taken out of the middle.

(Miku finds another door with a strange lock. She digs through the documents again and enters the right combination - 壱参壱弐. Inside, a storeroom is discovered with nothing more than a few useful items. Miku continues to explore the house and finds a dojo-like room.)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s a big pool of blood in the middle of the room. …!

Ghost: Kirie… The Strangling Ritual…

(Miku defeats the ghost.)

Ghost: The strand is tainted now…

Miku Hinasaki: There is something on the ground where the ghost stood. 

She takes the Master’s Seal.

Miku Hinasaki: I wonder if it belongs to that ghost…

(She goes back to the black closet.)

Miku Hinasaki: I inserted the Master’s Seal into the open hole.

(The closet pulls back, revealing a hole in the floor with a ladder. Miku examines it with a flashlight.)

Miku Hinasaki: Don’t here?

(She goes down the stairs. The cave turns out to be another altar. At the far end she finds a dead priest tied with a rope. Next to him lies a shard of the Mirror.)

Miku Hinasaki: A female mummy is enshrined in a hollowed rock here. The Holy Mirror is on a stone in front of the mummy. There’s a recess in the stone. Something was removed?

(She takes the shard.)

Miku Hinasaki: I have almost all of the pieces of the Holy Mirror!

(She sees a vision of the ritual... Kirie is stretched out by her arms. She suffers greatly. When the vision ends, the ghost of the murdered girl appears before Miku…)

Miku Hinasaki: No! Kirie...

(She tries to escape, but the doors are closed. Miku climbs the stairs. KIrie is chasing her. Suddenly Miku hears a bell ring... the very same girl’s ghost reaches out to her.)

Kirie: We need to hurry! Please! Please, make it stop! Stop me!

Kirie / Final Night
(Miku wakes up in the house. In front of her is still the little ghost girl who has helped her several times.)

Miku Hinasaki: Who… are you?

(The ghost is silent as usual and simply points to the musical instrument lying on the floor.)

[KotoSheet Music]
Miku Hinasaki: I picked up the koto sheet music. It’s an old song, but I think I can play it.

(Miku plays the tune. A door opens behind her. Miku goes to a gap in the walls of the house where she finds an observation slot in the wall. She looks through it and sees a ghost of Kirie crying.)

Kirie: I don’t want to die…

(Miku continues to explore the invisible part of the house, so to speak. She sees a ball roll out to her. Miku discovers a massive wooden cage in which she sees the ghost of young Kirie tied to the wall with ropes. The ghost smiles and disappears. Miku enters the cage.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is a piece of the Holy Mirror under the Shinto gate. It’s the fourth piece. One more piece, and the mirror is complete...

[Kirie’s Hairpin]
Miku Hinasaki: I got a beautiful golden hairpin. Maybe it was Kirie’s, that woman in the prison…?

(Miku has another vision. Still alive, Kirie meets someone who looks like Mafia. They hold hands and admire the beautiful Sakura tree.)

Miku Hinasaki: Kirie and… Mafuyu? No, it’s not him. Maybe it’s the man she loved when she was alive. There is an old diary, written in charcoal ink, where the Holy Mirror used to be.

[Kirie’s Diary]
While I was looking out the window today, I saw somebody walking in the garden: He didn’t notice me. He was just walking around leisurely gazing at the trees and hills.
I saw him again today, walking in the garden. He saw me once, too, and waved to me. I don’t know why, but my face got hot, and I ducked out of sight. When I told the chief priest about it, he was terribly surprised. He told me I wasn’t to look out the window again for a while.
The Strangling Ritual will be held soon. The master and the priests are performing their ablutions. And it looks like the whole family has gathered here at the mansion for the ritual. This mansion is usually so lonely... But for today, anyway, it’s bustling with life.
One of the priests was staring at me today! He looked so sad. I’m the Rope Shrine Maiden…
I have a very important obligation to fulfill…
But how can I perform my duty as the Shrine Maiden now, feeling the way I do? Now that I’ve found out the true joy of living?
And now that I’ve gone and gotten that poor man involved…?
Today is the day I get to walk outside. I was walking in the mansion’s atrium when he suddenly appeared from out of the guest room.
It’s the first time I’ve talked to an outsider since I came here. It was so much fun!
He came to see me. He let me out of the room, and we went outside. He taught me the names of all of the flowers.
Everything about this is so new to me! My face got hot again today. But I didn’t want to hide this time…
He came to see me again today. The chief priest said we mustn’t go out into the garden, so we just stayed in the room and talked.
He told me so many interesting things about the outside world. I feel so happy when I’m with him...! So very, very happy!
I walked in the garden with him today. How beautiful the cherry blossoms are!
He’s taught me so much since we’ve met. I never even feel lonely anymore.

Miku Hinasaki: I wonder if Kirie used to read these books when she was trapped here? Over and over…

(She comes out of the wooden cage.)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s a big mirror. Maybe all the mansion’s mirrors have some ritualistic meaning?

(As she walks a little ahead, Kirie emerges from the mirror. Miku runs as fast as she can. She runs into a small room. When Miku touches the doll lying on the shelf the pursuit suddenly stops.)

Miku Hinasaki: There’s an old Japanese doll here. Its kimono is all faded. Funny, no dust, though… It looks like there is a diary in front of the doll.

[Kirie’s Diary]
It’s been five days already. since he stopped coming When I asked about it, the chief priest told me he’d gone back to his home village. Why would he leave all of a sudden like that...? Especially now, when I soon won’t be able to see him anymore at all…?
I had a dream about him.
He was looking at me with sad eyes. Such sad eyes! His eyes looked like they wanted to tell me something...
He didn’t go home. The priests did something to him... But why?
The priests hid him because they thought I wouldn’t have been able to properly be the Shrine Maiden otherwise... What did I get him into…?
It’s all my fault!
I just wanted to be with him...
I wanted us to be together forever and ever!
That’s all I wanted... I didn’t want him to get hurt!

(Miku continues to explore the house.)

[Priest’s Manual]
The gate is the entrance to the land of the dead. It has been feared and revered since ancient times. If the gate’s seal fails, the Calamity will occur, and the Malice will pour out from hell.
The souls of those touched by the Malice are bound to this world and cannot be saved.
We must prevent the Calamity at all cost. That is the duty of the Himuro family.
No document records the history of the gate in the mansion’s basement. The Himuros have been given the duty of protecting the gate. They built a shrine on this land and performed the "Rope Ritual."
We must prevent the Calamity at all cost. That is the duty of the Himuro family.
The mirror, blessed with the five gods’ protection, repels disaster. When the gate opens, stand before the "mirror rock, which is in front of the gate, and point the mirror at the gate, then seal it with the maiden’s rope. All elements mentioned above must be present for the ritual to succeed.
We must prevent the Calamity at all cost. That is the god-given duty of the Himuro family.

(Miku goes back down into the cave under the black closet. She uses Kirie’s hairpin and opens the locked door. She descends deeper and sees a vision again. A crowd of people follow the same route as Miku. They are priests. They are chanting spells. Two of the priests are in front and are holding Kirie. Leading the procession is a priest wearing a demon mask.)

Kirie: I want to see you one more time!

(Miku has to fight several spirits in the cave, after which she finds a massive door and a diary next to it.)

Miku Hinasaki: There is a note on the ground with a rock on top of it.

[Mafuyu’s Note]
Dear Miku,
I know it’s weird, but I see you sometimes here in the mansion. I run after you, but I always end up losing sight of you... There must be some kind of warp in time here now. We’ll probably never be able to find each other... Were you worried about me? Is that why you came?
I hope you get this note. I need you to help me. The force behind the curse of Himuro Mansion is a woman named Kirie. She was sacrificed in a ritual, and her sad spirit was exposed to the Malice that spilled out of hell when the Calamity happened.
Now she’s a miserable creature that taints everything she comes into contact with. Apparently, I remind her of the man she was in love with. I somehow just knew that when she touched me... I plan on going to see her now. If I don’t, this mansion will keep right on claiming victims…
Kirie laments her ill-fated life but, at the same time, she also regrets not having been able to fulfill her duty as the Shrine Maiden. I saw the image of Kirie as a child. She was looking for somebody to help her to help her other, tortured self.
Kirie is like a person divided in two...
Miku, I want you to help Kirie if you can. You have to seal off the Hell Gate with the Holy Mirror…

(Miku fearlessly enters the ritual room. She sees a vision of Kirie agonizing on the altar, stretched by ropes in different directions. The priests chant their spells monotonically. Suddenly everything comes to a standstill. In the silence, we hear a quiet voice.)

Miku Hinasaki: Stop… No! No… no…

(Kirie dies in terrible agony. A priest in a demon mask lifts up the one rope that killed her. Miku defeats the ghost in the room and examines the altar.)

Miku Hinasaki: Probably the altar where the ritual was done... A huge stone pedestal is stained red.

(Miku goes out the second door in the room and walks through the rows of red gates that are put up in Japanese temples. Ropes hang from some of them. At the end of the passage next to the door, she finds another diary.)

[Mafuyu’s Note]
I’ve been thinking about the camera Mom left us. I know it was Mom’s, and she left it to us when she died. But it used to belong to Grandma Mikoto. They say it was the only thing Grandma brought with her when she was adopted by the Hinasaki family.
In some documents I found here in the mansion, there were notes about a little girl named "Mikoto"--the same name as our grandmother--finding a camera with an uncanny power. And then I found out that Mikoto’s mother, the folklorist’s wife, died the very same way Mom did.
Mom was no match for the ghostly power of that camera. It drove her mad, and she had to leave this world. Now, if that camera is the same one Mikoto’s mother had...! Anyway, I don’t know all the specifics, but I’m pretty sure that camera is strongly connected to the curse on this mansion.

(Miku walks through the door and into a cave. There she is struck again by a vision. Several priests use ropes to seal the massive door. The other priests continue to recite the spell. Master of the house in a demon mask observes the whole process. However... the ropes break. A small earthquake occurs and the door begins to slowly open. The sacred Mirror cracks into five pieces. Himuro’s mansion is damaged by the earthquake. Everyone inside it is dead. Every corridor, every pathway is littered with corpses. The Master of the house kills everyone. Miku approaches the massive door and examines it.)

Miku Hinasaki: It’s the Malice...! I can’t go any further…

(She approaches a small stone monument with a symbol surrounded by ropes. She sees a vision. Her brother stands next to her.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mafuyu!

(Someone’s female arms gently embrace Mafuyu’s chest. Miku sighs in horror. It’s Kirie. She laughs eerily.)

Mafuyu Hinasaki: Miku…

(He reaches out his hand to her.)

Kirie: Leave her… we always be together!

(She... consumes him, turning him into her lover. Miku screams, but then gathers her strength. It’s time to deal with this creepy ghost once and for all. Periodic earthquakes make it impossible to focus the camera. On top of that, Kirie is the most powerful ghost and Mick has to use all of his camera skills to inflict tangible damage on it. After a few minutes of intense battle, she manages to win. The camera in her hands glows and explodes. Miku falls unconscious to the cold stone floor. When she comes to, she realizes that the camera has been destroyed, but not all the ghosts have been defeated.  Next to her appears Kirie’s lover, who she turned her brother into. Miku crawls back in terror... and then she hears the familiar ringing of a bell. The little girl’s ghost points her to a broken camera. Inside is a piece of the Mirror. Apparently it was the shard that allowed the camera to deal damage to the ghosts.)

Miku Hinasaki: It’s the last piece of the Mirror…

(She runs to it and picks it up.)

Miku Hinasaki: Now I have all the pieces! When I put the five pieces together the mirror began to emit a strange light…

(She approaches the monument.)

Miku Hinasaki: The rock has a recess in the center. It’s about the size of the Holy Mirror!

(She inserts a mirror into the hole and sees her reflection in it. From the door, hands reach out to her, but when she turns around, the hands melt and disappear. Mafuyu and Kirie appear in their place.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mafuyu? Thank goodness…

(Kirie looks at his hands in bewilderment. There is not a trace of rope on them. The little ghost girl, who appears to be Kirie’s tortured half, jingles her bell. She is, as always, pointing her finger at something important.)

Ghost Miku Hinasaki: Don’t forget your duty…

(She disappears. Kirie uses some mystical powers and closes the massive door.)

Kirie: Ugh… My duty is to keep this gate closed…

(She uses telekinesis to pick up the two ends of the torn rope that covered the doorway and ties her hands to the ropes. Something tries to get out, but she won’t let it.)

Kirie: Leave this gate to me… the rest of you… hurry and escape!

Mafuyu Hinasaki: But what about you?

Kirie: I must stop the Calamity… or else it’ll all happen again! Don’t worry about me… you must go…

(An earthquake begins to destroy the cave.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mafuyu! Come on!

Mafuyu Hinasaki: Miku… I must stay!

Miku Hinasaki: What are you saying!?

Mafuyu Hinasaki: I think I can help her… Miku, you go on without me.

(A huge boulder separates them.)

Mafuyu Hinasaki: (offscreen) Miku… the whole time Kirie was guiding me. I could hear her screaming… Screaming for help. As the Rope Shrine Maiden, she was destined to seal the gate. Yet she also wanted to be with the one she loved… but she couldn’t have both, and was being torn apart by those two feelings… which resulted in the Calamity. Her spirit was touched by the Malice and she became the creature that wanted others to suffer as she had. Now free of the Malice she’s about to fulfill her duties as Rope Shrine Maiden. Her soul must remain here, keeping this gate sealed off for all eternity. All alone… Endless pain… as long as she’s free of pain… as long as she’s not left hopeless… I wish to be by her side… Miku…

(Miku wakes up at the entrance to the mansion. She lies on the cold ground.)

Miku Hinasaki: Mafuyu…

(She sees many blue balloons representing souls rising into the air.)

Miku Hinasaki: Look! Their souls are all going back to where they belong…

Mafuyu Hinasaki: (offscreen) Miku… I now realize why I was brought here. And I will accept this destiny of mine… Miku… thank you for everything.

Miku Hinasaki: (offscreen) Ever since that day I stopped seeing things that other people don’t see...
