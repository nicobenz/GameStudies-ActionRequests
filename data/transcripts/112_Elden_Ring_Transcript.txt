[Under the sound of solid objects hitting, also similar to a heartbeat, we hear the narrator's male voice. A beautiful tall woman in a long black dress strikes the anvil with a scepter.]

Narrator: The fallen leaves tell a story. The great Elden Ring was shattered. In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between. 

[We see the beautiful tall woman up close. On her head is a graceful crown. In the next scene several men in black robes and hoods are killing a sturdily built man.]

Narrator: Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found, and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was first to perish. 

[Marika's relatives appear on the screen - a small, long-haired girl in a big blue hat and a long blue robe. A four-armed giant fighting armored soldiers and stabbing the red-haired giant with his staff. A creepy necromancer with a trident and a skull in his hands. A dead priest wrapped in a huge snake.]

Narrator: Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering. 

[We see an ancient battlefield. A red-haired woman wearing a helmet with wings and a long sword is fighting a giant.]

Narrator: A war from which no lord arose. A war leading to abandonment by the Greater War. 

[We see a giant crypt in which the corpse of our protagonist lies on a piece of cloth. The narrator's voice becomes louder and deeper.]

Narrator: Arise now, ye Tarnished. Ye dead, who yet live. The call of long lost grace speaks to us all. 

[We see a giant crucified on a tree and pierced with spears. Next to him hangs the head of a huge gray lion.]

Narrator: Hoarah Loux, chieftain of the badlands. 

[We see a dead man lying on the floor, wearing rags and a golden mask.]

Narrator: The ever-brilliant Goldmask. 

[We see a beautiful woman lying with a corpse surrounded by skulls.]

Narrator: Fia, the Deathbed Companion. 

[We see a fat giant hanging from a gallows with sores on his belly. The people rejoice at his death.]

Narrator: The loathsome Dung Eater. 

[We see a body lying in the grave with a book in his hands. On the head of the corpse we see a distinctive helmet with a narrow opening and a crown.]

Narrator: And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing. 

[The narrator stops talking for a minute. A tiny ball of grace flies to your hand.]

Narrator: And one other. Whom grace would again bless. A Tarnished of no renown. Cross the fog, to the Lands Between, to stand before the Elden Ring. And become the Elden Lord. 

[You awaken and explore your crypt. Soon you encounter a very powerful enemy named Grafted Scion. This multi-armed creature is very agile and fast, and easily defeats you. The floor beneath you collapses and you fall into a kind of sewer while he lies in the water, a girl rides up to you on a horse.]

Girl: Don't worry Torrent, fortune is on his side. We found him here, after all. One of his kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring. …Even if it does violate the Golden Order… 

[You awaken and discover that the girl left you a Flask of Crimson Tears and a Flask of Cerulean Tears which can restore your health and mana, but the amount of liquid in them is limited. Not far away you see a chasm and a ghost sitting in a chair next to it.]

Ghost: Brave Tarnished. Take the plunge. Recall the arts of war. And your warrior's blood. 

[You bravely jump into the abyss. After encountering a few simple zombie enemies, you become a bit more proficient with weapons. Walking a path full of enemies and traps, you encounter a Soldier Godrick. After defeating him and taking the elevator, you leave the crypt and enter a vast world with a glowing golden tree in the distance. You notice a man in a white mask standing on a hill and approaches him.]

WEST LIMGRAVE
Varré: Oh, yes… Tarnished, are we? Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm? Of course you have. No shame in it. Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless. Without guidance, without the strength of runes, and without an invitation to the Roundtable Hold… You are fated, it seems to die in obscurity. Luckily for you, however, there is one shining ray of hope for even the maidenless. Me. Varré. Take care to listen. Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished. That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel. Mm, indeed. Grace's guidance holds the answers. It will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow. Even if it leads you to your grave. Grace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly. To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff. The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted. It's time you set off, I should think. To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you. If you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are.

[After a conversation with a strange man, you finally find your purpose. You walk toward the castle and along the way stumble upon a dilapidated church. There you find a wandering man and his donkey. The man is resting by the campfire after a hard journey.]

Merchant: You're a Tarnished, I can see it. And I can also see… That you're not after my throat. Then why not purchase a little something? I am Kalé. Purveyor of fine goods. I am of a nomadic people. The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring. Let's say you're a very welcome customer. 

[You decides to spend some runes and buy some goods out of pity for the skinny merchant in rags.]

Kalé: Good-bye. Nice to do business.

[You continue to move toward the castle. On the way you come across Godrick's garrison of soldiers, clearly unwilling to let you pass, so you act cunningly and carefully, killing the soldiers one by one. After a tiresome battle you sit down to take a break by the site of grace when suddenly a girl in a cape with a tattoo on her right eye approaches…]

Girl: Greetings. Traveller from beyond the Fog. I am Melina. I offer you an accord. Have you heard of the Finger Maidens? They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished. But you, I am afraid, are maidenless. I can play the role of maiden. To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring. You need only take me with you. To the foot of the Erdtree.

[Unsure of your choice, you nevertheless agree to accept Melina's help.]

Melina: Then it's settled. Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength. Ahh, another matter. I bequeath to you this ring. Use it to traverse great distances. It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent. Torrent has chosen you. 

[You decide to test her abilities.]

Melina: Shall I turn your runes to strength? Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. Share them with me… your thoughts… your ambitions…

[After the ritual, you feel a rush of new strength and energy! After summoning your horse, you rush off and explore the surrounding countryside, battle rebellious skeletons, and soon find another wandering merchant under the bridge.]

Merchant: What do you need? I don't want any trouble.

[You buys several items.]

Merchant: All done? Well, be on your way, then.

[By nightfall, you return to the dilapidated church where he met Kalé and finds a stunted witch wearing a huge witch's hat. The girl sits on a rubble wall.]

Witch: This way, Tarnished. May I have a word?

[Not trusting the guest for a second, you nevertheless decide to approach her.]

Witch: A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished. I am the witch Renna. I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed. And upon looking into the matter, the talk, I surmise, is of thee. Thou'rt possessed of the power, no? To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent. 

[You decide not to lie and tell the witch that he owns a horse.]

Renna: Ah. As I had hoped. I was entrusted this, for thee. By Torrent’s former master.

[She gave you a Spirit Calling Bell and Lone Wolf Ashes.]

Renna: Tis a bell for calling forth spirits. Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree. The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past. Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest. Forgive mine intrusion, Tarnished. I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the Lands Between. How long will it be, I wonder… Before the Tarnished tire of obeisance to the Two Fingers?

[The witch dissolves in the thin air leaving just a gleaming trace. You return to Kalé.]

Kalé: Wait, weren't you…? Well, you're back. Care to buy something?

[You buy some stuff.]

Kalé: Good-bye for now.

[Having waited out the night in a ruined church, you continue on your journey. You even manage to kill the dreaded Tree Sentinel, after which you set out to explore the catacombs to the north. At the entrance he sees a ghost sitting on a chair.]

Ghost: …A proper death means returning to the Erdtree. Have patience. Until the time comes… and the roots call to you.

[After passing through the underworld and defeating the Erdtree Burial Watchdog you receive a Noble Sorcerer Ashes and continue your journey towards Stormveil Castle. The road turns out to be quite difficult. Many mighty enemies do not leave attempts to kill you and only a frisky horse allows you to avoid danger. On your way to the castle you come across a ruined hut, where you find a girl lying on the ground.]

Girl: Everyone's… been grafted. Everyone who came with me. They crossed the sea for me. They fought, for me. Heh… Only to have their arms taken. Their legs taken. Even their heads… taken. Taken and stuck to the spider. Did you know? If you’re grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid. It's quite the lark, when you think about it. You're all on your own, are you? And heading to Stormveil Castle? Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose. Oh, you've come to be one with the spider? Well, that makes us two peas in a pod. But I don't have your courage. It's scary, you know. Having your arms cut off. Or legs. Or your head. I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just too scared. I'm nothing but a craven. Oh, I know. Can you take this little one along with you?

[She gives you a Spirit Jellyfish Ashes.]

Girl: The poor thing deserves someone braver than myself… And the spirits look rather fondly upon you. It’ll be glad of your company, I think, the little’un. It was a pleasure to see you. Oh, can you pass on a message for me, if you see the little chrysalids in Stormveil Castle? Tell them I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I’m sure I’ll be joining their club soon enough. I'm finally getting the hang of this whole “pain” thing, you know.

[On the next site of grace you decide to talk to Melina.]

Melina: This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree. This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren. But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear. You can see them, can't you? The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden. Upon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer. A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring. If the rays of grace signal the castle, then the Elden Ring beckons you. As an ally by pact, …I pray that you are fit… To face the challenge presented by the Ring.

[On the way to the castle you stumble upon a dilapidated bridge by which sits an old woman in a suit resembling the clothes of the Pope. This woman is old in autumn and leaning on a thin staff. Also… the eyes in her eye sockets are missing.]

Old Blind Woman: You, please, I can read them. Your fingers, please, your fingers…

[You show the strange old woman your hand.]

Old Blind Woman: Oh, bless you. Oh… ohh! Head to the foundation of gold, Tarnished… Traverse Raya Lucaria; 'Glintstone Eventide'… …and reunite the half crescents, at the Grand Lift. Oh, but the bridge is collapsed, and cannot be crossed. Only, why should that matter! Stormveil Castle still stands tall!

[Continuing on your way and making his way through crowds of enemies, you find a narrow tunnel leading to the main gate of the castle. You sit down at a site of grace to catch your breath. Melina appears.]

Melina: Me? I'm searching. For my purpose, given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree, long ago. For the reason that I yet live, burned and bodiless. There is something for which I must apologise. I've acted the Finger Maiden, yet can offer no guidance. I am no maiden. My purpose… was long ago lost.

[As you walk through the tunnel, you notice a glowing golden sign and activate it, summoning the Sorcerer Rogier, and, as it turns out, you did everything right, because further awaits him a terrible enemy!]

Voice: Foul Tarnished. In search of the Elden Ring.

[In the distance, a deformed man of enormous proportions appears in a golden shine, holding a crooked staff in his hand, as crooked as he is.]

Deformed Giant: Emboldened by the flame of ambition. Hrah!

[He jumps and lands near you.]

Deformed Giant: Someone must extinguish thy flame. Let it be Margit the Fell!

[The horrific battle, sung in YouTube legends, begins. Margit is fast, agile, and deadly. He throws magical golden knives and deftly wields his staff. When you manage to inflict tangible damage, Margit pulls out a huge golden hammer…]

Margit the Fell Omen: Well, thou art of passing skill. Warrior blood must truly run in thy veins, Tarnished.

[After the exhausting battle you manage to defeat the giant. Margit falls on his knees and dissolves into golden dust.]

Margit the Fell Omen: I shall remember thee, Tarnished. Smould'ring with thy meagre flame. Cower in fear. Of the night. The hands of the Fell Omen shall brook thee no quarter.

[You decide to take a little break and sit near the site of grace. Melina appears.]

Melina: Forgive me. I've been… testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. And… whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded. Torrent had your measure from the very start. Whereas I merely pretended. There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance. I can take you to the Roundtable Hold… Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace… 

[You decide to go to the Roundtable Hold.]

Melina: Very well. Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.

[She teleports you to a certain room in a huge castle. In the center of the room is a round table with many swords stuck in it. Above the swords shines a golden glow of grace. You look around a bit and meet a man in armor, who personally reminds me of Ezio Auditore da Firenze.]

Armored Man: Ah, hello. You must be new here. I’m… Well, just call me Diallos. The honor of one's house holds little import in these lands. By the way, have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels? She's my servant, but fickle as the wind. Take your eyes off her for but a moment and she's good as gone. If you find her, please be sure to tell me. Be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman named Lanya. She's a servant to my house. She's been my companion since childhood. I've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this. Honestly, she's such a little tomboy.

[In one of the ornate rooms, you find a woman sitting on a bed. She is wearing a very loose black dress. It is Fia from the opening.]

Fia: Greetings, great champion called by grace. I am Fia. Circumstances have compelled my stay at the Roundtable Hold. Great champion, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly? Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigour, and your stout-heartedness. Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion. And you, I’m sure, will wear a baldachin’s blessing. Do you think it vulgar, perhaps? Where I come from, it is a sacred act.

[You reluctantly grant her wish.]

Fia: Ah, my thanks, great champion. (hugs the hero) You are… very warm… 

[You receives Baldachin’s Blessing.]

Fia: What you felt light up inside you was a baldachin's blessing. Though it is but a fleeting thing, I am afraid. Come back to me, should you require another. I will take you in my arms as often as you need.

[You decide to talk to Fia again.]

Fia: I am pleased to see you again. Would you like me to hold you, once more? The blessing is still aflame in your breast, dear. Would you like to be held, regardless?

[You willingly grant her wish.]

Fia: Now, come closer… (hugs the hero) You are so… very warm… I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from. After I received the warmth and lifely vigour from a number of champions, I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life. To do so is the purpose of my being. But before I could bear the noble into new life, I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace. Pray, be kind. Despite all that, I still wish to be a Deathbed Companion. So please, let me hold you like this, as often as it takes. Then good day to you, my dear.

[Leaving Fia’s chamber you find a blacksmith. A tall, skinny old man, covered in something like mushrooms, was tirelessly forging a sword on his anvil.]

Blacksmith: You're a new face. No matter, it's all the same. Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.

[You upgrade your weapons.]

Blacksmith: I see you've noticed the chains. Nothing special. I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains. I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools. (soft laugh) That's all there is to it. Nah, don't read too much into it. I've no grudge against you. My being a prisoner is no fault of yours. Besides, I don't mind smithing. Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same. Given time, technique never fail. Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her…

[You find an old man in Overlord’s helmet. It is Gideon The All-Knowing as we can learn from the opening of the game.]

Gideon The All-Knowing: Oh, this is a rare occasion. I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable. Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome. It is safe here. You may let down your guard. Allow me a word of advice, as your senior. You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more. A house guest, yet to earn their keep. Remember your place, newcomer. There's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure.

[You walk to a strange blind man with a wheel on his neck.]

Wheel Man: Oh, I see you've just arrived. Welcome to the Roundtable Hold. I'm Corhyn, a man of the cloth. I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the Two Fingers, and explore the secrets of the Golden Order. So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them, ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men. By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace.

[You nod.]

Corhyn: You do! Wonderful news. Most Tarnished are blind to it these days. You are something of a rare breed. Well, what do you say? Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers?

[You learn some incantations.]

Corhyn: May the Golden Order shine through you.

[You return to Limgrave and continue to explore it. In a narrow ravine, someone invades your world… An assassin with two thousand daggers named Nerijus. He attacks you without a word. Soon you hear a voice from somewhere above.]

Bloody Finger Hunter Yura: If it isn't Nerijus. The Bloody Finger. The end is nigh. For you, and your cessblood.

[Yura helps you defeat Nerijus and then vanishes into the thin air. You explore the nearby cave called Murkwater Cave. After passing several traps, you find a chest by the fire.]

Voice: Well well, well? Thought you’d just help yourself to a man's personal belongings? You scheming little thief! The gods demand repentance! Cough up your coin, all of it!

[A bald bandit called Patches attacks you. But… feeling a couple of inches of cold steel in his ass quickly surrenders.]

Patches: Wait, wait, please! I surrender! White flag and all! For Pete's sake! I concede! No one likes a bull-headed brute, you know! I yield, yield! You can’t harm a yielding man! Well, finally come around have you? I knew you would. You're a man of reason, through-and-through. Ha ha ha… Ahhh… Well, what do you know? You're Tarnished, like me. Now, how did I get that wrong? I took you for a demi-human, or some such. An innocent mistake, I assure you. Well, water under the bridge. Now we're squared up, how about we play nice from now on?

[You decide to forgive the bald sneaky fool.]

Patches: A true man of reason. Just what I like about you. I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered. Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say. Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits they're paying for my gruel. In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes. But honestly… this looting racket is bloody terrifying. Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop. So, don't be a stranger, eh? I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time. Ha ha ha… Don't forget to pop back for another visit, friend. I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.

Stormveil Castle 2
[After that you return to Stormveil Castle and continue to explore it. The gate is blocked further on, but he finds a way around the area and soon finds a tall, skinny man.]

Skinny Man: You there. Come over here, would you? You're Tarnished, aren't you? I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle. It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands. (stutter) Try the opening right here. The guards don't know about it. You'll breach the castle undetected. (smirk)

[You decide to follow the advice of the strange man.]

Skinny Man: Yes, that's the spirit. …You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like. I pray for your success.

[You begin to explore the surroundings of the castle. Most of the doors are closed… except one. Once inside, the door slams shut and a sly chuckle is heard from outside. Out of the darkness, a knight in armor emerges on you. After a difficult fight in the darkness you find a Rusty Key in the room and, with its help, opens the door leading to the stairs to the castle itself. Then you have a difficult journey through knights, hawks, giants, an army of crossbowmen to get to Godrick. On your way you find a small abandoned chapel. At the altar stands the sorcerer, already familiar to you.]

Sorcerer Rogier: Ah, nice to meet you. The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed. I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle. When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is. But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle? This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting. Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind…

[You told Rogier your goal - to defeat Godrick.]

Sorcerer Rogier: I see. Here to challenge Godrick, and lay your hands upon a Great Rune, are you? You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace. Well, enjoy it while you can. I'm Tarnished, like you. But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time. Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between. I'm privy to a few magical battle arts. Would you care to learn one? As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace. I'd love to help you out, if it please.

[Deciding to prepare before the decisive battle, you leave the castle. In your wanderings you stumble upon Waypoint Ruins and descend into the catacombs, where you have to fight Mad Pumpkin Head. Having triumphed, you see a strange door. Opening it leads you to a secret magical laboratory. A scholarly sorceress, whose face is hidden behind a stone mask, greets you.]

Sorceress: Tarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here. I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly. Why are you here?

[You answer that you want to learn sorcery.]

Sorceress Sellen: Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries? I dare say your proclivities are far from ideal… Oh well, perhaps nurture will defy nature. With a bit of luck. But one must choose one's masters wisely. I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria, as a reviled, apostate witch. Do you still wish to learn from me?

[You nod.]

Sorceress Sellen: (laughs) Well, you are a piece of work. Very well. You are now my protégé in glintstone sorcery. But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never. Anticipate grievances, young apprentice.
