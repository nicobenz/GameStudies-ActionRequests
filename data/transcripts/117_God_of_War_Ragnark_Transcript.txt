I highly recommend that you refresh your memory of the original game before reading this one. You can also read the texts of the previous games, for example GoWIII, they are all great!

[Fimbulwinter. Kratos sits in a cave covered with a black fur hide and looks sadly at the fire. He sighs and pulls out an empty sack containing Faye's ashes. He gently strokes the pouch remembering her. Sighing and putting away the pouch, Kratos takes out a knife and a stick from which he makes an arrow. Out of the white mist, Atreus enters the cave with a deer on his shoulders.]

Atreus: Hungry? 

[Kratos hands him a bundle of made arrows. Atreus examines them and puts them in his quiver with a smile.]

Atreus: What's next? 

Kratos: Home. The storm is getting worse. 

Atreus: I'll get them ready. 

[ATREUS]
Atreus has grown much since our journey to Jötunheim. We have trained through winter upon winter, with no summers between. 
He is stronger, more capable, more adept in battle, and an excellent climber. But he still has much to learn if he is to master his emotions with discipline.
He remains distracted by thoughts of "Loki" and the destiny foretold by the Giants. Whatever his mother's people intended for him—whatever she intended—I will keep him safe, and prepare him. While I can.

[Kratos puts out the fire, picks up the carcass of a deer and leaves the cave. He puts the carcass in the sled with several wolves in it.]

Atreus: Need help? 

[Kratos only grumbles in response, making it clear that he doesn't need any help. While Kratos ties up the deer carcass Atreus examines some stone and quickly puts it away when Kratos approaches him.]

Kratos: Ready? 

[Atreus gets into the sled without a word. Kratos takes the place of the sled's steward.]

Kratos: HAA!

[The wolves rush forward. They lead the sled through the snowy forest.]

THE PATH: Surviving Fimbulwinter
Atreus: I hope Fenrir got some sleep. Maybe he'll be ready to eat when we get home.

Kratos: He is… quite sick, Atreus.

Atreus: I know... but he was a little better yesterday… until he wasn't… If he keeps eating... I'm not giving up on him.

Falcon: (Screech)

Atreus: Hear that?

Kratos: Yes.

Atreus: Is it her?

Kratos: It is her.

[He stops the sled and looks around.]

Kratos: The stave is not far.

[Noticing something, he sharply orders the wolves to move forward.]

Kratos: HAA!

Atreus: Not again…

Kratos: Get ready.

Freya: Fälki! (Falcon!)

[They are attacked with a lust for murder and a sword in her hands by the forest witch Freya. From the moment her son dies, she never misses an opportunity to try to take revenge on Kratos. Kratos blocks her blow with his shield and throws her away, then orders the wolves to move forward again.]

Atreus: She wouldn't give up that easy, would she?

Kratos: She never does. Stay alert.

Atreus: There she is!

[Freya hops into the sled and knocks Kratos off it, and his head rides through the deep snow without Kratos himself falling out of the sled.]

Atreus: Father! Let go of him!

[Kratos pushes Freya away again and Atreus helps him into the sled.]

Atreus: Got you!

Kratos: HAA!

Atreus: We've gotta get away from her!

Kratos: I am trying!

Atreus: Up there! What's she—? LOOK OUT!

[Freya breaks tree trunks in the way of the sled.]

Atreus: The trees! They're coming down!

[By maneuvering Kratos avoids a collision.]

Atreus: That was too close… She's coming around again!

[This time Freya is the first to attack Atreus, knocking him off his sled.]

Kratos: ATREUS!

[After that, she attacks Kratos.]

Kratos: I do not wish to fight you.

Atreus: I'm losing my grip here! Father!

Kratos: I have you! Hold tight! The protection stave is near!

[Freya keeps trying to attack the sled.]

Atreus: Oh no… Freya, we're not your enem—OOF!

[She pushes the boy away, runs up to Kratos and sticks her sword in his shoulder.]

Kratos: Freya, WAIT!

[Freya screams and tries to strangle the Spartan.]

Freya: RRRAAAAA!!

[Atreus draws the bowstring.]

Atreus: Please don't make me do this!

[Taking advantage of Freya's distraction, Kratos pushes her away and draws the sword from his shoulder which he uses to brake the sledge. Freya escapes by turning into a falcon.]

Freya: RRAAGH!

[She stays beyond the barrier she cannot pass, she can only scream in impotent anger.]

Freya: KRATOS!!!

[Even the mountains around begin to shake, turning into a real landslide. Kratos rushes forward on his sled, dodging blocks of ice and falling trees. You can't see the road at all - it's covered in a white mist.]

Kratos: HAA! FASTER!

Atreus: Hurry hurry hurry hurry…

[They barely manage to escape.]

[FREYA]
Freya continues to pursue us, seeking revenge for the death of her son, Baldur. I do not wish to fight her, she was a friend, but I will defend myself if she forces my hand. I do not see a peaceful resolution to our situation.

[BALDUR]
I do not regret Baldur's death. Had I allowed him to kill Freya, he would not have abandoned his pursuit. His fate would have been the same. I do not expect Freya to accept what happened as necessary. She will likely pursue us until one of us is dead.

Atreus: We're through the stave. We made it.

Kratos: Let us go home.

Atreus: Speki! Svanna! Hup! (Wisdom! Swan! Heya!)

[They drive quietly to the house.]

[SPEKI & SVANNA]
Not long ago, we rescued a pack of wolves from Raiders on the Lake of Nine. Despite my warnings, Atreus decided to name them. Having these two to pull the sled has made transportation significantly easier.

Atreus: I'm sorry I couldn't take the shot.

Kratos: I did not wish you to.

Atreus: I keep hoping she'll let it go. You saved her life!

Kratos: I killed her son. There is no letting that go.

Atreus: Yeah… I guess killing Baldur really did bring on Fimbulwinter. It never stopped snowing after that day… Think it's ever gonna get better?

Kratos: Someday. But the worst is so ahead of us. We must be strong.

[They arrive home. Kratos goes to take the reins off the wolves.]

Atreus: I got it.

[He closes the makeshift gate.]

Kratos: I will get the deer—

[Atreus, however, has had time to do this as well. He puts the carcass on a bayonet to make it easier for the wolves to eat.]

Atreus: Go on, girls.

[Kratos looks at this and smiles approvingly.]

Atreus: I don't hear him. He always says hello.

Kratos: Atreus.

Atreus: Fenrir? You okay, boy?

[He sees his beloved wolf barely moving in his own pen, whimpering quietly. Atreus runs up to him and puts his huge head in his lap.]

Atreus: It's okay, boy. You're okay. I know. I missed you too. Where's your food? Still hungry? C'mon, boy. You need to eat. Eat. What—too big?

[He cuts the piece of meat with his knife.]

Atreus: There you go. Good boy.

Kratos: Atreus... the time draws near. You must prepare yourself.

Atreus: For what? He's still eating. He wants to live.

Kratos: He is dying.

Atreus: (almost crying) You're a good boy… …a brave boy. Fast and strong… But you can rest now. Okay?

[Fenrir licks his face.]

Atreus: I'll be okay… you can let go now...

Atreus: Sofna… upp frá þessu… sofna heðan… sofna… (Fall asleep… from now on… fall asleep from here on… fall asleep…) sofna… sofna…

[Fenrir dies quietly and three blue glowing streaks fly out of his mouth and fly away into the air next to Kratos.]

Kratos: Come. We train.

Atreus: What? No. It's the middle of the night.

Kratos: Night does not stop our enemies.

Atreus: Why? What for? Training is all we ever do. Ever! It's not enough. We can't hide forever.

Kratos: We do not hide… We prepare for a fight for which we are not ready. Now go.

Atreus: Time is running out. The prophecies say Fimbulwinter leads to Ragnarok. War is coming. Whatever Loki's supposed to be doing he's supposed to be doing it now. My story doesn't end hiding in this woods. I should be out there finding out who I am… who Loki is.

Kratos: I will not allow you to pick a fight with gods.

Atreus: I don't want to fight anyone. I just want answers.

Kratos: And if those answers lead to war with Asgard?

Atreus: Maybe that's what Mother wanted...

Kratos: We do not know what Mother wanted.

Atreus: Looks like we never will. Look… Can I have a moment alone with Fenrir before I bury him?

[Kratos goes into the house. Mimir is sitting on the table at this moment, trying to read something, holding a spoon in his mouth. He spits it out when Kratos enters.]

Mimir: Well, I'd recognize that sour expression anywhere. Care to tell me what went wrong?

Kratos: The wolf is gone.

Mimir: Aw, no... not Fenrir… How's the lad taking it?

Kratos: Not well. He goes to bury him.

Mimir: Ah, dammit. Alright, brother… Good night then.

[FENRIR]
The wolf, Fenrir, has been in decline for some time now. Atreus cares for the animal deeply and has not been able to accept that he is dying. In the past, I would have told him to close his heart to this loss, but he has already endured so much. I see the compassion in his heart and I am proud of the man he is growing into, but I must keep him focused if he is to be ready for more dark days ahead.

[Kratos goes to sleep. A moment later, a woman's arm wraps around his waist from behind - Kratos is already drifting off to sleep. He gets out of bed and finds himself in a completely different time.]

Faye: Kratos...! Are you joining me?

[In front of him stands his dead wife.]

Kratos: Faye?

Faye: Are you ready?

[They go into the woods.]

Faye: You walk as though Ymir himself sits atop your shoulders.

Kratos: This is your hunt. I will follow.

Faye: Very well, Grumbles.

[They find an animal corpse.]

Faye: A fresh kill. At least it didn't suffer.

Kratos: Hrmph.

Faye: Am I to decipher your grunting? Tell me your thoughts.

Kratos: We hunt a predator…

Faye: A wolf, yes.

Kratos: Predators kill. It is the natural order of things.

Faye: Your words are misguided.

[She sees an animal hiding nearby.]

Faye: Shhhh. Shh. Shh. Approach slowly. It's okay little one. We want to help. Don't we? No-no. Don't—

[The animal runs away.]

Faye: (heavy sigh) Come on. The sick wolf we found beyond our save. He found his way inside as I said he would. We should have acted.

Kratos: It was not our concern. Now it is.

Faye: A problem doesn't have to reach our doorstep for it to be our responsibility. If we have the power to limit the harm it could cause, we should act. Who are we to hide and do nothing?

Kratos: We are not hiding.

Faye: Hup.

[They take several tree trunks out of the way.]

Faye: Gonna make me pick that one up? Good boy. This way.

[Kratos goes after her, but she disappears. Only the wolf grins at him and then runs away.]

Kratos: Faye? Faye! (screams) Faye!

[Suddenly she appears right in front of Kratos and touches his forehead with her hand smeared in something green.]

Faye: Time is running out, my love. And there is much to do.

[A whirlwind begins to swirl around Kratos. He screams and falls on his own bed, continuing to thrash around as if he were having a nightmare.]

Mimir: Brother! Brother! Brother?

Kratos: Where is Atreus?

Mimir: Hence my bellowin'. He never came back from burying the wolf. It's been some time…

Kratos: He cannot be far.

[Kratos takes Mimir with him, abruptly opens the doors, and goes out into the winter cold. The first thing he does is check the gate.]

Kratos: This has not been opened.

Mimir: No prints this way either. Let's see… tracks heading down to the frozen river… that's most likely where he did the burying.

[Kratos approaches a narrow cleft in a cave wall.]

Kratos: He crawled through here.

[The cleft is too small for Kratos, so he takes out his axe and starts chopping the ice.]

Mimir: You seemed troubled to in your sleep, even for you. Nightmares?

Kratos: I dream of the past. Almost every night.

Mimir: Ach… the bad old days, in Greece?

Kratos: No. It feels like Faye is… trying to tell me something.

Mimir: You don't mean to say you're talking to ghosts again, brother…

Kratos: No… but it is something more than memory.

[FAYE]
It has been too long since Faye left us and we spread her ashes from the highest peak in Jötunheim.
A journey she planned, one that neither of us was ready for. I dream of her and simpler times when being together was enough. My duty now lies solely with our son, but I still have so many questions for her. So much that I still do not understand. I see glimmers Of her in Atreus, and they make me smile, but I am left with those same questions as I try to guide him along his path.
He is focused on who he will become, and while it becomes difficult to keep him close, I am grateful I can continue this journey with him, for now.

[He runs down a narrow, snowy passageway and out into the open countryside.]

Kratos: Hmm.

Mimir: Use your words, brother…

Kratos: The tracks stop here…

[He hears belligerent shouts.]

Mimir: …and we're not alone.

[Kratos is run over by two savage warriors. He throws an axe at one of them, freezing him in place, and runs up to the other, beating him with his mighty fists. Returning the axe, he hacks the beaten warrior to death.]

Mimir: Behind you, brother.

[Kratos blocks the attack with his shield and kills the warrior with a powerful axe blow. Two more warriors run up to him and face the same fate.]

Mimir: Left side, brother. More Raiders!

[Kratos kills all the attackers.]

Mimir: Blasted Raiders!

Kratos: They should not be this close.

Mimir: We should check on the protection stave. There's a tree up ahead, yeah?

[Kratos lifts a huge tree blocking the path.]

Mimir: Well?

Kratos: You were right. The stave is broken.

Mimir: Explains our trespassers. What happened here?

Kratos: A bear... mauled.

Mimir: By what?

Kratos: A larger bear. Wounded. The fight destroyed the tree. We must find Atreus.

Mimir: Aye. Between the savage beasts and marauding Raiders, he may have sought shelter. Follow the trail. We'll find him. 

[The further path is also littered with tree trunks.]

Mimir: Ach - we need a way around.

[Kratos enters a nearby cave to retrieve the items lying there.]

Mimir: We won't find him this way. Let's find that trail of blood… Aha - trail's on the other side of that gap, if you can clear the way. Any idea what could have made the lad wander off?

Kratos: We argued. He accuses me of… hiding from Odin.

Mimir: Eh. Only sensible to keep a low profile after killing three of his kin.

Kratos: A reckoning will come. That is why Atreus must learn to survive on his own.

Mimir: Ohhhh... this is about that prophecy. Just because the Giants had you dead on some wall full of… otherwise accurate predictions—

Kratos: I do not believe in prophecies.

Mimir: Well. Good.

Kratos: And what do you believe about prophecy, Mimir?

Mimir: I'm.... skeptical by nature. Though we have seen things that defy explanation. So, speaking as the Smartest Man Alive... I've no bloody idea.

[Kratos notices a raider in the distance. He freezes his axe and attacks him, restraining his movements, then kills him.]

Mimir: Left flank! More Raiders, on your left! Alright, where's that trail gone…?

[Kratos has to face several more raiders.]

Kratos: Too many for a scouting party. They must have a camp nearby.

Mimir: I know what you're thinking, brother. But Atreus can handle himself. You've taught him well.

Kratos: So he keeps telling me.

[He climbs higher and finds a piece of paper.]

[THE ASHEN GOD]
It is the ashen god's fault.
She told us. The witch. Said the ashen god murdered Baldur and in so doing started Fimbulwinter.
She said if the god dies, Fimbulwinter will end. No more night. No more cold. No Ragnarök.
We ran out of food a week ago.
No matter.
Soon we will feast on godflesh.

Kratos: Torches. And the trail leads into that cave.

Mimir: Well, we know where we're going… I'm sure we can find a quiet way in… 

[Kratos destroys the trap at the entrance.]

Mimir: …or you could do that.

[Kratos enters the cave.]

Mimir: Are these the Raiders you rescued the wolves from?

Kratos: No. They have not been here long.

Raider: Ekkert vermir. Eigi skinn né eldr. (Nothing warms me. No skin or fire.)

Raider: Alltaf kalt. (It's always cold.)

Raider: Kjöt vermir. (Meat can warm you.)

Raider: Heyr þú? (Do you hear?)

Raider: Er hann! (It is him!)

[Kratos jumps on top of them and quickly kills both.]

Mimir: The trail goes through here—leads deeper in.

Kratos: There will be more...

Mimir: Well! Someone got in the bear's way…

[Kratos goes into battle again.]

Mimir: That one's got a sling. Look out brother!

[Kratos kills all the raiders in the cave.]

Kratos: Atreus! Are you here?

Mimir: Mm. Well, that's for the best. Let's find a way out. The trail leads back out. We'll need our own way up to find it again…

[Kratos climbs the wall.]

Mimir: Perhaps Atreus came here seeking shelter, kept moving when he saw the Raiders, and the bear came barrelling after. Impressive rampage, I'll give it that.

Kratos: You think the bear was chasing Atreus?

Mimir: Well... just as likely the bear was hurt and Atreus was chasing it to help. You know the lad.

[Kratos goes outside and shouts menacingly to the whole neighborhood.]

Kratos: Atreus! Where are you!?

[With the speed of lightning he is attacked by a bear. A fast and fierce fight begins. Kratos fights the bear with his bare hands. When the player regains control we learn that the bear's name is Björn.]

Mimir: Well, we found the bear! Or he found us! Here it comes! Oh, he seems angry.

[Kratos fights furiously with the bear, but his axe does not seem to do any serious damage to its hide. Then Kratos goes into a Spartan rage and starts beating him with his fists.]

Mimir: Oh you've done it now, bear… Oh-oh! Hit him before he stomps again! Grab him! He's looking shaky, brother!

[Kratos hacks the bear in the head with his axe, but it does not kill it. The bear furiously pushes Kratos violently against a tree and bites into his side. The fierce bare-handed fight continues until Kratos finally overcomes the beast. He begins to emit a golden glow and transforms into... Atreus.]

Kratos: Atreus…?

[He runs up to his son.]

Kratos: Atreus? Atreus!

[He helps him up. His voice and hands are visibly shaking.]

Kratos: Aircus! Atreus. Atreus…

Atreus: What…?

Kratos: First, focus. Heal.

Atreus: What happened?

Kratos: You do not remember?

[Atreus gets up.]

Atreus: I buried Fenrur. And then… I'm not sure… I was so sad… And then I was angry… …then scared. I remember… running? There was a bear. Charging. And… I charged back? But that had to be a dream…

Kratos: Your emotions… …they transformed you.

[A shocked Atreus tries to repeat the transformation.]

Atreus: I-I didn't how I could do that.

Kratos: You did not do anything… ...they overcame you. That is why we must not abandon your training. We do not know the reach of your abilities. They will be dangerous without discipline to control them.

Atreus: You've already caught me discipline. I need more than that. I need answers. Answers you don't have.

Kratos: Answers only your mother had. Answers she withheld.

Atreus: What if there was someone who could help us? Someone that could give us answers about the Giants and who Loki's supposed to be...

Kratos: Atreus…

Atreus: Wouldn't it help to understand what I'm becoming?

Kratos: Atreus! Listen to me. I might have killed you. Until you learn control, we will take no unnecessary risks.

Atreus: Inaction is also a risk. You taught me that. Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking as a General.

Kratos: NO! No. Collect yourself.

[With a few powerful blows Kratos cuts a huge log blocking the way.]

Kratos: This way.

Mimir: So... are we going to discuss the boy becoming a bear?

Atreus: Yeah, are we?

Kratos: Not now. We need to repair the protection stave and get home.

Atreus: What happened to the protection stave?

Kratos: You did.

Aircus: So you're blaming me?

Kratos: I am not blaming you, Atreus.

Atreus: Well... tell your voice that...

[They encounter a raider.]

Atreus: Say the word, Father.

Kratos: Now!

Atreus: Nista!

Mimir: Another Raider, to the left!

Kratos: Incoming fire!

Atreus: Nista!

Mimir: So, lad—besides your gift of language and hearing creatures thoughts, are there any other new magical abilities to report?

Atreus: Not really…

Kratos: What of Fenrir?

Atreus: What about him?

Kratos: When he died. You cast a spell.

Atreus: No, I didn't…

Kratos: But I saw... light…

Atreus: I don't know what you're talking about.

Mimir: Hm... trick of Fimbulwinter, perhaps… seen my share…

Atreus: Oh, I recognize where we are now… What's with all the blood?

Kratos: Yours, Atreus.

Atreus: Seriously?

Mimir: That or any prey you might have been dragging, I suppose.

Atreus: Not sure that makes me feel any better.

[They approach the tree that served as protection.]

Kratos: This one.

[Atreus touches the tree.]

Atreus: Ásjá. (Look.)

[A wave of magical golden light passes through the tree. Behind it comes a roar and Atreus and Kratos grasp their weapons, but it's two cubs who have come looking for their mother and found her dead.]

Atreus: I didn't mean to—

Kratos: Intent does not matter. Only consequences.

[Atreus is saddened to the core by what he has done.]

Atreus: What... what can we do?

Kratos: Nothing. Nature will take its course.

[The cubs run away.]

Mimir: Storm's a-coming.

Atreus: Isn't it cold enough?

Kratos: We are almost home.

[He lifts a large tree blocking the path. They are attacked again by raiders.]

Atreus: Fire from above!

Mimir: Raider, left flank! Behind you!

Atreus: Wow… lotta those guys.

Mimir: It's been like this all night.

Atreus: They must have been inside the stave when I fixed it… Sometimes I really wish Týr's Temple still worked so we could get out of Midgard.

Mimir: They say Fimbulwinter affects all realms, lad.

Atreus: Okay, but... how could things be any worse than here?

[They are returning home. Clouds gather in the sky and thunder rumbles can be heard.]

Atreus: Hey, Svanna (Swan). You're not scared. You're a brave girl. Good, brave girl. That's right…

Mimir: He's good with them. No surprise, really.

Atreus: Speki (Wisdom). You okay? Just a little thunder... that's a good girl... good girl…

Kratos: Atreus.

Atreus: I'm just checking on—

Kratos: To bed.

Atreus: Yes sir.

[Kratos and Atreus enter the house.]

Mimir: As evenings go, that was entirely too eventful. Though I admit it was a bit like old times there for a moment. The three of us, navigating some hitherto-unhappened-upon patch of forest…

Atreus: Been a while since you've joined us, if that's what you mean.

Mimir: Oh. Well... just tired, I suppose. You've seen one deer hunt, you've seen 'em all.

Atreus: How can you feel tired when you never sleep?

Mimir: There are other kinds of tired, lad… You'll see when you're older.

[Kratos and Atreus give themselves up to sleep.]

Mimir: Now have a proper rest, my brothers. Things are always brighter in the morning.

[MIMIR]
Mimir has lived with us since our return from Jotunheim. I have known few I would call friend. and "brother" fewer still... but I have come to rely on the wisdom and counsel of the "smartest man alive." Also, he is compact, and does not consume precious resources.

[A short time later, Kratos wakes up to a mighty peal of thunder!]

Atreus: What was that?!

Kratos: Your bow!

[He comes out of the house, taking his axe off the hook. Outside the door stands a man wearing a hood and a long cloak trimmed with fur. An elaborately crafted hammer is strapped to his belt. A bolt of lightning strikes around the man.]

Kratos: WHO ARE YOU?!

Thor: Can I come in? I have mead.

Kratos: You would not find me good company.

Thor: Oh. I'm sure we'll find lots to talk about.

Kratos: (whispering)

[Kratos whispers something to his son. Atreus leaves. Thor enters the house. He is one and a half times taller than Kratos, who is not a small man himself. Two crows fly into the house with Thor.]

Thor: Nice place.

[Kratos closes the door with his axe. Thor sits at the table and puts his Mjölnir on it. Kratos puts his Leviathan on the table. Atreus puts two cups in front of them. Thor pours the mead. He holds out the second cup to Kratos, but Kratos stops his hand.]

Thor: You coulda told me before I poured.

Kratos: Why are you here?

Thor: Just, uh, being polite.

[A crow sits on the table and caws something to Thor.]

Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. 

[He dips two fingers in his cup and wipes them on his hammer.]

Thor: Are you… a calm and reasonable person?

Kratos: If the moment calls for calm.

Thor: I'd say the moment calls for calm, yeah.

[Someone knocks on the door. Kratos looks at Atreus letting him open. Behind the door stands an elderly man with a patch over his left eye. The two ravens that were in the house fly into his arms.]

Odin: You know who I am. Back before winter set in, there were some... misunderstandings. Regrettable ones.

[He sits down at the table.]

Odin: But I think we all have a better idea of who we're dealing with. Now, what you did to his boys… self-defense. Dying is what we Aesir live for. And let's be honest, they were kinda useless. But Baldur..... he had value. He was my best tracker. My closer. Yeah, his mind was gone, sure. But he had his uses, and now he's gone, because of you. You follow me?

[He takes a sip from his son's cup.]

Odin: You have a debt. You're no fun anymore.

Kratos: What do you want?

[One takes another sip.]

Odin: How about peace? How does peace strike the esteemed, retired god of war? How about we just don't kill each other? How about you stay home. Kick up your feet. Seek no quarrel with me, and I'll have none with you. Of course, it means that that one… ...chat one has to stop his search for Týr.

Thor: Yeah. We know what you've been up to. Stop it.

Odin: Týr's old ways are dead. He is dead. Y'understand? And then that's it. Then we're square. Shit, I'll even sweeten the deal... I'll let you keep the prisoner that I know you stole. (laughs) That's right! I know you're in here somewhere, you silver-tongued little shit.

Mimir: Why should we believe a word out of you! What have your promises ever been worth!

[Atreus takes Mimir out of the box.]

Odin: There he is. My old partner in crime.

Thor: He's lose weight.

Mimir: If he tells you snow is white, he's lying.

Odin: What kind of wisdom is that? Can't the smartest head alive see past himself? See that we all want the same thing! Alright... Here's a deal I know you can trust. I'll settle your debt with my ex. Keep Freya off your back. Keep your boy… safe. That's really all you want, isn't it? So what do you say?

[Kratos stands up and slowly approaches Odin.]

Kratos: No.

[One walks toward the exit, turning to his son.]

Odin: Don't take all day.

Thor: 'Bout time.

[He throws his Mjölnir straight into Kratos' jaw, and he flies through the roof into the sky with great force, trying to wrest the hammer from his face with his hands. The God of Thunder flies up to him, grasping the handle.]

Thor: I've been waiting for this. You're not from here. We got a tradition called "blood payments." It means I get a piece of you, for what you took from my family. You'll pick it up. 

[They fly down at great speed, knocking over chunks of rock and various stone structures as they continue to fight. They fall into a small arena in the mountains.]

Thor: That was for Baldur. Now show me this god-killer I've heard so much about.

[The epic battle begins!!!]

Thor: How were you ever a god of war?

Kratos: I did not seek that fight with your brother.

Thor: I don't care. You insult me holding back like this.

[Kratos activates Spartan Rage.]

Thor: What's THIS? Now we're talking!

Kratos: You know my past?

Thor: The "Ghost of Sparta" thing? Yeah.

Kratos: Then you know what I'm capable of.

Thor: Show me. Now we got us a fight. 

[After a short battle during which, by the way, Thor fights with his bare hands, he eventually takes out his hammer and hits Kratos in the jaw with such force that he flies into the sky and breaks some statue with his body. Thor follows him.]

Thor: That's for Magni!

Thor: Sorry about your statue Týr... you preachy old stiff!

[While he is distracted Kratos picks up a huge stone column and hits Thor with it.]

Thor: If you're not fighting dirty, you're not fighting, right?

Kratos: Your sons struck first.

Thor: Good!

[They keep fighting, but Thor clearly has the advantage.]

Thor: You can do better!

[They continue to fight. Thor is clearly unimpressed with Kratos' fighting abilities.]

Thor: Was it luck? Did my sons die to blind fucking luck?

[Kratos throws Thor's hammer at him and runs to Thor, but the hammer returns to Thor's hand and hits Kratos on the head.]

Thor: Dumbass. You think you can come here, become a daddy, get a clean slate? That's ain't how it works. You're destroyer, like me.

[They struggle, but Thor knocks Kratos out with a blow from Mjölnir. Kratos' eyes go dark.]

Thor: Oh, no... I say when we're done!

[He uses his hammer as a defibrillator to bring Kratos back to life again.]

Thor: I'm not leaving 'til I see the real you. Get up!

[The fight goes on!]

Thor: You're holding back! Why?! This is for Modi!

[He throws his Mjölnir at Kratos and Kratos throws his Leviathan. The axe and the hammer collide in the air without yielding to each other. They just hang in the air.]

Kratos: You put him last, even in death.

Thor: The fuck you say?

Kratos: Modi sought us in fear of you. He died of the wounds you gave him.

Thor: Oh. We got a MODEL FATHER here.

[They take their weapons and attack. A powerful wave forms, knocking them both aside. A frozen lightning bolt forms in the center of the arena.]

Thor: This feels familiar.

Kratos: What?

Thor: Don't matter. I could give a hot shit about your fatherly advice. I want to see the god of WAR!

[Kratos again begins to chop his mighty opponent, who is not trying very hard to defend himself. Kratos throws his axe into the block of ice behind Thor.]

Thor: Clever! Clever won't beat me.

[He smashes the falling block with a blow of his fist. Kratos and Thor continue to fight furiously until Thor gets tired of it and grabs Kratos by the throat, swinging his hammer.]

Thor: I see why my sons fell to you. Even this, lesser version of you. But I am not my sons. And your boy! All-Father has plans for him.

[Kratos breaks free from the iron grip of the Thunder God, strikes him with his head and then with his right hand with all the force he has.]

Kratos: (yells)

[Thor only laughs and waves Mjölnir in his direction.]

Thor: There he is. 

[He takes a tooth out of his mouth and throws it away.]

Thor: There's the god of war. Consider your blood debt paid. Be seeing ya.

[He flies away, grasping the handle of his hammer and spewing discharges of lightning. When Thor is out of sight, Kratos is bent over with pain in his chest. The icy part of the mountain crumbles and from there two old acquaintances emerge, clad in winter clothes.]

Brok: Toldja he'd make it.

Sindri: Kratos! It's Sindri and Brok! That was quite a fight... Can we—?

[Kratos, however, is not going to hesitate for a second. He answers sharply.]

Kratos: Home. Now Odin is with Atreus.

Sindri: Oh no… I’ll go get a gateway ready.

Brok: C'mon then. Ain't a long walk. Well, good to see you makin’ new friends. Ain't that Mjölnir pack a punch? You know we made that laminer, right?

Kratos: You have mentioned it.

Brok: I know that! Wasn't ever sure you were listenin’. Least it was rood to see the Axe hold her own. Kinda the point, after all.

[ODIN]
Like his son before him, Odin has come to our door. He does not seek vengeance for Baldur, but instead he speaks of peace and inaction. Odin claims that Atreus has been searching for Týr and has requested he halt this endeavor. I am not pleased that he knows more about what my son is doing than I. While I do not approve of what Atreus has done behind my back, I will not abide the gods of this realm coming to my home and dictating our actions. If he does not want us searching for Týr, it is likely that is exactly what we should be doing.
I must note that he offered a deal of peace for our inaction. If I did not have better counsel, I would have been tempted to take it. His threat to Freya made this impossible. She may persist as a danger, but to ally against her with her former husband is... unacceptable.

[THOR]
There are many differences between Thor and his brother Baldur. Baldur fought wildly, his motivation to inflict pain. Thor is calmer his bloodlust is for the fight itself, not for the suffering it inflicts. The full force of his attack is as heavy as any I have felt. The Hammer, Mjölnir, only compounds his power... each blow echoes with the death and destruction they have wrought together. He chose to end our fight prematurely. It is good for both of us that it did not reach its conclusion.

[MAGNI & MODI]
Magni and Modi, the sons of Thor, also pursued us on our journey. Magni was strong, but arrogant until his last breath. Modi proved himself a coward, but I pitied him in his last moments. There seems to be little forgiveness among the Aesir gods, and I expect that we have yet to suffer the consequences of the blood we spilled.

[BROK]
The Dwarven blacksmith Brok was the first ally we encountered when we set out for the Mountain's peak. He and his brother Sindri made the Leviathan Axe for Faye, and this has been our common bond. Brok is blunt. with a foul tongue. but there is a wisdom in his bluster. I find him acceptable company.

[SINDRI]
On our journey to Jötunheim, Sindri proved himself a capable blacksmith and valuable ally. Now he has been helping Atreus in his search for Týr. I am unhappy this was done without my knowledge... though it is better Atreus was not alone on this path. I will attempt to spare the Dwarf my wrath. It may not be easy.

[They enter Sindri and Brok's store, which is now all icy. Sindri opens the portal.]

Sindri: All set! This’ll get you home.

[Kratos enters the portal into the realm between worlds.]

Brok: Hey, one last thing there, Tiny. If you got Aesir at your door, then I reckon your protection stave's busted. Once you chase Odin off, you get another place to lay your head tonight? And I don't mean that talky fella.

Kratos: I will not abandon my home.

Brok: Oh yeah? And what's to stop the All-Fucker from spyin' on ya—or raven-peckin' your house to splinters while you're asleep in it? Nothin', that's what. You go get your boy, and I'll speak to a certain someone about puttin' you up at his place in a pinch.

[Kratos passes through the portal on the other side and ends up right outside his home. He enters the house ready for battle, but Odin is not there. Atreus comes out to him with Mimir in his hands.]

Mimir: Brother!

Atreus: I was about to look for you.

[Kratos touches Atreus’ face.]

Kratos: Are you hurt?

Atreus: Are YOU?

[He gives Mimir's head back to Kratos and he puts it back on his belt.]

Kratos: What did he want?

Atreus: To, uh, pay for the roof.

[He holds out a coin to Kratos.]

Atreus: And… He invited me to Asgard.

Mimir: Did he? I couldn't hear once you went outside.

Atreus: I… I told him "no." Obviously.

Kratos: Good. Why were you searching for Týr?

Atreus: If I'd told you I was looking for him, you would have said not to!

Kratos: So you hid the truth. From me.

Atreus: I wanted to tell you... I really did, but… ...now that you know, there's something you should see.

Kratos: No.

[Atreus goes to the door and opens it.]

Atreus: Just trust me, you'll want to—

[Kratos slams the door furiously.]

Kratos: Trust? You have broken my trust.

Atreus: Then let me regain it. Let me show you what I found. Besides… we haven't seen the last of Odin. Or Thor. And clearly they can just walk in and blast holes in our home whenever they want. There's only one way to get them off our backs. And I think I know how… …Sir.

[He stands staring at the floor for a minute. Kratos looks at him menacingly and then steps aside. He walks over to the pole on which the Blades of Chaos hang and removes them, taking them with him.]

Kratos: Show me. Gather your things.

[He takes the artifacts from the table obtained in the previous game, and also takes his equipment from the chest.]

Kratos: Are you ready?

[Atreus nods affirmatively.]

Kratos: Go.

[As he leaves the house, Kratos picks up Odin's coin, which he had placed on the table. As he leaves the house he throws it into the sky with all his might.]

Mimir: And keep the change, ya bastard!

[A new journey begins! Kratos looks around the house in search of a route.]

Atreus: There's no shortcut. We can walk it, believe me. That's not the way, Father... come on!

Kratos: Where are we going?

Atreus: The old temple in the Wildwoods.

Kratos: Why?

Atreus: It'll be easier to explain once we're there.

Mimir: Did Odin say anything else while you were outside?

Atreus: Yeah—he said he doesn't care about Jötunheim anymore. That the Giants can keep their secrets, he's averted Ragnarök his own way. You think he knows all the Giants are dead?

Mimir: I'm more concerned that it no longer matters to him. What's he up to…?

[Atreus finds several bloody corpses lying on the ground. The corpses are pierced with black arrows.]

Atreus: What happened here? So close to home…

Mimir: Are Raiders warring with one another now?

Kratos: Those are not their arrows. Something else is out here.

[Not far away they find a body hanging upside down.]

Atreus: More over here... and fresh. Did they all get in while the stave was down?

Mimir: That, or Odin cocked up the protection spell altogether…

Kratos: What do you see?

Atreus: Hm... just animal tracks. Almost to the bridge. Oh. Guess the bridge gave out. Gonna need another path to the temple.

Mimir: Why would you come out this way alone, lad?

Atreus: I had… dreams. Calling me here.

Kratos: (grunts) Dreams…

[Kratos breaks the wooden wall with his axe and they see a poor man hanging by his legs from a tree.]

Atreus: Whoa. That one's still alive!

Kratos: No, look closer.

Atreus: Ugh... Hel— Raiders now! Who's doing this?

Mimir: Suppose it's too much to hope that an enemy of theirs would be a friend of ours.

Atreus: Yeah, probably.

[HEL-RAIDER]
Your standard Stag-styled Raider, only dead and far more dangerous for it. Relentless, frenzied, rageful creatures... lighting them on fire should help calm them down!

[They're moving on.]

Mimir: You see something down there?

Kratos: Hold…

[He notices a raider standing in the distance. It's not quite clear whether he's alive or a zombie. Suddenly he is abruptly grabbed by a rope and dragged around a corner.]

Mimir: Whoa! Bloody now brother what was that?

Kratos: Something strong. And dangerous. Be on guard.

Atreus: Oh yeah. Being all the way on guard.

Mimir: Whatever it is, it works fast…

Atreus: There's the temple now. Just need to find a way around.

[On their way they meet several hel-raiders. One of them attacks Kratos and he is covered with a thin layer of ice. His movements are slowed.]

Atreus: Whoa, that looks cold!

Kratos: Where did this bridge collapse?

Atreus: Oh, a while ago. Wasn't me! Remember when I said there was someone who might help us get answers about the Giants and Loki?

Kratos: You mean Týr. The old god of war in these lands. Who is dead.

Mimir: Well... for a dead man, Odin seemed pretty keen on seeing he wasn't found.

Atreus: Right? He knows Týr could unite the realms against him. Plus, Týr was the Giants' greatest ally, so—

Kratos: Enough.

[They climb down the mountain in silence for a while. Kratos uses his Blades of Chaos to go down and up.]

Atreus: Still putting up offerings to Odin… I don't think he cares.

[They enter a small cave that is clearly someone's home. A large raider jumps out at them from above.]

Atreus: Look out! Nista!

[Kratos and Atreus quickly kill the savage attacker, but he immediately turns into a zombie.]

Mimir: Well! They return from the dead rather swiftly, don't they?

[When they win, they go outside.]

Atreus: Uhh... that pillar wasn't in the way last time I came…

[Kratos throws his Blades at the fallen column and pulls it to the other side, forming a passage.]

Atreus: Like I was saying. Týr was an ally to the Giants, so he'd be on our side if we find him... and if anyone might know who I'm supposed to be, it's him. If he's out there, we gotta find him. How can we not?

Kratos: Those are many "ifs", Atreus. What do you know?

Atreus: You'll see soon.

[Kratos fixes the rope bridge and while he descends it on the axe gets a chance to talk to Mimir alone.]

Kratos: What do you think?

Mimir: Can't imagine what the lads found, but he says he has evidence. We've come this far, let's see it.

Kratos: Many dead here.

Atreus: We... Should keep moving.

Mimir: Too late!

[Kratos is left alone with the dead.]

Atreus: Father! Use your blades! Burn them!

[Kratos begins spinning the Blade of Chaos, charging it with fire. The attack sets the dead on fire, inflicting additional damage.]

Atreus: They're stunned! Grab 'em!

Mimir: Nicely done!

Atreus: Incoming fire, behind you!

Mimir: Behind you, look out!

Atreus: Nista!

Mimir: Isn't it nice how Fimbulwinter wore down the helpful magic we acquired, yet somehow new terrors only flourish? As if on cue!

[After defeating several raiders, Kratos approaches the wall and reads the glowing runes.]

Kratos: "Kill… Winter-Man."

Atreus: Yup! You got it… …wonder who they mean.

Kratos: We climb.

Atreus: On it.

[WINTER-MAN?]
"Kill Winter-man"
The runes appear to be the work of Raiders, but I do not know the "Winter-man". Their attacks have increased of late. Perhaps he is the source of their agitation.

[Kratos and Atreus begin to climb the icy, steep wall.]

Mimir: Hunh. He has gotten rather good at that.

[Once in, they encounter several zombies.]

Mimir: Yet another grisly scene… Left side!

Atreus: Nista!

[The ascent continues.]

Mimir: I've seen my share of bloodshed, but this is an awful lot for one morning…

[Suddenly, a thin knife on a rope pokes into Kratos' shoulder and pulls him to the ground.]

Mimir: Oh no! Brother!

[For a while Kratos fights the creature that captured him - a female centaur with horns and a bow in her hands. The centaur is called The Huntress. Atreus jumps off to help his father.]

Mimir: A Stalker! On your guard, brother—I think we've found our predator!

Atreus: Nista! Its horns are glowing! Might be a weak point! Nista!

[After a fierce fight, Kratos still manages to win.]

Mimir: Well, that just bloody tears it! Fimbulwinter, Freya, the Raiders, Thor and Odin barging in, and now Stalkers preying on our woods... this is no safe haven anymore.

[THE HUNTRESS]
The Stalker that ambushed us has broken my shield. She was a formidable huntress and fought well. I must alter my defensive strategy now that I do not have the ability to block. At least now we will be mentally prepared if we encounter another Stalker.

[Kratos and Atreus continue their interrupted ascent.]

Atreus: Father. The shield mom gave you...

Kratos: Thor damaged it, but now...

Mimir: Perhaps the Dwarves could take a look at it.

Kratos: Perhaps. Later.

Atreus: Come on, we can get in this way…

[They enter the cave that leads to the temple. The walls are covered with icicles and many passages inside are blocked with snow.]

Kratos: Why are we here, Atreus?

Atreus: Okay—you remember all those Shrines we found, telling the stories of Giants? How panel on the left would be their origin, and the panel on the right would be their fate—?

Kratos: Yes. We found many. I have seen them.

Atreus: Well... there's more to them than we realized.

[They go out into the courtyard. Kratos looks around and finds a grave from which he gets some hacksilver and metal for forging.]

Atreus: How do you always know how to find those…

[The way forward is blocked by a huge statue of some kind of monster that looks like a werewolf.]

Atreus: Well, the collapsed pillar is new... but the shrine is just on the other side!

[Kratos cuts the fallen tree with a powerful throw of his axe and then throws the statue aside by hooking it with the Blades of Chaos.]

Atreus: That should help. There we go—c'mon!

Mimir: Hmm... things collapsing on a regular basis in these parts.

Kratos: Fimbulwinter wears down all things. Even stone.

[Kratos and Atreus, after a short wander around the temple, find the same drawing on the wooden panel, closed by two flaps. Atreus pushes the flaps aside.]

Atreus: You watching?

[Atreus touches the pattern and it crumbles, forming a passage.]

Mimir: Well that's new.

Atreus: C'mon…

[He opens a door, behind which there is a portal shining with golden light.]

Kratos: Atreus... wait...

Mimir: Yeah, I don't think he's waiting.

[Atreus runs into the portal. Kratos has no choice but to follow him. They enter a kind of inter-world. Golden particles flying through the air form pictures and runes above them. As time passes, the pictures change.]

Mimir: What is this, lad? Where are we?

Atreus: Somewhere only Giants were meant to see. These shrines tell their stories to the world, but it turns out the real stories, the secret stories… ...those they kept here, inside. You remember the story of Sköll and Hati, the Wolf-Giants? Odin captured them because he thinks it'll help him control when Ragnarök starts.

Kratos: I remember.

Atreus: But that's not the whole story. See… This shows the Giants setting Sköll and Hati free.

Mimir: They're free? Is this the past or the future?

Atreus: Depends when you're looking at it.

Mimir: Spoken like a Giant...

Atreus: See? The wolves are safe, somewhere in Vanaheim.

Mimir: Not the first place Odin would look, I suppose...

Atreus: There they are, chasing the sun and moon.

Mimir: Old habits...

Atreus: Until—look—the moon gets stolen. Somehow.

Kratos: Atreus...

Atreus: See, Hati's got nothing to chase.

Mimir: And they say celestial theft is a victimless crime...

Atreus: Not totally sure who this is, but someone comes along and rescues the moon… ...and then the moon blocks out the sun.

Mimir: A total eclipse... haven't seen one of those in a hundred winters.

Atreus: But then they chase an arrow, and things go back to normal.

Kratos: What does any of this have to do with—

Atreus: We're coming to that. Look—here's Ragnarök. Do you see who's leading the armies against Odin? That's Týr! If he's gonna be around at Ragnarök, that means he's gotta be alive. Right?

Kratos: Mimir—can this be?

Mimir: Odin told me he killed Týr. And he trusted me at the time, or so I thought.

Atreus: What if he didn't kill him? What if he's just had him locked up somewhere all this time?

Kratos: We are back to "ifs"—enough.

Atreus: Wait—

Kratos: We are going home.

Atreus: Wait! I have one more thing to show you. It's just out here…

[SKÖLL & HATI]
Of all the stories Mimir told us of the Giants, this was among the most difficult to believe. Giant wolves with the power to chase day into night and back again? Yet the secrets Atreus uncovered within their shrine reveal they are alive... and perhaps, then, so is Týr.

[They enter the portal and return to the temple.]

Kratos: What is this?

Atreus: Everything I've found. Well... almost everything.

[He takes a pebble out of his pocket and hands it to Kratos.]

Mimir: That's Giant craftsmanship. You've been to Jötunheim again?

Atreus: No—I found it in one of the other shrines.

Kratos: "Other shrines." How many have you visited?

Atreus: I, well... all of them? All the ones I could still get to in Midgard anyway.

[He squats down by the mural.]

Atreus: I don't know what it is. But it's important… ...just like all this. When I was inside one of the shrines, I saw an image of Týr imprisoned, but I couldn't tell where. There are hints inside the other shrines—they mention ...black smoke and the bleeding earth. But we could never figure out exactly—

Kratos: We?

[Kratos is clearly displeased with his son's willfulness. He looms over him threateningly. Atreus backs away.]

Atreus: Sindri's been helping me. Look, I talked him into it—it wasn't his idea. I just needed someone to watch my back—

Kratos: Black smoke. Bleeding earth. Could the prison be in Muspelheim?

Mimir: Unlikely. Odin's got no presence to speak of in the primordial realms. But the bleeding earth... sounds like a mine, aye?

Kratos: The realm of the Dwarves, perhaps?

Mimir: Svartalfheim, that's a good bet. Their mines did belch black smoke, and Odin's had his thumb on the Dwarves for a very long time.

Atreus: That's it, then! Týr's in Svartalfheim somewhere, imprisoned in a mine. So what now?

Kratos: Home.

Atreus: This way.

Mimir: Lad. Even if we consider looking for Týr, how do you have us getting to Svartalheim? You know Odin's had all travel between realms locked up tight.

Atreus: Sindri said he had an idea or two about that.

Kratos: Sindri is full of ideas.

Atreus: Hunh... ground looks kinda cracked there.

[They're exploring their surroundings a little bit.]

Atreus: Remember when we fought our first troll out this way?

Kratos: I remember you lost control.

Atreus: (sighs)

Mimir: We must tread carefully, brother. Danger is close.

Atreus: You okay fighting without a shield?

Kratos: It is not my first time.

[After moving further away, Kratos once again gets a chance to talk to Mimir alone. He switches to whispering.]

Kratos: Mimir. What did you hear of Odin's offer?

Mimir: To the lad? Not much. They stepped outside. But he told us about it—I won't worry.

Kratos: What about the things he did not tell us?

[When Kratos returns to his son they are attacked by zombies.]

Atreus: Nista!

Mimir: Brother, there's no blocking without your shield! Behind you, incoming!

Atreus: Behind you! Nista!

[They win the battle.]

Atreus: Whew! Almost home…

[He runs forward.]

Mimir: Brother... a word? Don't hold the lad's curiosity against him. It goes with being young.

Kratos: In my youth we learned obedience.

Mimir: And is that what you wish for him? Brother, he's going to walk his own path. If you don't want him walking away from you, then smarten up and walk with him awhile.

Kratos: Hm.

Atreus: If we could find a way to open realm travel to Svartalfheim, I bet there'd be all sorts of useful equipment for us to—

Kratos: Enough. We will go.

Atreus: Really?!

Kratos: But if we do not find Týr, you will abandon your search. For good.

Atreus: Alright! You won't be sorry.

[They approach the house.]

Sindri: Kratos! Over here!

Atreus: Sindri!

[Sindri pretends that he hasn't seen Atreus for a long time, but he's so terribly overacting it that anyone would notice that something is off.]

Sindri: As I live and breathe—is that ATREUS? It's been so long! How you've grown!
Atreus: Uh... oh, yeah.

Kratos: Hrm…

Sindri: Well, if you'll follow me—Brok mentioned you needed somewhere safe to spend the night, and I believe your favorite Dwarves can help you out with that! We're still your favorite Dwarves, right?

Atreus: You're still the only Dwarves we know!

Sindri: I'll take it!

[He opens the portal.]

Sindri: After you, my friends…

[SURVIVING FIMBULWINTER completed!]

Atreus: Where are we going?

Sindri: The cleanest cabin in all the Nine Realms. And I'd prefer it to stay that way. Not looking at anyone in particular. Kratos.

Kratos: Hrmph...

Sindri: After that Thor incident, we thought we should make up some rooms, 'til you figure out your next moves. Nearly there!

[They go into another portal to a small piece of land with a tree in the center inside of the tree built a house.]
Sindri: As you can see, we've settled here in the Realm Between Realms. It's nothing much, but it's safe from Fimbulwinter, safe from Odin's eyes, and you really can't beat the view if you're into shimmering gray voids.

Atreus: That's amazing, Sin. We have a plan to talk to you about, actually...

Sindri: Intriguing!

[They come to the door.]

Sindri: Come in, come in… Now, if you would just wipe your feet VERY thoroughly. I'll wait.

[Kratos looks at him threateningly.]

Sindri: You're not gonna wipe your feet, are you? Okay then. Your bedrooms are there; the kitchen is just over there. Any-anybody need a snack? Kratos? Snack?

Kratos: I do not need a snack.

Atreus: What we NEED is your help getting to Svartalfheim so we can try and rescue Týr.

Sindri: T-Týr...? Al-Alive? I mean that's… Whaaaaat?

Atreus: It's okay, I told him everything.

Sindri: Everything?

Kratos: You aided my son in disobeying me.

Sindri: No, I... I kept an eye on him. On your behalf. Nothing risky. Everything very safe. Somebody else speak.

Atreus: What's important right now is that we try and open up travel between realms again. You said you know a way?

Sindri: Yes! I do! I just… It's just, there's—it's just a lot of mud.

[He starts frantically sweeping the floor.]

Mimir: Then why haven't you opened the way already, man?

Sindri: Well, to be frank... there was something we needed your help with.

Mimir: Oh-ho! The Huldra Brothers finally require the services of the Smartest Man Alive.

Sindri: That's it precisely.

[Brok rumbles into the house.]

Brok: Hey! Not so fast! How'd that get in here? What in the Hel is it, anyway?

[Brok turns out to be much lower in height than Atreus.]

Kratos: That is my son.

Brok: Well... what in all of Jarnsmida happened to him? He's too damn tall now. And he looks like… that.

[He points at Kratos.]

Brok: I blame you. Well, c'mon then, let's get him something that fits, at least...

Mimir: He's just getting older you daft prat. Didn't you ever have an awkward phase in your youth?

Atreus: Hey!

[Brok goes to the counter of his store.]

Brok: I s'pose what's done is done. But you'll be puttin' your foot down from now on, if you know what's good.

Mimir: Oh, he's trying. Believe me.

Brok: Alright, let's gear you fuckers up before you go off gallavantin'...

Kratos: Begin with this.

[He puts the broken shield on the counter.]

Brok: Hmm. Busted up good. Wouldn't ya rather I just whip you up a new one?

Kratos: It is... important to me.

Brok: Wellllll, I'll see what I can do. In the meanwhiles, how about I fix you up with something to get you by?

[Kratos creates a new outfit for himself and his son.]

Brok: Found some items you left behind, tossed 'em in the chest. What would you without me?

Atreus: I'm gonna go look around, check out my room… Tell Sindri when you're ready!

[Kratos retrieves the lost loot from the chest.]

Mimir: I knew we'd left something behind!

[Kratos buys more gear.]

Brok: No refunds.

Mimir: And how's life been treating everyone's favorite azure vulgarian?

Brok: The fuck you call me?

Mimir: Hah! Exquisite.

[Kratos goes to Sindri.]

Sindri: See, I knew you wanted a snack.

Kratos: Hmph.

Atreus: Hey, come see. I guess this is where they store the food. Nice to have options if I wake up hungry.

Sindri: Finding everything all right, I hope?

Kratos: How do we unlock the realms?

Sindri: We'll just need something from back at the workshop. Follow me! And be sure to bring the head!

Mimir: Hmph.

Sindri: So, where exactly is Týr being held?

Atreus: He's imprisoned in a mine somewhere... that's all we know so far.

Sindri: Hm... the realm is full of mines, you realize. You'll need help narrowing it down. Oh! You should talk to Durlin.

Atreus: Who's Durlin?

Sindri: He's a cousin of ours, sort of... works for the city on safety issues—should have access to all kinds of information on mines. And I know he's no friend of Odin. That's why your mother sought his help when she was trying to whip up a rebellion. Ready?

Atreus: A rebellion? Did you know about that?

Kratos: I did not.

Atreus: A rebel leader who knew Mom? Sounds like exactly what we need!

Sindri: Ta-da! I think you missed the "ta-da"... Well, never mind. I'll have this oiled up in no time. Meet you at the gateway outside!

Brok: "Rebel leader?" Durlin? PHUH! If that ain't givin' a hound a haircut...

Atreus: Huh?

Brok: And you… you just remember things however they pop into your bean, doncha? I suppose you think Durlin's just countin' the days until a coupla strays show up looking for trouble.

Atreus: What do you mean, Brok?

Kratos: Will he help us or not?

Brok: Oh, never mind. It ain't ol' Brok's place to cast asparagations on my relations. This smudge sponger notwithstanding.

Sindri: Ignoring you!

Brok: Fine, go darken Durlin's door. See for yourself how it goes! Just be warned he's not the friendly sort of Dwarf-folk you're used to. He's cranky as all get-out, and he talk funny too.

Mimir: Sounds like a true study in contrast.

Atreus: I've always wanted to see your home realm. Svartalfheim sounds... unique.

Brok: "Svartalfheim!" Phuh—stupid Aesir name... we look like Dark Elves to you?

Atreus: Oh right... you call the realm something else...

Sindri: Niðavellir... which is also the name of the capital city, and where you should look for Durlin.

Brok: Damn city's so full of Odin-fuckers nowadays, it ain't hardly somewhere a self-respectin' Dwarf would show his face.

Sindri: Harsh! But accurate.

[Kratos comes out of the house.]

Atreus: You hear that...? Are those some kind of dragons? They're so far, I can't tell how big they are…

[Kratos throws an axe at it!]

Atreus: What are you doing? I don't think they're a threat. Also, aren't you way out range?

Sindri: We'll just need the Bifröst and the head. Brok, do the touching.

Mimir: Ah, this would be the part requiring my assistance then?

Sindri: You said it. This device here has been crafted to your measurements. It'll help you get a better look at the problem, with those Bifröst eyes of yours.

[He puts Mimir in a device resembling half a bagel. Mimir's head is on one side and the flashlight on the other.]

Mimir: So, I... do I control this thing somehow, then?

Sindri: Oh, no, no, no no no no no… This is just to hold you in place while we…...shine this light in your eyes.

[Sindri turns on the flashlight.]

Mimir: Argh! Sindri, you sodding bastard!

Brok: Hoooohohohohoho!

Sindri: Open, open now… I was really hoping not to use the eyelid clamps...

Brok: Do it! Aaaahahahahah!

Mimir: Augh!

Sindri: That's it… that's it… good! Now release!

Mimir: Still... unpleasant…

[The beam from Mimir's eyes hits the door, forming a magical circle on it.]

Sindri: That's our cue. C'mon, hurry!

Brok: I'm comin', I'm comin'...

Mimir: Hræsvelgr's EGGS, man what was that for!?

[Brok and Sindri bang on the door with hammers.]

Sindri: You'll see soon enough. Just need to adjust... there! That should do it. See? No permanent damage.

Mimir: I'll show you permanent damage, ya wee fuck! Kratos! Throw me at him! Horns first!

Brok: Aww, can'ts ya takes a joke, you old goat? (laughs)

[Kratos takes Mimir's head.]

Kratos: The Bifröst is broken.

Sindri: Now that we've reconfigured these gateways to use Yggdrasil Seeds, you won't need a travel table or a Bifröst lamp anymore!

Kratos: I also used it for light.

Sindri: Okay. Good note. I'll figure something out! But first, come look, let me show you how it works.

[Kratos approaches the door, between worlds, the magic circle on which has turned into a pattern on the door.]

Sindri: Okay—aim your key at the rune for Svartalfheim, on the right. Then concentrate...

[Kratos gets the ability to customize the door and thus move between worlds. He activates the desired world and opens the door.]

Sindri: This should take you to the wetlands outside Niðavellir city. Just make your way to the town square and ask for Durlin at the tavern.

Atreus: You're sure they'll know him at the tavern?

Sindri: Durlin's always been an inveterate inebriate. I suppose he might have completely changed, but in my experience... Eh!

Atreus: Did you want to come with us?

Sindri: Oh, I might drop in... But the wetlands are... moist. And the Grim are everywhere. Hostile, slimy, foul-smelling creatures… But good luck!

Atreus: Thanks! Wait, what?

Sindri: I said "good luck!"

[Kratos and Atreus enter the portal on the other side.]

THE PATH: The Quest for Týr
[Kratos and Atreus find themselves in a mountainous, barren world. The sun shines brightly and birds sing. Sparse trees grow at the top of the rocky passages, and wisps of yellow grass rustle beneath Kratos feet.]

Atreus: Whoa. Do you feel that?

Mimir: What's that, lad?

Atreus: Anything, e-everything. It's warm! We can probably use this boat, if I can just get it free… Hnnng.

Mimir: Careful, lad…

[Atreus tries to remove the boat from the stand, but it won't move. We notice that it is chained.]

Atreus: Ahh!

[From under the ground they are attacked by creatures similar to scorpions but much faster.]

Atreus: Why are these things so fast? Nista!

[They quickly defeat creatures called Wretch.]

[WRETCH]
Oh, how I'd jump at the chance to smash these little blighters with a well-aimed hoof. The stench they give off rivals a Troll's bonch, and then some. On their own, they may seem an easy foe, but rarely are they seen without companions. A pack of Wretches will quickly overwhelm even the strongest of enemies. 
Wretches thrive in wetlands. Find any body of water and they'll likely be nearby, basking in mud and filth, not doing any favors to their already unique scent. You'll need to be quick on your feet during an encounter with a Wretch of any kind... and watch the teeth! 

[Kratos and Atreus defeat all enemies.]

Mimir: I see we're already off to a lively start.

Kratos: Atreus, you drop your guard.

Atreus: I got the boat free, though. We can head through these channels when we're ready.

[They come ashore. Most of the world turns out to be covered by water. A thick metal chain is stuck into the pier, extending somewhere in the distance.]

Atreus: What's the chain in the water for?

Mimir: That'd be a Dwarven supply ferry. Said ferry appears to be missing.

[Kratos pushes the boat into the water. He and Atreus get into it and sail away.]

Atreus: Huh. I still can't believe mom led a whole rebellion here, against Odin, and never talked about it.

Mimir: The fact that it didn't go well miiiight've curbed that notion.

Kratos: What your mother did before we met was her business.

Atreus: Did you ever ask?

Kratos: Eyes on the water. There are resources.

Atreus: If you never asked mom about what she used to do, what did you talk about when you met?

Atreus: Like, did you just say— (impersonating Kratos) "Woman, guard the house. I will go to catch fish in the river." And then leave for five days?

Kratos: No. Your mother was far better at fishing than I.

Atreus: Uhhh, did you see that over there?

Kratos: That wheel is blocking the channel.

Mimir: I imagine if you can turn it, we should be able to get through…

[They land on the pier next to which there are several stone buildings.]

Atreus: So these are "wetlands," huh? Pretty accurate.

Kratos: It is a bog.

Atreus: The smell is making my eyes burn.

Mimir: You know, it is a fair bit more potent than when I last visited, now that you mention it…

Atreus: Looks like the path continues on the other side of that geyser. Heh, if only we were in Midgard. That water'd be frozen in a second.

[Kratos finds the corpse of a dwarf and removes everything of value from it.]

Mimir: Looks to be an artifact from the Dwarven resistance. Hreidmar's brassard. Father of a few Dwarves you may be well familiar with. Brok may be interested in getting these back. Better in his hands than out in the open.

[HREIDMAR'S BRASSARD]
Hreidmar is known for two things: firstly, he was one of the great armorers of Svartalfheim.
Secondly, his sons are all dragons.
That's right - Hreidmar fathered the dragons you now know as Regin, Fafnir, and Otr. Wasn't a terribly good father, by any measure (unless you directly rate one's paternal ability to the amount of fire their sons can breathe, anyway), but damn if he couldn't make a good set of plate mail.
Odin wanted him to design the Einherjar's armor. Hreidmar obliged.
By "obliged," of course, I mean "built a fatal flaw into the armor that would cause the breastplates to snap like stale bread from the slightest blow."
About a dozen Einherjar died before the Allfather realized what had happened.
They caught Hreidmar trying to escape through a realm travel gate.
You can imagine what happened next.

[Kratos approaches the massive wooden structures.]

Atreus: Think that's sturdy enough to climb?

Mimir: Aye, good ol' Dwarven craftsmanship.

Atreus: Týr was a friend to the Giants. I wonder if he and mom ever met? If he was a part of the rebellion here?

Mimir: It's certainly possible, the god of war often advocated for the Giants, although I don't recall if he ever declared allegiance outright.

[They are attacked by several creatures similar to watermen. Fast and agile enough, they attack Kratos in a group. Picking up a shield he defends himself and attacks with his Blades of Chaos. Soon the monsters are finished.]

[GRIM]
The Grim occupy the voluminous middle berth in the life cycle of Svartalfheim's hostile gas-monsters. The "teenagers" of the species, for lack of a better word—violent, gassy teenagers. Among the most mobile denizens of the nine realms, the Grim can climb almost any surface, and burrow into the ground at disconcerting speeds-making them all too easy to lose sight of. Fortunately, they haven't developed the ability to fly. Yet.

Atreus: Nista!

Atreus: Okay, there's gotta be some way to turn the wheel up here.

[When they climb a massive wooden structure that serves as a bridge, a small earthquake occurs.]

Mimir: Woah there! Give a man some warning if he's about to suddenly end up snout-deep in—cheek.

Kratos: The ground…

Atreus: Was that an earthquake?

Mimir: Hm. An occasional, but not unheard of, happenstance in Svartalfheim. With all the mining here, the land's bound to be a wee bit bothered.

[Kratos throws his Blades of Chaos at the huge wooden water wheel and pulls the Blades to make it spin.]

Atreus: Oh, wow. Nice job getting it to lower exactly where we need it.

[After getting to the other side, they return to the boat.]

Atreus: I was thinking... because it's so warm, maybe it's not that the cold hasn't made it here yet but… maybe it's just different in Svartalfheim?

Mimir: Aye, lad. Fimbulwinter doesn't strike all realms quite the same way.

Atreus: Weird that Fimbul winter doesn't always make it... winter.

Mimir: In Midgard it does... but as you can see, the effects here appear far more... gaseous in nature. Observe the geysers; observe the aforementioned aroma. These effects were present before in some form, but now there's new extremity to them.

Atreus: Think we can fit under that bridge?

[Kratos and Atreus duck to swim under the narrow bridge. Once ashore they immediately engage in combat.]

Atreus: Nista!

Mimir: Wretch, left flank!

Atreus: Behind!

[After all the enemies are defeated, Kratos uses his Blades of Chaos to break open the metal plug on the geyser, which was bursting with steam.]

Atreus: Did they cap those geysers? Hm, I think we need to get that wheel moving, but the water doesn't reach.

[Next they will have another battle with Grim.]

Atreus: They're stunned! Grab 'em! Nista! Whew. Those things are everywhere.

[Kratos throws his axe into the geyser plug located in the distance and starts the water wheel.]

Atreus: Yes! The wheel's moving and the gate's coming down.

Mimir: That's Dwarven ingenuity for you.

Kratos: Back to the boat.

[They get in the boat.]

Atreus: If the Dwarves of this realm are anything like Brok and Sindri, it's hard to imagine them siding with Odin.

Mimir: Well... all too often, people are blinded to all but their immediate self-interest. Odin offered them safety, and defying him can be quite dangerous.

Atreus: Maybe they just need a couple of gods to come along and take the fight to him…

Kratos: Atreus, that is NOT why we are here.

Atreus: I was only joking.

Kratos: War is not a joke. Especially where gods are concerned.

Atreus: Yikes, this place is wrecked—and yes I AM staying alert. There are probably tons of those Grim around

[Kratos finds a large stone tablet on which a long text is written.]

[UNSAFE ROADS]
Careful, traveler—
This road leads to Niðavellir, sure, but so too does it lead to dangers beyond mention.
If you give a damn about your own safety, you will find an alternate route to the city of iron.
Should you succeed, find me, so I can spread the word of whichever route you took that didn't end with you getting your skin peeled off your body by something hungry and pissed off.
—Durlin

Mimir: Good thing you learned the runes, brother.

[Kratos searches the neighborhood picking up useful items.]

Atreus: I think that's everything here. Wanna get going?

[They get back on the boat.]

Kratos: It seems, Atreus, you intend to recruit Týr as an ally for war.

Atreus: I just... I'm trying to keep our options open. Let's just keep moving, I'm glad we're out here, exploring a new realm. Maybe… we could just try to enjoy the warmth? Looks like we gotta find a way to open that gate if we wanna get to Niðavellir.

[They land on the shore and see a small creature. Atreus tries to shoot the creature, but it quickly burrows underground.]

Atreus: Nista! It's too fast!

Kratos: Then how shall we catch it?

Atreus: Flank it. Attack from behind.

Kratos: Good.

[Kratos climbs the wooden outhouse and kills the little creature.]

[ORMR]
A mysterious creature. Mimir tells me it was born from an ember that escaped Surtr's hammer as he worked his forge. The steward of Muspelheim used his bellows to breathe life into the ember, and its first act of existence was to steal and consume the precious metals the smith had been using to forge a weapon. Mimir tried to tell me Surtr found this amusing. Were I Surtr, I would not be amused.

Atreus: Ha! You did it! Let's see what it dropped…

[They find a huge anvil hanging from a chain. The anvil blocks the way.]

Atreus: Father, up there.

[Kratos throws his axe at the chain, cutting it. The anvil rumbles down, clearing the passage. Then Kratos pulls on the chain to open one of the gates.]

Atreus: Halfway there. There's gotta be another chain to lower the rest of the gate. Look, there's a chain we can pull up there.

[They have to do battle with the Grim.]

Atreus: Nista! It's clinging to the wall, we gotta knock it down! Nista!

Atreus: Think you can uncover that geyser from here? Oh, THINK I get it. If you freeze the geyser, the pressure will turn the wheel. Hey, nice one. The block's coming down. Can you see anything from that block?

[On his way upstairs, Kratos finds a book lying on a bench. He looks at it as if he does not understand the purpose of the thing.]

Mimir: That's one of Kvasir's poems! Very highbrow. You should collect any others you find.

[THE SUNRISE OF NOTHINGNESS]
A story of relentless genius from the mind of Kvasir…

Imagine, dear reader, if you so dare 
Creatures of metal
That screech through the air 
That swim through the seas,
That bound cross the land 
But are brought to their knees 
By a warrior's hand 
Her origins, hidden
Her hair, red as blood 
Finding places forbidden 
Buried under the mud 
But who is this young girl? 
Who is more than she seemeth 
Who will rescue her people 
And slay these behemoths

[Kratos lowers the second chain fully opening the gate. He and his son return to the boat.]

Mimir: Lad, if I may, what exactly are you hoping to learn from Týr?

Atreus: Well, like I said, I was hoping he could tell me something about "Loki." I'd... also... like to hear some of his stories… traveling to other lands, Giant stuff, and… maybe about what it was like to fight back in the day, just for the history, obviously.

Kratos: History.

Mimir: Let's hope Týr's in a talkative mood after being imprisoned for so long. Not all of Odin's captives can be as charmingly voluble as myself.

Kratos: We have no proof Týr is truly here.

Atreus: Right. That earthquake earlier... do you think there'll be another one?

Mimir: It's unlikely. But, geological disturbances tend to be unpredictable.

Atreus: If the geysers and... smell... here are worse because of Fimbulwinter, maybe the earthquakes are too?

Mimir: Aye, you might be onto something lad.

Kratos: Atreus, look ahead.

[A view of a large village with wooden houses and a massive bridge in the distance opens up before us.]

Atreus: Wow. Now THIS looks like a city.

Mimir: Welcome to Niðavellir, brothers.

Atreus: Hey—Dwarves! Oh. They're, uh, running away.

[There is a metallic sound coming from afar.]

Kratos: An alarm.

Mimir: I'd only sound an alarm like that if I still had my body and was fearing the notion of being detached from it.

Atreus: Why all that for us though?

Kratos: They are scared.

Mimir: Most definitely an alarm, I'm afraid.

Atreus: Why is everybody hiding?

Kratos: Stay alert.

[They dock at the pier. Kratos pulls his Blades of Chaos from behind his back. Atreus approaches a nearby house and knocks on the door.]

Atreus: Hey! Could we talk to you for a—

Niðavellir Dwarf: We don't want any trouble... please.

Mimir: They'll be no help, to be sure. Best we find the tavern Sindri mentioned on our own. And hope they let us in…

Atreus: The buildings here really are incredible…

Mimir: The detail in the woodwork is quite extraordinary.

Atreus: Is that a statue of Odin? They must really love him here.

Kratos: Or fear him.

[They find Sindri's open-air store.]

Atreus: Sindri!

Sindri: Hello! I'd return your surprise, but I did know you'd be here… I've got something for you.

Kratos: What is it, Dwarf?

Sindri: You know, I'm glad I came back here at least once before Ragnarök. Oh, if these cobblestones could talk. Then they'd have mouths. Filthy, disgusting mouths… Do you mind if I fiddle with your bow?

[Atreus hands him his bow.]

Sindri: Ucch, you are long overdue for a replacement… Taking advantage of certain materials'—ow!—structural sensitivity to Sonic vibrations has been something—ugh!—I've been meaning to try for quite some time now.

Atreus: Thanks for, uh, finally trying it? What's it gonna be this time?

[Sindri tries to pull back the bowstring he removed, but he lacks the strength.]

Sindri: Patience! I find... it's best to see these things… oooh... in action... aaaah. Hooo! There.

[He gives the improved bow to Atreus.]

Sindri: Oh—take aim at that gate there, but before you loose, say… "skjálfa!" (Tremble)

Sindri: Skjálfa...! (Tremble!)

Atreus: Skjálfa! (Tremble!)

[He shoots the seal on the gate and it explodes, releasing some Grim.]

Atreus: Ah!

Sindri: Well, I certainly didn't expect you to disturb half the creepy-crawlies in Niðavellir.

Atreus: How was I supposed to know they were there!? Behind!

Mimir: Behind you, brother!

[Kratos and Atreus quickly defeat the monsters.]

Atreus: Okay. So. Durlin. Sindri, any idea where the tavern is?

Sindri: Do I look like I've ever been to a filthy tavern? The sewers you just punched a hole through seems promising, though. For you. It should lead to the other side of the city. It's not like you're able to open other doors around here.

Atreus: So this lockdown really is because of us?

Sindri: Oh, my, yes. Odin's grip on this realm is so firm, any outsider is considered a threat.

Mimir: Sounds like an Odin-ism if I ever heard one.

Mimir: Another of Kvasir's poems.

[LARGE SOCIETY GROUND ORB, THE PERFORMANCE]
Being a fictional poem by Kvasir, master of all poets...

The armies assembled 
Nine warriors strong 
Well-rested and fed 
For the war would be long 
The orb in the air 
And branches in hand 
A swing, a collision 
The spectators stand 
For nine nights and nine days 
They fight without rest 
Running, then waiting 
To prove themselves best 
Until finally, mercifully, 
The army does rout 
One army triumphant 
The other, struck out

[Kratos upgrades his equipment and that of his son.]

Sindri: 'Til we meet again!

[Kratos and Atreus climb into the sewer tunnel.]

Atreus: "Any outsider is considered a threat." Is that to protect the Dwarves?

Mimir: It sounds like it, but knowing Odin, there's sure to be an ulterior motive.

Atreus: Well... everyone's hiding on this side too.

Mimir: Odin's occupation of this realm has its hooks in deep.

Atreus: But there aren't any guards patrolling. We're clearly not a threat. Why hide?

Mimir: Resist and you're made an example of to keep the rest in line. Self-preservation can outweigh bravery for even the strongest of folk.

Kratos: Fear keeps them safe and alive.

[Kratos notices a strange piece of metal stuck into the wooden partition above him.]

Mimir: A firebomb. From the chief anti-Odin propagandist in Durlin's rebellion. Quite sharp wit she had until she turned to... less subtle means of resistance.

[GRIEP'S FIREBOMB]
I have many regrets concerning the time I spent in Svartalfheim. But of those regrets, I may think of Griep the most.
Griep was a fantastically angry Dwarven scribe. Her furious treatises against Odin's financial imperialism might well have spurred the Dwarves to outright rebellion, had she continued to distribute them.
As a wielder of words, she was at least my equal (if not my superior), and her passion and fury commanded the respect of anyone who read her writings.
When she took firebomb in hand and burned Aesir camps to ash, others followed her.
Unfortunately, the downside of having a clear and loud voice is that you're very, very easy to find.

[Kratos clings to a piece of metal left by the firebomb and climbs up. When he enters the square he notices a kind of pipe blocked by a wooden pole. He tries to throw an axe at the pole, but nothing happens.]

Atreus: I think we need some special equipment to use this.

[He again tries to appeal to one of the city's residents who has locked himself in his house.]

Atreus: Excuse me, but we're looking for—

Niðavellir Dwarf: Nothing for you here! I don't care what you want. No food, no encouraging words, no nuthin'. LEAVE!

[Atreus shoots at a cart loaded with stones, which blocks the path. The cart explodes, turning into dust.]

Atreus: Skjálfa! Oh, wow, Sindri wasn't kidding about the "structural sensitivity."

[Kratos pushes back the barrier and they enter a kind of open tavern. To the right are tables and barrels of liquor.]

Atreus: This looks promising, right? Less like a house... If he's here, maybe you should let me do the talking. 

Kratos: You?

Atreus: Well, we don't want to intimidate him. You're tall as a tree and you have a severed head on your hip.

Mimir: None taken! Fair point though.

Kratos: Very well.

[Kratos and Atreus enter the tavern.]

Atreus: Think that's him? Hello?

[They approach a mustachioed man with a small beard. He has a hoop on his head that keeps his long hair from falling over his face. His appearance is more Slavic than dwarf. He plays a kind of mechanical musical instrument by twisting the knob.]

Ræb: Watch yourselves, apparently there are "intruders" about.

Atreus: Oh... that's us, I think.

Ræb: Eh. Well, if you're plannin' on killing me, at least lemme finish this song. That alarm in juuuuuuuust the perfect key…

Atreus: We're just looking for a friend of ours. Named Durlin.

Ræb: Well, we both know that's not true. Durlin's got no friends left. But if that's all you need… Head out the back way there, and you'll see the safety office just across the river. Just don't go making trouble for the rest of us… And while you travel through this realm, maybe you could clean up the head's mess.

Kratos: What mess?

Mimir: Later, brother.

[RÆB]
The Dwarven proprietor of the tavern in Niðavellir. He was forthcoming with Durlin's location... and also with a bitter anger towards Mimir. His establishment is too small, and unwelcoming. I hope he is a better musician than he is a barkeep.

Kratos: I wish to hear of this... "mess."

Ræb: The rigs in the bay. Why don't you ask the condescending skull?

Mimir: Head. I've got skin. But... he's right. I made a mistake. I'd have us shut them down.

[Kratos goes outside through a door that is half his size and meets Sindri.]

Sindri: Sorry-one more thing. Although, these are gifts I'm giving to you so I shouldn't be sorry, and you should be thankful—anyways. Here. Please be careful.

[He hands Kratos a device which is a cube around which two copper rings rotate.]

Atreus: It's beautiful, thanks, Sindri.

Sindri: It is beautiful, isn't it? It's also very useful. You'll be able to find anything your heart desires with it.

Atreus: Really?

Sindri: As long your heart desires the locations your father and you decide and plot to travel together. Then yes.

Kratos: It is a compass.

Sindri: Ah, but a beautiful compass. Now scamper off.

[He runs away.]

Kratos: Come… a boat cannot be far.

Atreus: Huh. Earlier, Sindri made it sound like Durlin was some sort of rebellion leader. Doesn't sound like anyone's following him.

Mimir: "Was" being the key word here, little brother.

Atreus: I saw a dock back there, maybe there's a boat we can use to get to Durlin's?

[They get in the boat.]

Atreus: There's a building just past these rocks behind me. Maybe we should head that way.

Mimir: (sigh) Those bloody mining rigs...

Atreus: What about them?

Mimir: The skáld is right to blame me for them. They were my idea. If you've got the time, they're in the bay just beyond this tunnel. I'd particularly appreciate us checking out the mining rigs in the lake, to the right. You can see the smokestacks from here…

Atreus: But if you don't wanna explore now, it looks like Durlin's place is through that open gate to the left. So, which way do we go? We could prepare more before rescuing Týr. Up to you…

[Kratos decides not to leave unresolved affairs and settle Mimir's problem first.]

Favor: In Service of Asgard (start)
Atreus: Mimir, were you really the one who had those rigs built?

Mimir: Odin wanted the Dwarves under his control and, well... I convinced him he could buy their allegiance instead of demanding it outright. A trade agreement of sorts. A trade agreement of sorts.

[Approaching the shore, Atreus notices something.]

Atreus: What is THAT?

Kratos: Dead.

[They land on Dragon Beach.]

Atreus: That dragon sculpture's not bad…

[They engage in battle with monsters.]

Mimir: On your right!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Behind you!

Atreus: They're stunned! Grab 'em!

Mimir: Poison at your back!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

[Having defeated the enemies Kratos approaches the large inscription made in large runes on the board of one of the wooden fortifications.]

[DON'T BREATHE]
"Mind your breath"
Could be referring to the polluted air of the bay, or a warning against speaking ill of Odin. Both equally likely, in my opinion.

Mimir: Not the first time someone's told me that, I 'spose.

[Kratos and Atreus return to the boat and sail to another island.]

Atreus: I think I see something.

[They find Sindri's mobile store.]

Sindri: Taking a break before visiting Durlin? Very wise. He can be... a lot. By the way, if you're headed to the mining rigs in the bay, could you bring me any slag you find? I could use the material for my crafting. Nothing appeals to you?

[Kratos and his son get to the Watchtower.]

Mimir: No… it's still here?

Kratos: What?

Mimir: The island near the geyser—we need to get the key from it and unlock this door. We need—I need—to set right a very old wrong. Bloody Draugr holes! We've got to clear out all these undead bastards!

[They are attacked by a zombie named The Hateful.]

Atreus: You're on fire! But, you probably already know that. Skjálfa! They're stunned! Grab 'em! It's fast!

Mimir: Behind you, look out!

[Kratos uses his violent rage and beats the dead man with his bare hands. Afterwards he cuts off his head with Leviathan. The favor Born From Fire begins.]

[HERTHA THE HATEFUL]
I have never encountered a Draugr like this one before. It fights as if fueled by an infinite hate. It emerged from a scar in the earth that closed once we defeated the monster. If we encounter more of these holes, we must close them and put down any creatures that emerge.
Mimir has identified her as a former Empress, called Hertha. I do not care who she ruled over, I will put her back in the ground.

[Kratos and Atreus begin to descend lower.]

Atreus: What's behind the door?

Mimir: A prisoner. Of sorts.

[Along the way, they meet Sindri sitting in one of his myriad stores.]

Sindri: Greetings, boys!

Atreus: Good to see you!

[Without buying anything, they continue on their way.]

Atreus: One of the mining rigs is here?

Mimir: See the smoke above us? That's where we're headed. Let's see if we can't shut it down.

Atreus: Wow. There's a lot to explore here. Kinda nice to be out of Midgard for a bit, huh?

[They walk into Radsvinn 's Rig and are immediately attacked.]

Atreus: Skjálfa! Uph, Nightmares.

Mimir: Above you, brother!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: That's showing 'em!

[NIGHTMARE]
Nightmares, ugh! What awful pests. Entry complete.

[Kratos destroys several monsters living next to a huge furnace.]

Mimir: The rig's likely chockablock with materials that could help us. I'd grab whatever it spits up in the process.

[Kratos throws his axe at Odin's raven pecking the corpse in the distance.]

Atreus: That's one raven down.

[Kratos rips open the furnace door with a powerful blow and puts out the flames. The chimney stops smoking.]

Atreus: If the Dwarves AGREED to the deal with Asgard, why do they blame you?

Mimir: I talked them into their own exploitation.

Kratos: They made their choice.

Mimir: "Work or die" is not a choice. I only made it seem so. What you just picked up there is pure Svartalfheim ore... it won't be of use in the rig anymore, but perhaps our Huldra brothers could craft something from it.

Atreus: Father, is it always moral to kill something that's trying to kill you?

Kratos: Yes.

Mimir: Well, there you have it, lad!

Kratos: Atreus... You are getting better. Faster.

Atreus: Might even be better than you one day, huh?

Kratos: If you are not, I have failed.

Mimir: Aawww!

[Kratos and Atreus return to the boat and sail to the next furnace nearby.]

Kratos: How did these rigs come to be?

Mimir: I had them built to harvest ore for armaments, essentially harnessing resources that would otherwise go to the Dwarves.

Atreus: You think shutting these things down will help the Dwarves become independent?

Mimir: I don't know. But I have to try something.

Atreus: Mimir, how many stories have you told about Odin and Thor and all the bad things they've done?

Kratos: Enough. We will continue later.

[They land on the shore.]

Mimir: The key to that watchtower door should be on this island somewhere.

Favor: The Weight of Chains
Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Wretch on the left!

Atreus: Look, they keep coming outta that nest!

[Kratos defeats all monsters.]

Atreus: The ground looks weak down here, father.

[Kratos approaches the big wheel that controls the elevator.]

Atreus: That gear... looks like it would freeze.

Kratos: Hrmm.

Atreus: Maybe that lift can help us get higher. Might be easier to break that ground from up there.

[Kratos climbs inside the elevator.]

Atreus: Think you could break through the ground from up there?

[Kratos jumps down and with a powerful blow breaks the cracked stone slab and enters directly into the cave to a monster called Bergsra.]

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Right flank!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Wretch on the left!

Atreus: Behind you! Skjálfa!

Mimir: On your left!

[BERGSRA MOTHER]
It should come as no surprise that we despise Wretches. But what we despise even more than the little buggers is the thing that spawns them. If Wretches are born the way they smell, one can only imagine how much worse a bergsra "mother" is in the A olfactory sense. Worst of all, killing them has been known to set off an eruption of Wretches, rather than stave it off. Most unpleasant of creatures, the lot of them.

[Having defeated the troll-like monster, Kratos cuts it from stomach to head with a powerful blow of his blade.]

Atreus: Mimir, is this it? Over here?

[Kratos opens the massive sarcophagus and takes out the key to the watchtower.]

Mimir: That's the key we're looking for. Now, we must head to that watchtower on the shore.

Kratos: What are you not saying?

Mimir: I just… need you to trust me.

[Kratos and Atreus return to the boat and leave the island.]

Atreus: Back to Thor and Odin stories? Where were we...?

Kratos: Not now.

[They sail to Sindri's store.]

Sindri: Is that pure Svartalfheim slag? Give it here!

[Kratos picks up lost loot found by the dwarves.]

Mimir: Would've been a shame to have left that behind.

Sindri: Hey, what happened to all the armor we made you already?

Kratos: I used it.

Sindri: Well, maybe try to make this one last longer?

Kratos: I will not.

Sindri: Be safe!

[Kratos and Atreus begin to climb the nearest wall.]

Atreus: Can you hear that?

Kratos: No.

Atreus: Thought I heard a voice.

Mimir: Let's keep going, lad. Just put the key into that lock, brother. There. If you could give that drum a good, loud strike?

Kratos: Mm.

[Kratos picks up the broken drum mount, and Atreus shoots the drum with his bow. A powerful wave of sound makes the island in the distance move. The island makes a sound similar to the roar of a whale.]

Atreus: What?! So THAT's the voice I heard...

Mimir: I'd hoped it would've escaped by now, but... we'll need to free it from its restraints.

[Kratos and Atreus return to the boat and sail to the monster island.]

Kratos: What is this?

Mimir: A Lyngbakr. I captured it... many years ago.

Kratos: For Odin?

Mimir: Yes. I thought it an imaginative and... eye-catching way to earn his favour.

Kratos: It worked?

Mimir: That it did.

[They land on the island.]

Kratos: This creature. You enslaved it.

Mimir: Aye.

Atreus: But... WHY?

Mimir: Because I was young, and stupid, and I didn't know what it was like to be chained in one place for years at a time with nothing to occupy your mind but pain.

[Kratos and Atreus defeat several of the monsters that inhabit the island, after which Kratos cuts the thick rope mount holding the giant monster in place. Lyngbakr lifts his fin, which also happens to be chained.]

Mimir: Right. We chained the fins too. If you could...?

Kratos: Rrgh.

[He throws his axe at the chain cutting it.]

Mimir: Easy... easy...

Atreus: That creature's hurting.

Mimir: But we're going to free it.

Kratos: But it will always be chained. You know that as well as I.

Mimir: Now for the other fin. There may be a way to reach it behind that collapsed debris.

[They are attacked again by several monsters.]

Atreus Skjálfa!

Mimir: Above you, watch out!

[Kratos easily defeats them.]

Mimir: You're angry with me, aren't you, brother?

Kratos: I remember the feeling of a yoke around my neck. I would not wish it upon another.

[He finds another stone slab with an inscription on top of the mountain.]

Mimir: Anything illuminating?

[REGARDING THE REMOVAL OF RESOURCES]
1. When making your initial strike: Use an axe, not a pick. You use a pick, you go too deep, you get redflow. You get redflow, somebody has to clean it up.
2. Pre-dawn remains the best time to harvest. Grogginess and disorientation are still a major factor before the sun comes up. so the chance of accidents becomes much lower.
3. ALWAYS. WEAR. EARPLUGS.

Kratos: Why enslave the creature?

Mimir: Its fat was a good source of oil. For Odin's lanterns.

Kratos: Oil. For lanterns.

Mimir: Whatever anger you're feeling, whatever loathing toward me... it's nothing to what I've said to myself.

[Kratos cuts another rope mount.]

Mimir: The fin. If you could…

Kratos: I know.

[He throws his axe freeing the fin of the creature.]

Mimir: Just the tail left now.

Atreus: Look out! Wretch nest! The nest was hiding some sort of device... There's a dock down there, but it looks like it's blocked. Maybe that dock can lead us to the tail? Let's get back to the boat.

Kratos: You never spoke with this creature.

Mimir: Does that surprise you? That an old man would be ashamed of the mistakes he's made?

Kratos: No.

Mimir: More inspiring lyricism from the mind of Kvasir!

[WE WHO REMAIN, PART THE SECOND]
A dramatic poem by Kvasir, he of undisputed brilliance...

What is it to live? 
What is it to die? 
Is the only difference 
In the beholder's eye?
When disease rots your body. 
When hate sours your brain, 
What separates 
The mad and the sane? 
For the bearded, cruel father 
And his surrogate daughter 
Shall never know respite 
From a life full of slaughter 
The evil will die 
Along with the good 
And the difference between them 
Grows less understood

[Kratos and Atreus return to the boat.]

Mimir: I'd thought... I'd hoped the creature would be long expired by now. But apparently the Aesir couldn't even be bothered to mercy-kill it once it wa
longer useful.

Kratos: We could kill it.

Mimir: No. Not when we can save it.

[They dock at a part of the island near the tail. Kratos approaches a door with a massive mirror-like seal.]

Atreus: Father... look, we can chisel through this door.

[Kratos sticks a chisel into the seal and it crumbles. This artifact they found in the first game.]

Mimir: Oh, glad to see that still works!

[Behind the door turns out to be some useful items!]

Atreus: Nice, nice....

[They return to the boat.]

Mimir: (sighs)

Kratos: What is it, Mimir?

Mimir: It's nothing, brother. Just... you ever have those moments where you wish you could... go back? Rewrite your own past, make different decisions?

Kratos: Journeying through time is more trouble than it is worth.

Kratos: Ah. Fair point. You're speaking metaphorically, right? Good. We can reach the tail from this dock.

[They land on the shore.]

Kratos: You would still save this broken creature?

Mimir: I know what it is to be imprisoned like this. I can just leave it.

Kratos: And if it is beyond saving?

Mimir: I don't understand.

Kratos: Let us continue.

Atreus: They're stunned! Grab 'em! Behind you, look out! Skjálfa!

Mimir: Behind you, poison! Left side, brother!

Kratos: This is the last!

[Having finished with the monsters, Kratos cuts the rope mount and the monster-isle lifts its tail.]

Mimir: Its tail must be chained as well. Sliding down that rope should take us where we need to go…

[Kratos finds a place from which he can throw his axe. He frees Lyngbakr.]

Mimir: There you're free!

Mimir: What's going on? Maybe it needs a little encouragement. Can you get me close in eye for a face-to-face, brother?

[Kratos finds a kind of diamond-shaped stone panel. He tries to touch it, but nothing happens.]

Atreus: Yeah, I don't think we can do anything with that yet…

[The heroes sail to the face of the monster island.]

Atreus: This creature. The mining rigs. They're mistakes, Mimir, but it's Odin's fault.

Mimir: That's not an excuse, little one. But thank you for saying it.

[Kratos sails his boat up to the giant eye.]

Mimir: Go on, you great blubbering beast! Shoo! It's not moving. Why is it not moving?

Kratos: It has grown accustomed to its chains.

Mimir: But—no. No, we can fix this.

Mimir: We just need to chase it off, scare it! Something…

Kratos: There is no making things right. Only better than they were.

[Lyngbakr douses them with splashes of water.]

Atreus: It likes the wind blowing on its face. I can feel it.

Kratos: May it provide some comfort.

Mimir: But... that's not enough.

Kratos: It seldom is.

[THE LYNGBAKR]
It appears that Mimir has enacted many cruelties here in Svartalfheim. None more reprehensible than chaining this creature and harvesting its fat for oil.
To perform an act so heartless and to put it out of one's mind, to never speak of it... It reminds me of a boat captain I wronged long ago. He too was robbed of his freedom and suffered because of who I was and the choices I made.
Perhaps there is a measure of monster inside us all.

[THE WEIGHT OF CHAINS favor completed!]

Favor: In Service Of Asgard (continue)
[Kratos and Atreus sail to the second smoking chimney.]

Atreus: Okay, what other terrible things have Odin and Thor done… Okay, there was Thamur, the stonemason.

Mimir: Aye… he quarreled with his son, went into the night to find him, found Thor instead.

Atreus: And there was Thamur's son, Hrimthur.

Mimir: ...who built the walls of Asgard, and whispered something of importance to Freya before his betrayal and assassination.

Atreus: There was Gróa, of course.

Mimir: The knowledge keeper, and prophet of Ragnarok! Thor murdered her husband, and Odin covered it up before doing her in himself.

Atreus: We can't forget Ymir, the first Giant.

Mimir: Odin carved him up to form the realms from his body, and let the torrent of his blood, nearly drown every Giant alive.

Atreus: What about the Giants of Jötunheim? They all seemed dead when we finally made it there.

Mimir: That remains a mystery. Though admittedly, it sounds like the Aesir gods' dream.

Atreus: What about Fjörgyn? Thor's mother was a Giant, wasn't she?

Mimir: Indeed she was. The circumstances of her demise were murky at best. But not sure I can blame Odin for that one. He wasn't the same after.

Atreus: Oh, I know there was Skaði, the Queen of the Hunt.

Mimir: Aye... she spurned Odin's affections, so he tricked her into killing her father.

Atreus: There was... Starkaðr the Mighty, the Jötnar military leader...

Mimir: Slandered by Odin, tricked and murdered by Thor.

Atreus: And there was... Thrym the Cunning, The Giant king who stole Thor's hammer.

Mimir: Odin traded him Freya to get it back, then sent Thor in disguise to murder his entire court.

Atreus: Who else? Ah! Hrungnir the Brawler! The stone Giant.

Mimir: Aye... mocked by Odin, murdered by Thor.

Kratos: Enough of this.

Atreus: But there's more!

Kratos: I do not care. War with Odin is not the answer.

[They dock at Althjof's Rig.]

Mimir: There's another mining rig on this island, brother. Smell that smoke?

Atreus: Why would the Dwarves agree to work for the Aesir in the first place?

Mimir: That's the heart of it, eh.

Kratos: You lied to them.

Mimir: We never do seem to get rid of those things…

Atreus: Bet we could swing across that, uh... lift… thing.

Mimir: Gantry!

Atreus: Gantry. Thanks! That's gotta be the right spot.

Mimir: Those barrels... I smell fuel. Bet a spark from your blades would cause quite a boom.

Atreus: I think we could break through the ground here... if you found a high enough to drop from… Surprised the Dwarves didn't shut these rigs off themselves.

Mimir: One or two tried. The Einherjar made examples of them.

Atreus: They killed the Dwarves? Couldn't you have convinced them not to?

Mimir: Aye.

[Climbing up, Kratos jumps onto the cracked wooden floor and breaks through it. Beneath him are several zombies and a board inscription.]

Mimir: Huh. Impressive.

[THE SQUASHER]
"Kaðlín, Squasher of Wretches, killed a nest of twenty here"
A legend or boast I wonder? I wish this Kaðlín was around to enlighten us with her strategies.

Atreus: They're stunned! Grab 'em! Skjálfa!

Mimir: On your right! Left flank!

[Kratos breaks down the second furnace and stops the flow of smoke.]

Mimir: (heavy sigh)

Atreus. You okay, Mimir?

Mimir: To the blacksmiths of Svartalfheim, the creation of a weapon was a sacred thing. But Odin just wanted as many blades as he could get, as fast as he could get them. With every stolen resource and mediocre blade, the Dwarves lost a bit of themselves.

Kratos: The Dwarves survived because of you.

Mimir: You're not wrong there, brother... Odin would have wiped out every last Dwarf in Svartalfheim. If he couldn't use their skills, no one could.

[Kratos finds a scroll.]

[PASSION]
It's incredible what they take from you.
I used to love mining. Reaching into the hardened earth and pulling out its fruits. Filth under my nails, the stains of the realm's blood smeared on my clothes. I'd take my bounty home and hammer it into something beautiful. Something that was MINE.
Now I do it for you. For the Aesir. Now I do it because you'll beat me if I don't. The beatings I can handle. Flesh heals.
But you took my passion. Every day I wake up and I dread doing the very thing that once gave me purpose.
So. That's it for me. I'm going to fill a pack with my greatest works of metallurgy, and I'm going to walk into that gods-forsaken bay. Whatever awaits me in Helheim can't be worse than doing this every day.

Atreus: Mimir—what do you think is means, seeing more Raiders come back as Hel-Walkers lately? I thought freeing the Valkyrie Queen was supposed to restore balance to the realms, and keep that from happening.

Mimir: That's good question, lad, and a troubling one. If Hel's filled up again, it suggests that something's been hindering Sigrun's efforts—or perhaps something even more urgent is keeping her distracted. And unable to visit. Even occasionally.

Atreus: Yeah… Sorry, Mimir.

[Kratos and Atreus return to the boat and sail to Alberich Island.]

Atreus: HELLO? Huh. Seems abandoned.

Mimir: Brother, you ever think of cooking meat with those blades of yours?

Kratos: No. They would foul the meat.

Mimir: Oh, because of the magic on them?

Kratos: The blood.

Mimir: Ah, yes. Carry on then.

[Kratos sails to the next island, where Modvitnir's Rig is located.]

Atreus: Smell the smoke? There's another mining rig here.

Kratos: You speak of your deeds with shame. Do you regret not allowing Odin to kill them?

Mimir: I don't... (sigh.)

Atreus: I don't get it. The Dwarves weren't chained up like the Lyngbakr. Couldn't they quit?

Mimir: And do what? Their newly built forges poisoned the soil of Svartalfheim. Unable to grow their own food, they had to buy it from Asgard. If they stopped working, they'd be taking food out of their own mouths.

Atreus: Oh. That's clever. And awful.

[Kratos finds half of the Yggdrasil seed.]

Atreus: Whoa. An Yggdrasil Seed to Muspelheim. Think it might lead to that combat arena we visited years ago?

Kratos: What makes you say that?

Atreus: Wishful thinking, I guess. Going through Surtr's gauntlet... it was fun.

Kratos: It was training.

Atreus: You DIDN'T have fun?

Kratos: Mm.

Atreus: Well anyway, we should look for the other half of the seed. Once it's whole again, we can see where it leads.

[The Crucible begins. Kratos finds the last third furnace. There are still quite a few strong monsters guarding it.]

Atreus: Skjálfa! They just keep coming!

Mimir: It's a bergsra! Spawning her little Wretches like there's no tomorrow.

Kratos: For her it will be so.

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Right side, brother!

Atreus: Behind! Behind you, incoming!

[Having defeated the monsters, Kratos breaks the last furnace.]

Kratos: It is done.

Mimir: If you could call so meager a task "done"... a wee drop out of the Asgardian occupational bucket.

Kratos: You must live with your deeds, but do not be troubled by them, brother.

Mimir: Oh? And why not?

Kratos: You were given an impossible problem. Do not blame yourself for failing to solve it.

Mimir: I'm sure the Dwarves would feel differently. This doesn't fix things.

Kratos: No. But it is a start.

[IN SERVICE OF ASGARD favor completed!]

The Quest for Týr (continue)
Mimir: A reminder, brother. That Svartalfheim slag we collected could be of considerable use in the hands of Brok or Sindri.

Atreus: Father... what's the biggest, thing you've ever fought?

Kratos: I do not know.

Atreus: You can't remember?

Kratos: Why do you ask?

Atreus: I dunno. So we can compare?

Kratos: It is not a competition.

Atreus: I mean… not yet.

[Kratos and Atreus return to the boat.]

Atreus: The air smells a lot cleaner. Must be 'cause we shut down the rigs. We going to Durlin's? Hope he'll be happy we fixed those rigs.

[They land on a pier by a small house with a waterwheel.]

Atreus: This... is the safety office? 

Mimir: Well, the sign a hair's breadth away from a head injury up there certainly gives that impression.

[Kratos opens the door and enters the house. It seems empty rather dark. Only a few candles saturate the darkness. The house itself inside looks more like a warehouse.]

Atreus: We're looking for Durlin?

Durlin: You have an appointment?

Atreus: Uh, no? Has anyone ever had an appointment here?

[The dwarf sitting at the counter drops the large book he was reading. The one-eyed and rather chubby dwarf in the skullcap evokes the feeling of a cunning and calculating man. He smiles broadly at the sight of Kratos.]

Durlin: Here to collect on something, pal? Think parading a severed head around on your hip is gonna scare me into somehow approving Estrid's accretion proposal, eh?

Kratos: We are looking for a prisoner of Odin's.

Atreus: He's being kept in a mine somewhere. Some friends of ours said that you could help.

Durlin: Where did you get...? You chop her head off with that too, eh?

[Kratos can barely contain his anger.]

Kratos: She was my wife.

[The dwarf clicks his tongue and a tamed octopus climbs on his arm.]

Durlin: Dínner and I... wondered where she went after our little coup here failed.

[He pours himself some kind of drink into his mug.]

Atreus: Failed?

Durlin: Yeah, come... come.

[The dwarf points to the scar on his forehead.]

Durlin: Failed.

[Kratos slams his fist on the counter.]

Kratos: Faye is dead.

Durlin: The best of them are. Ones left alive have to pay the price. I'm afraid I can't help you with your little "prisoner" situation.

[He begins to put things in order in his store.]

Atreus: But... he could have answers on how to stop Odin… ...and free Svartalfheim from the Aesir.

Durlin: I'm not in the business of crossing the All-Father anymore. Wait! Before you go… Take this.

[He writes something on the scroll and stamps it with his fist.]

Atreus: What is it?

Durlin: A fine. Hygiene code violation for improper transport of a rotting head. Two demerits for speaking the All-Father's given name… ...and, uh, yeah… (yells) For fucking up my desk!

Atreus: A fine?

Durlin: Pay it at your leisure, okay? Get out of my office.

Atreus: Hey there.

Durlin: So what about "get out of my office" don't you understand?

Atreus: You said her name was Dínner?

[The octopus is splashing around in his aquarium and throwing something at Atreus.]

Atreus: Oh, uh, sure. Thank you, I think?

[They go outside. Atreus scrutinizes the scroll he has received.]

Atreus: Hey, this isn't a fine.

Kratos: Not now, there are enemies ahead.

Atreus: Skjálfa! They're stunned! Grab 'em!

Mimir: Right side!

Aureus: One left! Okay... as I was saying... I think Durlin wrote down directions.

Kratos: The Dwarf has given us a map.

Atreus: Sort of... uh, you smelled him… but it seems to lead to a mine beyond that mountain…

Mimir: Ahhh…

Atreus: Týr. Durlin helped us anyway.

Mimir: Not everyone uses axes and arrows to fight.

[DURLIN]
A minor official of the Dwarven city, Niðavellir. At one time, an ally of Faye's in an effort to resist Odin. Now, he numbs his failures in drink. Yet it appears he has aided us with a map to Týr's location. Also, his sea-creature, Dínner, gave Atreus an unusual stone.

[Kratos and Atreus walk out to the mining railroad tracks on which a train is placed.]

Atreus: This thing looks like it can take us up the mountain. Maybe we'll be able to see a mine up there?

Mimir: Ah, nothing quite like a Dwarven drain ride. We can take that train up the mountain when you're ready, brother.

[Kratos and Atreus sit inside a small car clearly not designed for human height. The train turns out to be automatic and it starts moving.]

Mimir: Heimdall... there's a name I don't miss hearing…

Kratos: No one said it until you did just now…

Mimir: Durlin! He didn't need to say it, brother, it was written all over his face, er, well, burned I should say. Into his head.

Atreus: He burned that into Durlin's head?

Mimir: Failed rebellions tend to warrant swift and enduring retribution.

Kratos: He is a captain of Odin?

Mimir: Aye, and the bearer of Gjallarhorn. A true believer, that one. There are few things so dangerous in a man as lack of doubt…

[The train stops. They arrive at The Forge.]

Atreus: Seems like we're here. C'mon. This way I can see another train. Let's look for a way to get over there.

Atreus: You know... maybe finding Týr is our best protection. Seemed like Odin really didn't want us to find him. Once Týr's free and can be god of war again, Odin won't have time to worry about us.

Kratos: If that is his war to fight, he may have it.

[In one of the boxes Kratos finds a blue orb, shackled with iron.]

Kratos: A bomb?

Mimir: Deactivated, but yes. Likely one belonging to Bari the Dwarf, builder of the great hall Lyr.

[BARI'S GRENADE]
Bari the Dwarf spent his entire life building the great mead-hall known as Lyr. Brick by brick, stone by stone, he built it as wide and as tall as he could so that the songs and merriment of the Dwarves could echo within its walls until the end of time.
He was only a few days' work from completing it when the Einherjar arrived. They demanded Lyr's use as a temporary barracks.
That same night, Bari the Dwarf hurled stone grenades at the cornerstones of his life's work. Collapsed the entire bloody thing on top of himself in a matter of hours.

[After passing through a small ravine, they find a dragon lying on the shore. He seems to be dead.]

Atreus: Whoa, is that a dreki? What happened here—?

[He runs to the corpse.]

Kratos: Use caution.

Atreus; I think it's dead. Yep, definitely dead. Hey wonder if—

[And then another dreki comes out of the water!]

Atreus: Father, look out!

Kratos: Atreus!

[A fierce battle begins!]

Atreus: Skjálfa! The tail, watch out!

[Protecting himself from blows with his shield, Kratos tactically attacks the monster with his axe and then when it runs out of air grabs its crocodile jaws with his hands and tries to tear it apart, but fails. Instead, he simply holds the monster down.]

Kratos: ATREUS!

Atreus: Ready!

[Atreus quickly shoots the monster in the head several times.]

Kratos: Your knife!

[He cuts the monster's throat with his knife.]

Atreus: Together!

[Father and son stick their knives into the head of dreki.]

[DREKI]
I must confess responsibility for the dreki that roam Svartalfheim. Odin ordered me to disrupt Svartalfheim's natural ecosystem in an effort to push the Dwarves towards industrialization. I knew these apex predators, a variant of Dragon native to Vanaheim, would wreak havoc on the Dwarvish ecosystem. What I did not know is just how effective they would be—the complete extinction of several native species, and an imbalance that will take lifetimes to undo. Consider this a written confession, and a pledge to do everything in my limited power to set things right.

Atreus: That one was tough.

Kratos: Stay on your guard there could be others around.

Atreus: Think that dreki is what killed the first one we found?

Kratos: If so, it was their aggression that got them both killed.

Atreus: Down there. I can see a mine. That has to be what Durlin was talking about.

Mimir: Tracks up on the left there. Might be another train we can take...

Atreus: Father, what if a war with Odin isn't just Týr's to fight? What if it's ours too?

Kratos: War is not the only way.

Atreus: We're gods. Better gods. We're trying to stop Ragnarök, to help people, and if the only way to do that is war?

Kratos: Atreus.

[They approach the entrance to the mine. Kratos finds a scroll.]

[DEAR OVERSEER]
Dear Overseer:
It is with shame and sadness that I must report I will be unable to meet your requested quota for this season. I am simply unable to forge armor of the quality AND quantity you have requested.
The fault for this, of course, is mine. alone. I very much hope that my awareness of this fact might incline you to show some degree of leniency: as it stands, my output has measurably reduced since the injuries I sustained after previously failing to meet your quota, and I would argue-respectfully. as always that further physical punishment would only further harm my productivity.
I eagerly await your response.

[Kratos finds another inscription made on a board.]

Mimir: "Forge Ahead"... pun intended, I imagine…

[THE FORGE]
"Forge Ahead"
Could be a lighthearted jape, or another expression of the Dwarves' resentment of Odin's grip on Svartalfheim. Is progress truly progress if made under an oppressor?

[The heroes find the train tracks again, but the train is off the rails.]

Atreus: Looks like we have to get this one back on the tracks.

[Kratos cuts off the freight wagon attached to the train and throws it off the mountain. He then puts the train back on the tracks with his mighty arms. Atreus jumps onto the train to help align it to the rails.]

Atreus: Wow, this thing is small... okay, we need to go left. Wait, I meant my left. Keep going… We're so close, just a little to the left. That's WAY too far, Mimir, tell him LEFT. Hm, hopefully that's it. Yeah, that's it! Round two, here we go. Wheneeeeeever you're ready.

[They board the train.]

Kratos: The kraken hatchling gave you a stone.

Atreus: Kraken...? Oh, uh, Dínner? Yeah it's covered in algae. I was thinking we could show it to Brok and Sindri when we got back. Here…

[He throws the stone to his father.]

Atreus: Okay, so, we came here looking for Týr because we don't trust Odin, right? It think about it, war could—

[Something jumps onto the roof of the train.]

Atreus: Uh-oh.

[Grim's creepy face appears in the window. Kratos pummels it with his fist.]

Atreus: On your left!

[After that it quickly switches to another window.]

Atreus: Your right!

[The third Grim jumps on Kratos from behind and strangles him with his long tongue.]

Atreus: Tell me when!

Mimir: Atreus! Look for a brake to stop the train! Should be a lever of some sort!

Atreus: Found it! RRNNNG! The brake's stuck!

Mimir: Keep trying, little brother!

[Kratos, meanwhile, fights several Grim with his bare hands.]

Atreus: Father!

Kratos: Stop this train!

Atreus: I think... it's about to—AHHK!

Kratos: No!

[A powerful flow of steam rips out the brake handle, and it flies out the window. The wagon goes off the rails and falls. Kratos and Atreus struggle to stay inside.]

Atreus: Shit. Shitshitshitshitshiiiiiiit.

[The train is falling somewhere.]

Atreus: OOF.

Kratos: NGH.

[Quickly rising to his feet, Kratos breaks down the door with his hands.]

Kratos: Get up.

[A huge hand grabs him.]

Kratos: Gah!

Atreus: Father! A troll?!?

[Jumping onto the train, Kratos cuts off the head of a huge troll with several powerful blows.]

[DAUDI VÖRÐR (DEATH GUARD)]
We encountered this troll in Svartalfheim on our mission to find Týr. Atreus and I were fortunate that this creature had positioned itself perfectly to break our fall. In gratitude, I put it out of its misery.

[TROLL]
Ah, the sweet scent of a troll... mead and an elk carcass fermenting in the same barrel in the steamiest of Svartalfheim swamps. At the very least, they're easy to avoid, given their spoor and disregard for the art of stealth.

Atreus: I can't believe we survi—are you serious?!

[They are attacked by several Grim.]

Mimir: Behind you!

Atreus: That was crazy. All of it.

Mimir: You said it, little brother.

[Atrey breaks through the entrance to the mine with a powerful shot.]

Atreus: Skjálfa!

[They are attacked again.]

Mimir: On your right! Left flank! Aye! Give 'em what for!

Atreus: This place is incredible.

[Kratos finds an interesting object in one of the chests.]

Mimir: The whetstone of the Night Ripper. When resisting an occupation, sometimes most obvious methods are the best.

Kratos: It is old. No longer of use.

Mimir: But enough about you—I'm talking about the whetstone.

[LOFNHEID'S WHETSTONE]
There's something to be said for creeping around at night, slitting the throats of your enemies. It's quiet, it's effective, and it's fear-inducing.
There are many ways to rebel, but that was the method Lofnheid chose. It worked for quite a while, too. The Einherjar never believed the adorable tavern waitress who served them with a twinkle in her eye and a smile on her lips could also be the one butchering them come nightfall.
But butcher them she did. Got eleven of them before she was finally caught.
And even when they executed her, they said she had that same twinkle in her eye. That same smile on her lips.

Atreus: I think I see a passage... if we can get through this ore.

Mimir: So... quite the mouth you had on the train, lad.

Atreus: It's just a word. I've heard WAY worse from Br—

Kratos: The word does not matter. You lost control.

Atreus: We were falling. Through the air. I thought we were gonna die.

Kratos: Is that what you truly wish your last word to be?

Atreus: No.

Kratos: In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you.

[They go out to Jarnsmida Pitmines.]

Atreus: Look on the ground. Tracks. These must lead into the mine. We'll need to get this cargo…

[Kratos throws his axe in the counterweight lowering the weight obstructing the passage.]

Atreus: That's it. Let's head across.

Mimir: Good bet there's a couple more near here. Let's find 'em, yeah?

[They continue their journey through winding paths littered with a variety of technological devices made mostly of wood.]

Atreus: I might be able to get up there if you help me.

[Kratos pushes his son up and he climbs on top of the wooden structure.]

Atreus: Great. I'll head across for a better look… Father, there's a gate up here heading towards the entrance to the mine. If you can get up here, I'll need your help lifting it.

Kratos: If...

Atreus: Oh, c'mon, you can jump that, your knees aren't that bad.

Kratos: Atreus.

[However, he continues to mock his father spitelessly.]

Atreus: I hope you can make that jump.

[Kratos goes to Atreus by lifting the various mechanisms that get in his way.]

Atreus: It's another one of those wooden troughs. I wonder how the Dwarves thought stuff like this.

Mimir: Aye, might be the Great Motivator of convenience. Why do the work when you get the wet stuff to do it for you?

Atreus: Sure hope Týr's here.

Kratos: Atreus, we seek information.

Atreus: I know. Stop acting like I'm trying to start a war.

Kratos: Yet you do not say otherwise.

Mimir: Brothers. Maybe we can lay this to rest a bit, eh?

[Kratos approaches the metal gate separating him from his son.]

Kratos: You lift on your side, I will lift on mine.

Atreus: Hnng. Heavier... than I thought…

Kratos: Hng.

[Atreus manages to pull such a huge thing off the ground, which already seems to be a divine act. Kratos, on the other hand, lifts the gate with ease.]

Atreus: Thanks. Let's keep moving.

Mimir: Hm... maybe you can hit it from a different angle? Looks like we found Durlin's mine entrance.

[Kratos pushes aside a huge cart obstructing the march. Behind the cart he finds Sindri.]

Sindri: Got something else for you…

Atreus: Sindri!

Kratos: What is it?

Sindri: Since you're currently lacking a light source—sorry—and have no way of seeing exactly what untold horrors lurk in the dark, these will help.

[He holds out to both of them a ball of metal shackled and on a rope.]

Sindri: Okay back to your exploring now, off with you.

Atreus: Thanks, Sindri—hey wait, what do you mean by "untold... horrors...?"

[They are attacked by several Grim.]

Atreus: Skjálfa! (Tremble!) Look out! It's clinging to the wall, we gotta knock it down!

[The monsters are defeated.]

Atreus: That was close!

[Kratos redirects the flow of water triggering the mechanism that moves the crane.]

Atreus: Whoa. Are you seeing this? That huge crane's moving this way.

Kratos: Stay there.

Atreus: Yes, sir. Meet you on the other side!

[Kratos sets out again on a little solitary journey.]

Kratos: Mimir, what is the likelihood Týr is imprisoned in this mine?

Mimir: Ehh, Durlin might've been as well-oiled as this crane, but I don't believe he'd lead us astray. You think the lad's too trusting?

Kratos: He is eager to prove himself. It clouds his judgment.

Mimir: Oh, I know you have more faith in him than that, brother.

[Kratos finds another Kvasir’s poem.]

Kratos: What became of Kvasir?

Mimir: Ripped apart by his audience. Well—one member of his audience. Well—Thor.

[TOOL AND BANG]
A story of brotherhood, by one Kvasir...

Steel and fur
Unlikely friends 
United in purpose
To heroic ends 
Thrown together by fate 
Ripped apart by disdain 
Old foes to aggravate 
New allies to obtain
Saving world after world 
With friends at their backs 
Two clever automatons 
And the last two—

(The manuscript abruptly ends here, the bottom of the page singed beyond recognition.)

[Kratos returns to his son.]

Atreus: Find anything?

Kratos: We keep moving.

[They enter a vast cave, lit only by a few holes in the ceiling.]

Atreus: I think this is it. This is the mine. Well, looks like the official entrance to the mine is blocked. But there's gotta be another way. Maybe this cave'll get us in?

Kratos: This way.

Atreus: Nice. Not a dead end… c'mon, let's see where this goes.

[They kill some Wretch.]

Atreus: Skjálfa! (Tremble!) Where are they all coming from?

Mimir: It certainly smells like we're headed into a mine.

Atreus: I think I can hear the water too…

Kratos: Slow down, Atreus. Take care. Be ready.

[In the distance they see a giant Bersgra.]

Atreus: So, I think I found where those Wretches were coming from.

Kratos: They will overwhelm you quickly, stay close.

Mimir: Behind you, watch out!

[Kratos kills the troll by beating him with his fists and thrusting his Blade multiple times.]

Atreus: She's dead. Now to take care of the rest of these things. Phew. That's all of them. Ugh, the smell these things leave behind is so gross.

Kratos: A small consequence for disturbing their home.

Atreus: Let's keep moving.

[They climb into a small boat with which to move ore through the mine and float downstream.]

Atreus: I'm sorry. I know you said not to... but I can't stop thinking about this. We spend all of our time fighting bad stuff, and I don't get why we can't do that alongside Týr.

Kratos: We do not know him.

Atreus: We saw his shrines! He's a leader—he stood up to Odin when no one else would. If he's done it before, why wouldn't he do it again?

Kratos: Images from long ago do not tell a whole story.

Atreus: There's a door. Once we get off this, let's check there for Týr. He's gotta be close. I can't help but feel like you're angry with me or something. Ever since we got to Svartalfheim, you've been critical of my every move. If you don't think I can lead us, just say so.

Kratos: It is not your competence that is in question.

Atreus: Okay... but what does that mean?

Kratos: Consider your intent.

[From the depths of the mine, several bats fly out at them. They get into the Applecore.]

Atreus: Whoa. This place is huge. Must've taken ages to build… Another door. We'll have to check that one too.

Kratos: Durlin's instructions do not say which one.

Atreus: Nope. We're on our own here. Your question from before—about my intent. I intend to help the god of war stop Odin, and that means freeing him from whatever prison he's in right now.

Sindri: Brace yourselves, friends!

Atreus: Sindri?

[Their boat bumps into several wooden beams lying in the water.]

Mimir: Oof.

Sindri: And be careful exiting that thing. One foot at a time. There are loose, rusty nails everywhere.

Atreus: Have you seen any signs of Týr?

Sindri: As if I would navigate this maze of running sewage? No. I'm sure you'll manage that on your own.

Mimir: I dunno, the water looks pretty clear here…

Sindri: Keyword: "Looks."

[After replenishing supplies and upgrading his equipment, Kratos and his son continue their quest.]

Atreus: Look, there's a door just across this gap. Týr could be right there.

[Next to the suspended wooden bridge, Kratos notices an inscription made on the wall.]

Mimir: Whoever wrote this certainly had an eye for detail…

[THE VAULT]
"Vault vista"
Don't know what to tell you. Not everything's got a thrilling story behind it. Sometimes people just label things exactly what they are.

Atreus: That worked. Let's get to the door—c'mon.

[Kratos opens the massive wooden door.]

Atreus: Týr?

Mimir: Well, I certainly don't think this is where Týr currently is.

Atreus: He, he's gotta be here somewhere. This mine is huge.

Kratos: Atreus, what do you intend to stop Odin from doing? You speak as if you know his plan.

Atreus: I don't know his plan. That's why we're—

Mimir: AHEM. Brothers. With Fimbulwinter underway and Ragnarök around the corner, Odin will be desperate. Whatever he's planning to do surely won't be to the benefit of anyone but himself.

Atreus: Exactly.

[He breaks the stone barrier with a powerful shot.]

Atreus: Skjálfa!

[Kratos and Atreus continue to explore the mine.]

Atreus: Across the way. There's another door. Maybe that's the one.

[They find another stone tablet covered with runes.]

Atreus: Huh. Glad we explored.

[COOPERATION]
We built this realm with our Dwarven hands. Reinforced it with Dwarven muscle. Innovated with our Dwarven minds.
But we no longer have to do it alone.
Our strength and ingenuity has finally found an equal in the Aesir of Asgard.
Now, Dwarven smiths will work hand in hand with Aesir soldiers and engineers.
Now, Aesir backs will share the burden with their Dwarven brethren, lightening the load for us all.
It was Dwarves who made Svartalfheim what it is.
But together with the Aesir, we can make it into something even better.


Atreus: How many doors ARE there down here?

Mimir: Not to be discouraging... but it is a mine, after all.

Atreus: Mimir? That is discouraging. Uhhh, did you see that over there? There's a broken door up to the left behind this crane. Maybe Týr tried to escape? We should look.

[Kratos pulls a lever switching water currents that lift the gigantic elevator.]

Atreus: Huh... there we go! I think that should keep the lift fully powered up. We're almost there.

[However, Kratos decides to go the other way.]

Atreus: Wait, where're you going?

Kratos: We will return.

[They pass under a narrow partition and enter a circular room with a Bersgra and some Wretch on the far side.]

Atreus: There's another door. Let's beat these guys and check there.

Mimir: Poison at your back!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Above you, watch out!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

[Without much effort, Kratos defeats the monsters.]

Mimir: The door now, shall we?

Atreus: Wonder where this leads.

[They enter the room, but it turns out to be empty.]

Kratos: Another dead end.

Atreus: I don't think we can go this way.

[After searching the room, Kratos finds a statue.]

Kratos: A statue. Made for the Aesir?

Mimir: Indeed. And then stolen by Althjof the Thief.

[ALTHJOF'S STATUE]
I recall Althjof the Thief's antics. He understood one of the most important rules of resistance: you don't always need to win major battles. You just need to inconvenience your invaders.
Before Svartalfheim voluntarily bent the knee to Asgard, Odin sent a detachment of Einherjar as a gentle show of force.
There wasn't a day that went by where I didn't hear about missing bags of grain or pilfered armor. Or, in this case, treasured valuables stolen away before they could be returned to Asgard.
Unlike most thieves I've known, he stole not for the thrill nor the payoff, but simply to irritate the Einherjar.
And it worked!
Until they laid a trap for him, caught him, and hanged him with a length of rope he'd been attempting to steal.

[Kratos and Atreus return to the elevator.]

Mimir: Outstanding. That overflowing water is powering the crane. Clever. We'll be up there in no time.

Atreus: That's it. C'mon, let's take that lift up. Týr can't be far.

[Kratos slides the doors of the elevator with his mighty arms and they go inside, going up.]

Atreus: Okay, new exercise: Let's think about how Týr's probably feeling locked up in this mine. If I were imprisoned by Odin and finally freed? Odin would obviously be at the top of my list, but I would just want to fight something. Anything. Even if it was just to know I still could.

[Kratos opens the door and they go inside.]

Atreus: Týr? Whoa, what happened here?

[Týr's supposed dungeon has collapsed. They are immediately attacked.]

Mimir: Wretch, left flank!

Atreus: Target down.

Mimir: Behind you, brother! They certainly weren't Týr. Best look around.

[Kratos examines the room and finds a corpse of a dwarf who is covered in stones. There is something in his hands.]

Atreus: This Dwarf didn't make it out. Is that a relic? Huh.

[Atreus finds a crack in the wall.]

Atreus: I feel a breeze. We might be able to get out of here this way. Another empty vault...

Mimir: Little brother, perhaps it's time we—

Atreus: No. Don't even say it. We're gonna find him. Look! Another door on the other side of the cavern. Let's go.

Mimir: I do believe we're above where we got off the boat by Sindri. This mine is one enormous spiral...

Atreus: I think I can hear something in there…

[Kratos finds the last item in the Things Left Behind set.]

Kratos: A statue.

Mimir: Not just any statue... that stoney visage hung over the entrance to the World-Mill. Built by Durinn the Generous.

[DURINN'S STONE STATUE]
Durinn the Generous built the World-Mill over the course of decades. He foresaw a future in which Svartalfheim was as lush and verdant as the most overgrown fields in Vanaheim, and the World-Mill was the first step toward that future. He'd sell fertile, high-quality soil to the other Dwarves and pour all the proceeds into keeping the World-Mill running.
When Odin heard of this miraculous machine and the independence it might one day grant Svartalfheim-he offered Durinn gold beyond measure to destroy it. Durinn refused.
Odin wanted to bring the whole structure down, of course, but I convinced him to steady his hand. Instead, Asgard simply made their OWN World-Mill. We sold our own soil to the Dwarves at prices Durinn couldn't possibly match. He couldn't afford the upkeep on his miraculous machine, and so it fell into disrepair.
Once Durinn's World-Mill broke, Odin destroyed Asgard's as well.
Durinn took his own life shortly thereafter. 
And that is the story of how Svartalfheim almost gained independence.

Mimir: I believe that's all of the rebel artifacts. We can return them to Brok whenever you're ready.

[In the depths of the mines they find another place with scorched earth.]

Mimir: Another Draugr hole, brother.

Aureus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Draugr on the left!

Atreus: You're on fire! But, you probably already know that.

Atreus: Behind you, Father!

Atreus: Skjálfa! It’s fast!

Kratos: That Draugr...

Mimir: Aye. We fought it at the other Draugr hole, didn't we? Odd.

Atreus: That's not what I was ready for. Another dead end. Where could he be?

Kratos: Atreus, this mine is largely abandoned. It is unlikely—

Atreus: Týr's here. I know it. Durlin's directions stopped at the entrance to the mine. We just have to keep searching until we find him! You said you'd follow my lead, and I say we keep looking. So knock it off.

Kratos: Watch yourself. I will follow, but I state what I see. You need not agree with me, but you will. Not. Speak to me this way. Are we clear?

Atreus: Sir.

[He opens the next massive door and they continue their search. Kratos tries to lift the chain to get to the other side.]

Atreus: What happened? Why didn't that work?

Kratos: The chain is blocked.

[Atreus shoots his bow at the stones on the chain.]

Atreus: Skjálfa! Should be clear now.

Atreus: Ready when you are. One more door. That one has to be it.

Kratos: We will see.

Mimir: Seems like we'll have to get to it first.

Atreus: We've used water to power the wheels before, worth a try.

Kratos: Climb across and look for another way.

Atreus: I think I see a crank over here.

Kratos: Atreus, another mental "exercise."

Kratos: Would one who spends their life fighting, such as Týr, have any desire to prove themselves? The “proof”... leaves a wake of destruction.

Atreus: But if the "wake of destruction" is a bunch of bad guys, why does that matter? You're strong AND you did the right thing.

Kratos: War does not measure the strength of a man. I hope one day you understand.

Atreus: Okay it looks like this machine is dropping ore into the water trough. Skjálfa!

Mimir: Well, that didn't quite work. Something else we can do?

Atreus: Think we could freeze the ore to help us? Skjálfa! Hey, we did it. I'll meet you at the door. This could be it. We still have to go back and check out that last door, right?

[There is a small earthquake.]

Mimir: Oh, tell the ground to be still.

Kratos: Hmph.

[He lifts the giant metal partition.]

Mimir: This looks familiar. We're back in the spiral section of the mine.

[Eventually they enter the last room of the mine and it turns out to be empty.]

Atreus: Damn it—

Mimir: Did you hear that, brothers? I don't think we're alone.

Kratos: Ears open. Eyes up.

Atreus: It came from over here. There's a passage leading out.

Kratos: Atreus, do my words irritate you?

Atreus: It's fine. I get it.

Mimir: Brothers, wait... is that light up ahead there?

[They go into a small circular room at the far end of which there is a massive wooden door, but this door is metal-clad and has a heavy wooden deadbolt.]

Atreus: Hey, this might be it. That door's barred. They MUST be trying to keep something in.

Mimir: You don't lock a door like that to secure the spare bedclothes.

Kratos: I see what we must do.

[He approaches the door and draws his blade to cut it, but he hears a scream coming from somewhere above.]

Einherjar: Hvat er at gerast?! (What's going on?!)

[Two warriors with pale white skin and a bare torso jump down to them. The warriors have Roman-like helmets on their heads and a magic mace in their hands.]

Aureus: Skjálfa! They're stunned! Grab 'em!

Mimir: Behind you, watch out!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Einherjar, left flank!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Bifröst? Tread carefully, brother.

Atreus: Skjálfa!

[Defeating skilled warriors is not easy because in contrast to the animals they know the tactics and attack thoughtfully. But they are no match for our Spartan.]

Atreus: Clearly they don't want us in there. This HAS to be it.

Mimir: Back to it, then…

[Kratos stabs his Blades of Chaos into the deadbolt and pulls it as hard as he can, breaking it down along with the iron-clad door. It rumbles and falls, raising a cloud of dust. When the dust clears, Atreus notices a man with a long black beard sitting in a small room. His head is lowered - he has clearly lost the will to live.]

Atreus: Týr...!

Týr: What trickery is this, Odin..? What game do you play with me now?

Atreus: We're not with Odin. We're the good guys.

[Kratos approaches Týr from behind, unceremoniously grabs the rope he is tied to and cuts it with his Blade of Chaos, heating it.]

Kratos: This... is the god of war?

Týr: Those blades… I know you… God-killer… Have you come for me now?

Kratos: Only to free you.

[Kratos holds out his hand, but Týr backs away.]

Týr: Stay away!

Mimir: Brother, let me try… 

[Kratos removes Mimir's head from his belt, which was previously out of Týr's sight.]

Mimir: Týr! Týr... look... you know me, don't you?

Týr: You… You killed Mimir!

Mimir: No, no, no no...

Atreus: Yeah, we... we brought him right back!

[Týr gets up and runs away quickly.]

Týr: You... stay away from me, you monsters!

Atreus: Stop! We need him!

Kratos: Wait!

[Atreus runs after Týr, and Kratos is attacked by three Einherjar. In the process of fighting them, they and Kratos fall to the level below.]

Mimir: Left side, brother!

Atreus: (from afar) Týr! Wait! We’re friends! Please! Just listen to us! We're trying to help you!

Kratos: Atreus!

Atreus: This way! Cut him off!

Einherjar: Hættu! (Stop!)

Mimir: I'm about to get knocked around a bunch, aren't I? Right side, brother! Behind you, look out! Behind you, incoming! That's the last of them. Let's find your son.

[Atreyh and Týr, tired from a short run, are not far away.]

Atreus: Týr, it's okay... it's gonna be okay…

[Kratos slowly approaches Týr.]

Týr: Just... leave me alone...

Atreus: Týr, listen, I swear we're not here to hurt you. We're just trying to get you out...

Týr: Get away from me... please, I beg you... show mercy...

Atreus: Take you somewhere safe, away from Odin. This is my father. We... help people.

Týr: I don't belong out here. Please. It's worse when he's angry.

[Kratos grabs Týr by the shoulders and lifts him off the ground, pushing him against the wall. He speaks menacingly and loudly.]

Kratos: Are you not a soldier? Are you not a leader of men? Master yourself! My son brought us to this place. For YOU. Look at him!

Týr: You? Why....? You don't know me.

Atreus: I know what you stood for. You helped the Giants. We're returning the favor.

Týr: “We?”

Kratos: WE are leaving. Are you coming with us?

[Týr nods affirmatively. He stands up to his full height and we realize that he is two heads taller than Kratos, though not as muscular.]

Atreus: Here! Your statue in the lake... you had a spear. I thought you needed a w—

Týr: ...walking stick? No… ...a kind thought, but no, thank you, no...

Atreus: But… Okay.

[He kneels down in front of Atreus and puts his hand on his shoulder, as if to apologize for the stupidity of what he has done.]

Týr: I, uh… I, I ran because I don't always know what's real. Eh, sometimes... there's a... I, uh...

Mimir: There's no shame in that, brother. We live in strange times.

Týr: Everyone hears him talk?

Kratos: We must return home.

Atreus: Can you feel that? A wind… blowing from over here. Maybe there's an exit nearby.

Týr: Are there names by which I should call you?

Atreus: I'm Atreus. You already know Mimir. And that's my father, Kratos.

Týr: How does the son of a Spartan come to speak for the Jötnar?

Atreus: My mother was the last Giant in Midgard—Laufey?

Týr: Laufey… I remember that name.

Atreus: She tried to help people too. She's in The Light of Alfheim now...

Týr: You have my sympathies—

[There is a small earthquake.]

Týr: Oof.

Atreus: Are you okay?

Týr: These are just much stronger when you're not sitting down…

[When they get to the elevator, it turns out to be a little elevated.]

Týr: Please, let me get that. It's the least I can do.

[He grabs the giant elevator with one hand and lowers it effortlessly.]

Atreus: Whoa.

[They go inside and go up.]

Týr: Why risk Odin's wrath to free me?

Atreus: Well, Ragnarök is coming— I hope you knew that… We thought you'd wanna help.

Týr: You... freed me only to start a war?

Atreus: No! Um...

Mimir: Ahem. So, Týr, it's good to see you in the flesh again.

Týr: Mimir... what's become of you?

Mimir: Following in your footsteps: betrayal, indefinite imprisonment, execrable torture at the hands of the All-Father...

Týr: You didn't deserve such treatment.

Mimir: Did you? I will say my view was a touch better than yours.

Atreus: We found him at the top of a mountain with tree roots wrapped all around him! The only way to free him was to... well, that.

Mimir: Highly pleasant. For all parties involved.

[The elevator takes them outside and the bright sun hits Týr's eyes for the first time in a long time.]

Týr: Ah!

Atreus: You okay?

Týr: The light, it's... it's been so long...

Atreus: There's an outcropping just ahead, the shade'll make it easier on your eyes. C'mon.

[They get to Sverd Sands.]

Týr: You said Ragnarök is coming… which means Baldur—

Kratos: Baldur is dead.

Mimir: Odin sent him to track down a Giant in Midgard. And then he found Kratos... Anyway, I'd promised to take these two to the tallest peak in the realms if they'd chop off my head and convince Freya to bring it back—

Kratos: Mimir. Speak of Baldur.

Mimir: I was getting to that! It wasn't all kill this, kill that.

Atreus: Hey—we're back in the wetlands.

[There are several Grim jumping out of the water at them.]

Atreus: Watch out!

Týr: No. No nо nо nо nо.

Atreus: Ah, uh, it's okay. I've got you.

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Mimir: Behind you, brother!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

[Kratos and Atreus defeat the creatures while Týr is hiding somewhere.]

Kratos: Come, we must leave before more creatures attack. You should have taken the spear. Defended yourself.

Týr: No... I have abjured all violence.

Atreus: But... you're the god of war!

Týr: I left that behind long ago.

Atreus: If Odin starts Ragnarök? You… really wouldn't fight?

Týr: Not even if I wished to.

[They walk out onto a pier with a boat mounted on it, moving on a chain. Kratos drops the door with a kick.]

Týr: Before we go any further… the truth. What is it you want from me? You speak of Ragnarök. Is it a god of war you came to find? Is that the Týr you need?

Kratos: Atreus?

Atreus: I...

Týr: Forgive me, I am grateful for my freedom. But if you want me to follow you to war… Or worse yet, lead you to it? Then kill me now. My fight is gone. Damage is done.

Mimir: No one's killing you, brother.

Týr: Better that than to live to see Ragnarök.

Kratos: We do not seek war.

Atreus: We just want some answers.

Týr: I don't know how to help you.

Atreus: It doesn't matter. The Giants trusted you. That's the Týr we need. We need you.

[Týr ponders the answer for a minute.]

Týr: Alright. All I ask is for a good night's rest. And maybe some food. I think you killed the guards bringing me dinner.

[He gets up and helps Kratos pull the chain that moves the boat.]

Mimir: Brother, perhaps now you'd like to finish the story?

Kratos: Hm. The sons of Thor attacked us. We killed them. Baldur tried to kill Freya. I killed him.

Atreus: But you skipped over how we fought and freed the Valkyries, and that the Giants are all gone, and how they called me "Loki," and finding the shrines, and—

Týr: The Giants are gone?

Atreus: When we got to Jötunheim... they were all… dead.

Týr: Dead? Do you think Odin...

Kratos: We do not know.

[They notice several warriors flying in the distance, surrounded by streams of purple magic.]

Mimir: I think we're getting out of here not a moment too soon.

Atreus: Whoa.... what are those?

Týr: Reinforcements from Asgard. The Einherjar will want to investigate my disappearance thoroughly.

[Kratos and Týr begin to move the boat faster.]

Atreus: Are they using the sky to travel between realms?

Mimir: Odin's got tricks up his sleeve we haven't dared to consider.

Atreus: They're coming down on Niðavellir too. Will the Dwarves be okay?

Kratos: The time for such concerns has passed. We must leave. Now.

[They disembark and run to the portal. Their path is blocked by Einherjar.]

Atreus: Look out!

[TÝR]
Of the myths and legends Mimir has unfolded to us, none have so inspired Atreus as the life of Týr. Once the god of war in these lands, he dedicated himself to peace. A hero not only to mortals of Midgard, but to those of the far-off lands of other pantheons, to which he traveled in the name of diplomacy. Even the Jötnar revere him it is believed his aid is what made the Giants disappear, escaping Odin's wrath (at least for a time).
I am not certain he will prove as useful to us as Atreus hoped, either as a leader or as a source of information. Though perhaps, with patience, he will recover himself. Most importantly, he seeks neither war nor revenge for the suffering visited upon him. In this, I am grateful.

[After defeating the warriors, Kratos opens the portal. The heroes go to the inter-world.]

[QUEST FOR TÝR completed!]

Týr: Yggdrasil! It's been too long. I'd forgotten… the beauty…

Atreus: Týr? In your travels, did you ever hear the Giants talk about Loki?

Týr: I'm sorry, that name doesn't sound familiar… The Giants are... were... a very private people.

Atreus: Makes sense.

Týr: Perhaps after a rest—

[They pass through another portal to Sindri's house.]

Týr: A... tree house.

Sindri: Lord Týr! You're really alive!

Týr: Am I? I wonder...

Sindri: Oooookay.

Atreus: He's just tired. I promised him some food and a room to rest in.

Sindri: Ah! Of course you did. Well. Let's see what we can do. Please, come inside...

Atreus: Uh, we'll be right in!

Brok: (from the house) Well, I'll be!

[Kratos is also about to go inside, but Atreus stops him.]

Atreus: So... can we talk? About what to do next?

Kratos: There is much to consider. We will speak in the morning.

Atreus: Oh. Okay... in the morning.

[Kratos enters the house. Brok is standing on a table with a hammer in his hands. Next to him stands Týr.]

Brok: Hold still, hold still… YAA!

[He knocks the collar off Týr's neck with a blow of the hammer.]

Týr: Much better, thank you...

Atreus: See? Sleep tight, Týr. I'm gonna turn in. Big day tomorrow...

Sindri: So! Týr! Sounds like promises were made. Let's see about getting you settled shall we? If you'll follow me…

[Kratos approaches Brok.]

Brok: Hey! Come see what I got for ya! I'm sure we won't be interruptin' any goings-on.

Sindri: I may need time to construct a bed for someone of your scale…

Brok: So that's what's left of Týr, huh? Back where I come from, we'd say he's been through a few things.

Kratos: Mmm. So have we all.

Brok: Well, ain't you filler-sophical.

[Kratos upgrades his equipment.]

Sindri: Alright... uh... some food, then?

Týr: Oh, nothing much. Perhaps some hardtack?

Sindri: Hardtack?

Týr: Any sort of humble ship's biscuit will do.

Sindri: I…

Týr: With a pinch of salt?

Sindri: Well… I'll see what I can find. Know what? They must be in the pantry. I'll just look quietly.

Brok: You got some slag from the homeland, huh? Hand it over—I'll fix you up somethin'.

[After Kratos finishes with his equipment, he goes to the storage room to talk to Mimir. He puts his head on a barrel.]

Mimir: What are you thinking, brother?

[Kratos closes the door quietly.]

Kratos: I am thinking… I want things to be the way they were.

Mimir: Well... I'd like to climb a tree again. Certain ships have sailed.

[Kratos stands at the window, turning his back to Mimir to prevent him from seeing the emotion on his face.]

Kratos: I just wish Atreus were not so… ...restless. I care only for his safety.

Mimir: I know, brother. But holding him too tight won't keep him out of danger. The lad's determined to make a few mistakes of his own… And I hate to say it, but I think Týr might be one of them. I've never seen a man broken so completely.

Kratos: His pain is fresh. You expect too much.

[Atreus, meanwhile, is quietly eavesdropping at the window.]

Mimir: Aye, perhaps… Pity Freya still wants to kill you. That's an ally we could use...

Kratos: That is not an option.

Mimir: No, I don't suppose it is.

[Sindri sneaks up on Atreus.]

Sindri: (whispers) Trouble sleeping?

[Atreus falls to the ground in fright.]

Atreus: Aah! Shh! 

[He takes Sindri aside.]

Atreus: You cannot sneak up on me like that. There's something I have to do in Midgard.

Sindri: W-without me? I thought we were partners.

Atreus: We are! Just… ...wasn't sure you'd wanna join me. I'm visiting... an old friend.

Sindri: Oh. I see. OR, possibly NOT doing that, taking into account she's determined to murder you.

Atreus: She wouldn't really.

Sindri: Look, I think it's lovely that you see the best in people. I really do. And I want you to continue to see the best in people, by not getting yourself murdered.

[They spot Brok in the window and hide.]

Sindri: (gasp)

Atreus: But we need her. It's worth the risk.

Sindri: Is it though? How about I suggest an alternative—something much less risky, but maybe could give you some answers?

Atreus: What are you talking about?

Sindri: A certain old friend you haven't seen in a while. A very giant friend.

Atreus: Jörmungandr? Did you find him?

Sindri: Why don't I show you? It's just on the way to the vengeful goddess who wants you dead, so it'll give us some time to decide about not going there!

Atreus: So... you know where Freya is!

Sindri: No! NOO! I mean yes, but... look, let's just talk to the snake first, and THEN I won't take you to Freya. How's that sound?

THE PATH: Old Friends
[Atreus opens the portal between worlds and enters it.]

Sindri: Glad you brought your Key of Yggdrasil. I seem to have dashed out without mine.

Atreus: Heh. You got sick of having houseguests THAT fast?

Sindri: What? No. I could just use some fresh air, is all.

Atreus: Well, I hope you like it cold...

Sindri: Should we swing by your cabin first? Will your furry friend be joining us this time?

Atreus: Oh... no, I meant to tell you… Fenrir's dead..

Sindri: Oh. I'm very sorry to hear that. As wolves go, he was always... very clean.

Atreus: Thanks.

Sindri: I'd offer to give you a hug, but… ...why traumatize either of us further. 

[They pass through the glowing portal on the other side and enter snow-covered Midgard right on the shore of Lake of Nine.]

Sindri: Okay... caught a whiff of something awful near the Helheim tower. Remember how to get there?

Atreus: Yup, just past the oarsmen. But... that's what makes you think Jörmungandr's nearby?

Sindri: I know what I smelled.

Atreus: Okaaaaay, well, a lot's kinda happened. And I need answers.

[Not far from him is a chest that he often encountered on his way when he traveled with his father.]

Atreus: A chest! RAA!

[He tries to open the chest with a punch like Kratos does, but the lid doesn't even crunch. Atreus only damages his fist.]

Atreus: AHHHHHH!

Sindri: Not so easy, huh?

Atreus: Shut up.

[He smashes the lid with his bow, then destroys the seals on the gate with a few shots.]

Atreus: Skjálfa!

[He and Sindri walk through the resulting hole.]

Sindri: So what's been going on?

Atreus: So... Father said I cast a spell when Fenrir died. But I don't know what he's talking about.

Sindri: Accidental magic? That is disquieting...

Atreus: Accidental magic's not all. I sort of... turned into a bear.

Sindri: A bear? Including the slobber?

Atreus: Yeah. But I lost control. Freya knows magic better than anyone. She could help me.

Sindri: But not Giant Magic…

Atreus: Fine. We'll do it your way then, Sin. A huge venomous snake seems much safer.

Sindri: It's... venomous...? Shoot the barrel. It's got Soundstone on it, too.

Atreus: Skjálfa!

Sindri: YES! Feels good right?

Atreus: It's great, Sindri. No way I'm lifting that. Maybe with some help?

Sindri: Don't look at me. Who knows where it's been?

Atreus: We're blocked. How'd the arm of Týr's statue end up here?

Sindri: Find a way through, and I'll tell you. Huh. Looks Dwarven…

Atreus: I'm on it. Skjálfa!

Sindri: It is Soundstone! But the path's still blocked... and I don't see any more on this side.

Atreus: Hold on, let me look around. Maybe I need a different angle.

[He climbs a small ledge and approaches the dilapidated boat blocking the passage from the other side. With a shot from his bow he breaks the seal.]

Atreus: So Týr's arm?

Sindri: Your father owed Thor a—blood... payment. And well, he got it

Atreus: Wow. Great story.

Sindri: Anyway, is that likely to happen again? Sudden uncontrolled bear rampage?

Atreus: Beats me!

[They crawl under the boat and find several enemies on the other side that they have not yet engaged in battle with.]

Atreus: We've got company. Got my back?

Sindri: They're literally made of filth. I'm not touching—

Atreus: Who said you need to touch them?

Sindri: I like the way you think. Okay, here goes nothing.

[The battle begins! Atreus tries to keep his distance from his opponents and shoots at them with his bow and only comes to them for the final blow. The opponents prove to be far more numerous than Atreus had hoped for...]

Atreus: Down. A little help would be nice!

Sindri: That's some quality craftsmanship! Uh. Ok. Right... I'll just…

Atreus: Skjálfa!

[After a few minutes of grueling combat, they win.]

Atreus: Thanks for sacrificing so many objects from your bag of tricks.

Sindri: Well, you clearly need the help.

Atreus: Oh, whatever!

[They approach the stone elevator.]

Atreus: Shoot. I think the lift switch is broken. You can fix it, can't you? Or does your brother have all the talent after all?

Sindri: Depends. Is your father all the muscle?

Atreus: If I say yes, you realize you're confirming Brok has all the talent.

Sindri: (sighs in worried frustration) There! Let's get going!

[Atreus turns the elevator gate and it begins to rise.]

Atreus: Why are you worrying so much today?

Sindri: I just need to look out for the people I care about. Keeps bad things from happening to them.

Atreus: Freya wouldn't kill me, and Jörmungandr's probably not even there. Besides, he likes me. He's only eaten me once.

Sindri: I had conveniently scrubbed that from my memory.

Atreus: Well, we're here.

[They come out to the area where the horn used to summon the World Serpent. Now everything around is covered with snow or ice.]

Atreus: Told you he's gone.

Sindri: Well, have you tried calling him?

Atreus: Blowing the horn's the first thing we tried.

Sindri: I'm not talking about the horn.

Atreus: Yooooooor-moooooo-taaaaay-oooom! Seh-nooooo!

Sindri: That's not weird at all.

Atreus: Sshhh....

Sindri: Oh... Oh... ah, ah, aaah…

[A huge block of ice next to them crumbles - it turns out to be the frozen World Serpent. It looks at them with its huge serpent eye and begins to rise up, breaking the ice. Atreus pushes Sindri away so the block doesn't fall on him.]

Atreus: Move!

Sindri: Oh—

[Sindri snuggles up against Atreyu's leg. The icefall ends. Jörmungandr turns to Atreus and begins to say something. His voice shakes the mountains and sounds like the roar of an ancient monster, which it is.]

Atreus: Looo-kiii-yaa… Fiimbuul-aakkataa. Leeeeggjaaa-fyriiiir.

Atreus: Iron wood? What is that??

[He decides to check with the World Serpent.]

Atreus: What is that?!

[The World Serpent says something back to him as he turns around and walks away.]

Atreus: That's all you're gonna say?! Well, don't let us keep you up or anything!

Sindri: Good talk.

Atreus: Iron wood… What do you think it means?

Sindri: Means we should have stayed home. Let's head back.

[JÖRMUNGANDR]
We haven't seen Jörmungandr since Fimbulwinter began—I was beginning to think he'd left the Lake of Nine, somehow... but Sindri's nose was right! The World Serpent woke up when I called, but when I asked him about Loki, and what I should do, all he had to say was "Járnvior." Not. Helpful. No idea what "Iron wood" means, but it was still nice to see him again.

[They approach a massive metal door richly decorated with drawings of men pulling in different directions.]

Atreus: Door's frozen. Maybe I can—ha! Agh!

[He tries to open the door first with his hands and then tries to pry it open with his bow.]

Sindri: Would you just let me do it? So what was your plan, anyway? Just stroll up to the old Valkyrie council circle and hope Freya's in a good mood?

Atreus: Well, now that I know where she is, yeah, exactly what I'm gonna do.

Sindri: Fuck!

[Sindri opens the door.]

Sindri: Don't tell Brok I cursed. He's unbearable when he's smug.

Atreus: Look Baldur tried to kill her. We had no choice.

Sindri: Not sure she sees it that way.

Atreus: Well, I'm not gonna ask her. Besides... they were your arrows.

Sindri: You're absolutely right, which is exactly why I'm recommending we don't do this!

[They are attacked again.]

Sindri: AH!

Atreus: Skjálfa! Down. Örva ýta!

Sindri: Well THAT'S quite enough excitement for one day…

Atreus: No way. We're so close!

Atreus: Skjálfa!

[After defeating the opponents they come to a high ledge from which they have to jump.]

Sindri: Oh dear. Maybe this is a sign…

Atreus: Don't be a baby. I'll catch you. Promise not to drop you this time.

Sindri: I....

Atreus: Fine. Just step between the realms then!

Sindri: You know it doesn't work that way! Though sweet Bestla I wish it did.

[He gathers his courage and jumps. Atrey catches him.]

Atreus: See? Was that so bad?

Sindri: I sincerely hope I never have to do it again if that's what you're asking!

Atreus: (sighs)

Sindri: My shop! Well, if I can't stop you, then... this is as far as I go. I'm gonna stay and... fix this.

Atreus: Suit yourself.

Sindri: You sure you want to go in there wearing the very arrow tip that killed her son?

Atreus: I'll hide it under my shirt. And besides, it's a reminder. To be better.

Sindri: You need a murder weapon to be a better person?

Atreus: It makes me feel brave, okay. Is that such a bad thing?

Sindri: When it leads you to believe you can convince Freya of anything, yes, it is.

Atreus: I have to try.

Sindri: Hit the fire pot!

Atreus: Sweet.

Sindri: Sweet.

Atreus: Just keep going…

Sindri: Are you sure this is a good idea? You haven't got a plan!

Atreus: Brok says some people run better on chaos. I think he's right.

Sindri: What makes you think that applies here? This is life and death!

Atreus: And this is Ragnarök! We can't just do nothing and we're out of options.

Sindri: Living! Living is an option!

[Atreus continues his journey alone.]

Atreus: Okay, now which way to the council? As long as I go up and forward, I think I'll get there eventually. Yeah, sounds right…

Он в одиночку сражается с мертвецами…

Atreus: Got 'em. Skjálfa! Alright, more Soundstone… Skjálfa! Man, if Father could see me now... he would lose it. I wouldn't have to hide things if he'd just trust me… (as Kratos) How can I trust you if you lie? Actually, that's a good point… Maybe if you listened to me. (as Kratos) Could I not say the same? Well, where do you think I learned it from!

[He is being attacked.]

Atreus: Örva ýta! Skjálfa! Got 'em. Skjálfa! Gotta keep going up. Wonder what mom would do? Why don't you trust her? Why won't you tell me? Guess I'm going the right way. Really wish I had a compass.

[He enters the fray again.]

Atreus: Skjálfa! Down. Skjálfa! Örva ýta! Skjálfa! I got this, right? Yeah, I got this. Freya shouldn't be much farther now. Just need to look out for that big door…

[He goes out to the snow-covered mountains and arrives at the same place where he began his journey, but much higher. He is spotted by Sindri.]

Sindri: Is that you up there?

Atreus: Hello down there!

Sindri: Hey! Come to your senses yet?

Atreus: Yes! I mean-uhh... I'm not changing my mind.

[Atrey is making a snowball. He has a choice of either throwing it at Sindri or throwing it away.]

Sindri: Hah! You do have doubts! HEY!

Atreus: Like you never do? Better than having regrets.

Sindri: I'm not sure I agree with that... But by all means, keep going and you might find those too!

Atreus: Yup. That's the door.

Sindri: Just be sure to scream if she starts killing you.

Atreus: Thanks. I feel so much better now!

[He goes on thinking about how he will talk to Freya.]

Atreus: "Hey, Freya. What—can't I pay an old friend a visit? Nothing wrong with that, right? I mean, just because I'm responsible for the death of your son doesn't mean—" Okay, yeah, I should probably avoid mentioning that. “What's that Freya? Why am I wearing this around my neck? The arrow tip that killed your son? That's a great question. Uh…" I'm so dead.

[He notices his old acquaintance sitting by the blue fire, sharpening her sword. He hides the arrowhead hanging from his neck and approaches the fire.]

Atreus: Here goes nothing.  Freya.

Freya: You should have stayed with Sindri.

[Arteus' hands are wrapped by a vine, grown right out of the frozen ground.]

Atreus: Wait! Stop!

Freya: Your father—where is he?

Atreus: Not here.

Freya: He sent you?

Atreus: No. He doesn't know…

Freya: You shouldn't have come. He took my son. What makes you think I won't do the same?

[She puts her sword to Atreus' throat. She has a rather mad look on her face.]

Atreus: You're better than this.

[Freya removes the arrowhead from Atreus' neck with her sword.]

Freya: You would stake your life on it? What do you know of me?

Atreus: I know you haven't killed me yet. So while you're thinking it over, why don't you let me go and I can tell you why I came?

Freya: If you mean to plead for your father, save your breath. His fate is sealed.

Atreus: But you know who's to blame for everything...

Freya: I cannot get to Odin. Nor do I need to. Ragnarök will take him.

Atreus: Yeah? Well, what if I told you that he came to Midgard? He came to us. Offered peace if we don't move against him. Claims Ragnarök's already been averted.

Freya: He lies.

Atreus: Maybe. But if you know Gróa's prophecy, you know it depends on an army of Giants.

Freya: The Giants wait for war in Jötunheim.

Atreus: No. I've been there. There is no Giant army. There are no Giants at all. Just me. 

[Freya releases Atreus. The vine goes underground.]

Atreus: In Jötunheim we learned the truth. My mother was the last guardian of our people in Midgard. And—and that's not all. The Giants have prophecies about me. They know me as.... Loki. I think maybe I'm supposed to help stop Odin, somehow. But since all the Giants are dead, and you won't fight Odin.... ...then he's already won. Why aren't we working together? Now that you can fight again—

[Freya abruptly and rudely cuts him off.]

Freya: I am far from whole…

Atreus: Okay. Okay… But we found Týr! Maybe if you spoke to him—

Freya: Týr is alive?

Atreus: Yeah. We, we broke him out of Svartalfheim.

Freya: Impossible. The Nine Realms are closed to all...

Atreus: No, we opened up the way. We just don't know where to go next. But if we all band together—

Freya: Enough… Enough. 

[She roughly pushes Atreus away with a vine.]

Freya: Leave this place. Go and do not return. Go, before I change my mind. Do not expect the same mercy for your father.

[She closes the passage to her with a thick vine. Atreus has no choice but to return to Sindri.]

[THE PATH: Old Friends completed!]

[Atreus moves away so Freya can't hear him, and decides to reflect a bit on what happened.]

Atreus: Okay, so I'm not dead. But I didn't get any answers. So this all might have just been a very big waste of time… which I will never, ever admit to Sindri. It's a good thing I like climbing! 

[Soon he finds a way to get to Sindri's store.]

Sindri: Oh, thank Ymir. You're alright. How did it go?! I was starting to think— 

Atreus: Sindri, I told you, I could handle it! But I don't think she's gonna help us. 

Sindri: Uh… where's your necklace? 

Atreus: Huh? Oh! I was thinking and I, uh, got rid of it. 

Sindri: She took it, didn't she? 

Atreus: Uh… 

Sindri: Today was your lucky day! So tell me, how did it feel to run on chaos? 

Atreus: I—

[Suddenly, the far side of the mountain breaks apart and a large monster emerges from it. He throws a fireball at Shindri's store and breaks it into pieces.]

Sindri: I JUST fixed that! 

Atreus: Örva ýta! 

Sindri: I've still got my bag of tricks. If you need me, I'll be…. standing back here. Need a moment! 

Atreus: Skjálfa!  Got 'em. 

Sindri: I'll repair it later… Let's get outta here before something else tries to kill us… 

Atreus: Yeah, good idea.

Sindri: Hate to bring it up, but are we telling your dad about this? Since you've come clean and all. 

Atreus: No way. He'd kill you. 

Sindri: Right. Well, speaking of coming clean, I need your… opinion on something. Something I've kept from my brother for a long time. I'll tell you on the way back. Come on. 

Atreus: Ugh! Do they ever quit? 

Sindri: Nightmares. Ugh, I'm gonna be sick. 

Atreus: Skjálfa! Ok, back to Alfheim tower. You were saying? 

Sindri: Long before you were born, there was an accident at the forge. Brok… died. I couldn't accept it. I went to the Lake of Souls in Alfheim to steal him back. Legions of souls tried to stop me. I can still feel them crawling all over my skin. Thing is… I could only get three of his four soul-parts back. 

Atreus: Sindri…

Sindri: Brok just thought he got knocked out. I've been lying to him ever since. It's been eating at me lately… 

Atreus: You have to tell him. He has a right to know. 

Sindri: When the time is right. As should you with your father. 

Atreus: That's not the same thing. 

[They are being attacked again.]

Atreus: Really? Now? Örva ýra!

Sindri: Gimme a second!

Atreus: Anyway… you did a good thing. You saved Brok's life. I caused trouble.

[Sindri proceeds to fix another elevator.]

Sindri: No. I made a choice. One that wasn't mine to make.

Atreus: What do you mean… a choice?

Sindri: I… I couldn't be alone. The other Dwarves, when they saw him they… shunned us. So we left. Made our own home.

Atreus: Well. You can't change the past, but it doesn't have to be who you are. Let's go home before Father wakes up. 

Sindri: That might be the best idea you've had all night, Tre'.

Atreus: Tre'?

[They take the elevator up.]

Sindri: It's a… shut up. So I'm not allowed to give you a nickname?

Atreus: Is that what that was?

Sindri: Whatever, Lok'. Nope. That was worse. I heard it when I said it. Alright. Shall we?

[Atreus opens the door between dimensions.]

Atreus: I hate coming home empty-handed. After Týr was such a failure, I just wanted to—

Sindri: Now hang on, little Jötunn. Týr may not be everything you expected, but a failure? You saved him from a terrible fate—that's not nothing. And hey, maybe he'll be some help to us yet.

Atreus: Maybe… but Father's not gonna go along with this forever. He's probably already got our next hiding place all picked out.

Sindri: Well, let's not make it worse by getting caught. When we get there, I'll cover our tracks at the gateway and slip around back, and you—just act natural. But… quickly.

[Atreus decides to explore the surroundings a bit.]

Sindri: W-what are you doing? You know it's not safe to leave the path.

Atreus: Yeah, yeah… I dunno, just like to look over it sometimes…

Sindri: Go, go, go!

[They walk back to Sindri's house. Before entering the house, Atreus decides to listen at the door.]

Kratos: That is not the risk that concerns me. Do we trust the path they would put us on?

Týr: I trust their wisdom. And this is the closest thing to hearing directly from them.

Kratos: You are certain the Giants would not counsel war?

Týr: I said that they were wise. In my experience, that goes with being peaceful.

[Atreus enters the house.]

Mimir: Oh, little brother! Told you we needn't worry.

Kratos: Atreus. Where have you been?

Atreus: Peeing.

Brok: Hope yer all hungry!

Atreus: I could eat.

[Sindri pretends he's been sleeping on the second floor this whole time and gives a fake yawn.]

Sindri: Ahhh… is everyone as well-rested as I am? Be right down.

[All the characters sit down at a small table to have lunch. Týr picks up a tiny sausage from his plate with his fork.]

Týr: Is this… sausage?

Brok: Uh… sure, why not?

Týr: I remember food tasting better.

Brok: Pfffft! I suppose you'd like to try cooking for this lot?

Týr: I accept!

Brok: …what?

Kratos: Atreus. We were planning our next move.

Atreus: Oh. So… where we going?

Kratos: Alfheim. Home of the elves.

Atreus: Alfheim? You hate Alfheim… why would we move there?

Kratos: Move there? No. We are seeking information.

Týr: The shrine of Gróa, young one. Your father tells me you found it there.

Atreus: Gróa, the Knowledge Keeper… Ohh—maybe there's a secret there I can unlock!

Mimir: Aye… who better than the seer who saw everything…?

Atreus: I wasn't sure you, um… Never mind. That's great. Alfheim!

Brok: Hey, don't go forgettin' this what'll get you there.

[He tosses Kratos some object resembling a rock.]

Sindri: You know what? I'm gonna build a bigger table.

[He walks away and Brok takes the food from his plate with his hand.]

Brok: More for me.

Atreus: Týr… you're really up for coming with us?

Týr: Whenever you're ready. Well, whenever your father's ready, I should say. If my counsel might help you towards the answers you seek, it's the least I can do to repay you. Plus… I think it will do me well to see the light of Alfheim again.

Brok: Mmm. That elf light is some goooood shit.

Atreus: So… where'd this plan come from?

Týr: Oh, from Mimir of course. I was merely asking how you found me, and he explained the secret prophecies inside the Jötnar shrines. Fascinating.

Mimir: From there we set to taking stock of which shrines we'd seen, at which point your father recalled finding Gróa's outside the Temple of Light. And now that we can actually go to Alfheim, the prudent course of action became self-evident.

Týr: Nary a lost step for the world's smartest man. Even without feet, if you'll forgive the levity. I was always fond of our talks, you know.

Mimir: Aye. And it's good to see you a free man again, old friend.

[Control is returned to Kratos. He gets up from the table.]

Týr: And thanks to you as well, Brok. These clothes do better than I deserve.

Brok: Darn straight. And never mind what Brok had to trade the landlord to get that Yggdrasil Seed for yuh's…

Atreus: The landlord?

Sindri: He's NOT the landlord!

Brok: Heh heh heh heh…

Atreus: Uh… okay…

[Kratos approaches Sindri at the forge.]

Sindri: He really did it. Týr really slept in my broom closet. Is that normal for you tall, godly sorts? Or just the ones locked up for a lifetime or two?

[Having updated his gear Kratos approaches the exit of the house.]

Atreus: Right behind you!

Týr: I'll meet you at the gateway presently, friends!

[Kratos approaches the portal between worlds and opens it. At that moment, someone speaks to him.]

The Squirrel: Excuse me, sir! Mind if I take a little peek at you? I promise I'll be brief.

[A large squirrel dressed in human clothing jumps on Kratos. The squirrel's left eye is bandaged.]

The Squirrel: My goodness, what a strapping physique. Capable of an astounding variety of acts of violence, I imagine.

[The squirrel sniffs at Kratos. He can barely contain his anger.]

Kratos: What is happening?

Mimir: This must be the squirrel that tends the World Tree!

Ratatoskr: That delectable aroma… Could it be? Pardon the intrusion

[Kratos takes the squirrel by the scruff of the neck and brings it to his face, while the squirrel manages to pull a stone out of his bag.]

Ratatoskr: Ah, yes, amber resin. Delightfully nutty with a hint of squid ink.

Kratos: No.

Ratatoskr: Not one for gastronomic exploration, I see.

[The squirrel begins to gnaw on the rock like a nut.]

Atreus: Wait… if you're Ratatoskr, why are you so different when we summon you for help?

Ratatoskr: It's a long story… But you are correct, I am indeed Ratatoskr. The one you know as Ratatoskr is merely one of my spectral aspects. And a particularly nasty one, at that. I consider him so far removed from myself that he's practically a different person. Speaking of, Bitter, would you like to come out and see your friends?

[A voice comes from somewhere.]

Bitter Squirrel: Fuck off, I'm busy!

Ratatoskr: I suppose that was to be expected. Anyway… Now that I've polished off all this resin for you… would you like the Seed back?

Kratos: It is a Seed?

Ratatoskr: Indeed! A Seed of Yggdrasil, to be precise. Since my Dwarven tenants performed their little reconfiguration, you'll need Seeds like these to open up new destinations on my tree.

Atreus: Your tree, huh?

Ratatoskr: Yes, MY tree. Here, let me show you… 

[Kratos approaches the door between worlds and brings the Seed to it.]

Ratatoskr: Ah, so that's why good Master Brok needed an Alfheim seed. Clearly you have important matters afoot. That seed you found unlocks Niflheim of all places. A realm as ancient hose a Realm to vaguely sticky. Svartalfheim remains at your disposal if you have unresolved business are a Realm to the Dwarves.

Atreus: If we're not going to Alfheim yet, it's probably best for Týr to wait for us here. The soldiers we fought in Svartalfheim—those were Einherjar?

[RATATOSKR]
A large and extremely talkative squirrel, who claims to take care of the World Tree. He is overly familiar, yet seems harmless and benevolent. His "spectral aspects" have aided us before, and may again. He revealed that the stone given to Atreus by Dínner was a "seed" for use in realm travel. If he continues to prove useful, I may tolerate his excessive blather.

[Kratos enters the portal between worlds with his son.]

Atreus: I thought Einherjar were just spirits in Valhalla until Ragnarök comes.

Kratos: They were no spirits.

Mimir: Indeed, brother. Odin appears to have found a loophole. Activated his forces early as a standing army. Perhaps something he could only do without any honest Valkyries around to stand in his way.

[They exit the portal between worlds and enter the snowy Svartalfheim. Not far from the portal is one of Brok and Sindri's stores.]

Brok: Do we HAVE ta be here? Creepin' me out, all these poor bastards with their souls cut up.

[Atreus runs up to a huge sprawling tree in the distance with many ghostly crows glowing white on its branches.]

Atreus: Wait. Are those… Odin's ravens? The ones we've been destroying all this time?

Kratos: So it would seem.

Voice Of The Ravens: Free are we! / Free of the father! / Our half-lives now / belong to no other!

Atreus: What do you think that means?

Mimir: I don't know. But there's definitely something more going on here.

Voice Of The Ravens: A gift of life, / a gift in death! To smother forever / the All-Father's breath!

Atreus: Their thoughts. I can't read them. They SEEM to like us, though.

Mimir: One hopes. I suppose we should continue to destroy any of Odin's ravens when we find them.

Atreus: There's something over here.

[They enter a vast arena with an icy obelisk in the center.]

Mimir: Ah… a memory of war. You could use this as a training arena, if you like. You'll just be fighting the recollections of enemies—they won't be able to harm you.

[Kratos decides to take advantage of the opportunity to train.]

Atreus: Here goes nothing. I can already feel us getting better. Let's go! Skjálfa!

Mimir: Behind you!

Atreus: Another Draugr, to the left! Learn anything new?

[After training, they enter the portal between worlds.]

Atreus: Mimir… I know this sounds weird, but… can you tell me again what happens when someone dies?

Mimir: Every living thing has a soul, and every soul has four parts: Form, mind, direction, and luck. Direction steers the souls of Giants, Dwarves, Elves, and animals toward the Lake of Souls in Alfheim, where all the parts may be absorbed back into Alfheim's great light.

Atreus: So that's where Fenrir is? The Lake of Souls?

Mimir: So long as his soul still has its direction, aye. It's well on its way.

[They come out of the portal. Týr had been sitting nearby the whole time.]

Týr: Ah, there you are. I knew you hadn't forgotten me.

Ratatoskr: Master Kratos, I would speak with you!

Atreus: Týr… do you know Ratatoskr?

Týr: Of course. We were just catching up in your absence Of the squirrels, five conversed with, he's easily the most dapper.

[Kratos approaches the squirrel.]

Kratos: Speak.

Ratatoskr: If you are ever in need of my services and I am not present, I have installed these handy chimes for you to notify me. Simply throw your Axe and strike the chimes and I will attend to your needs. Would you care to take a practice throw? A magnificent throw, Master Kratos, truly a seasoned pro. Very well. You know how to reach me now! All that said… I'm happy to discuss anything else on your mind. Splendid! I delight in offering my tutelage to the inquisitive.

Atreus: Over the ledge, by the gateway over there, I noticed these dragons…

Ratatoskr: Dragons! Oh no, young Master Atreus, those are Lindwyrms. The brood of Níðhögg.

Atreus: Níðhögg? That's the mother?

Ratatoskr: Correct! She's also a vital piece of the Yggdrasilian circle of life, as it were. I tend the branches up here, while Níðhögg chews the roots from below to prevent overgrowth. A delicate balance.

Atreus: So they're friendly?

Ratatoskr: Well, they're not nearly so affable as myself, but there's no reason to expect hostility so long as they're left in peace. Níðhögg is a stern matriarch as protective of her offspring as she is determined to teach them proper discipline.

Atreus: That sounds… 

Mimir: …familiar.

Kratos: (acknowledging grunt)

Ratatoskr: Well. Stay safe, everyone.

Bitter Squirrel: We're done talking. Bugger off.

[Kratos opens a portal to Alfheim.]

Týr: Perhaps as we travel you can tell me the tale of your prior visit to the land of the Elves.

Atreus: Sure I can… Alfheim was the first time we ever realm-traveled using your temple. Freya tried coming with us, but Odin cast a spell on her. She can't leave Midgard.

Týr: That's terrible.

Atreus: So then we fought our way through an army of Dark Elves to get to the Light—

Týr: You interfered in the Elf War?

Kratos: Not by choice. We sought to fill our Bifröst, and they attacked us.

Atreus: And the Dark Elves were covering it with their sticky hive stuff. When we freed it, the Light Elves came back. Things seemed better in Alfheim.

Týr: Did they now?

[They're coming out of the portal.]

THE PATH: Gróa's Secret
